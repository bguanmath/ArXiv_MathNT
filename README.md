 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Michael R. Powers &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $γ= 0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $δ= 0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $γ+ δ/e = \mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $γ^{(n)} + δ^{(n)}/e = η^{(n)}$; $n \ge 0$ for sequences of constants $γ^{(n)}$, $δ^{(n)}$, and $η^{(n)}$ (given respectively by raw, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). Investigating the $γ^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations, we find that at least one of the pair {$γ,γ^{(2)}$} and at least two of each of the sets {$γ,γ^{(2)},γ^{(3)},γ^{(4)}$}, {$γ,γ^{(3)},γ^{(4)},\ldots,γ^{(6)}$}, and {$γ,γ^{(4)},γ^{(5)},\ldots,γ^{(8)}$} are transcendental, implying analogous results for the sequence $Γ^{(n)}(1)=\left(-1\right)^{n}γ^{\left(n\right)}$. We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $η^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent, and therefore transcendental, for all $n \ge 0$, implying that at least one of each pair, {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e$} and {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e,δ^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n \ge 1$. Further analysis of the $γ^{(n)}$ and $η^{(n)}$ reveals that the values $δ^{(n)}/e$ are transcendental infinitely often, with the density of the set of transcendental terms having asymptotic lower bound $1/2-o(1)$. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tildeδ^{(n)}$ and $\tildeη^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $γ^{(n)} + \tildeδ^{(n)}/e = \tildeη^{(n)}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Donoso, Le, Moreira and Sun studied the asymptotic behavior of the averages of completely multiplicative functions over the Gaussian integers. They derived Wirsing's theorem for Gaussian integers, answered a question of Frantzikinakis and Host for sum of two squares, and obtained a variant of a theorem of Bergelson and Richter on ergodic averages along the number of prime factors of integers. In this paper, we will show the analogue of these results for co-prime integer pairs. Moreover, building on Frantzikinakis and Host's results, we obtain some convergences on the multilinear averages of multiplicative functions over primitive lattice points.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Russelle Guadalupe &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** completely updated by adding infinite families of congruences for $c$-elongated plane partitions; 7 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an integer $c\geq 1$, let $a_c(n)$ count the number of generalized cubic partitions of $n$, which are partitions of $n$ whose even parts may appear in $c$ different colors, and $d_c(n)$ count the number of partitions obtained by adding the links of the $c$-elongated plane partition diamonds of length $n$. We prove in this note infinite families of congruences modulo $7$ and $11$ for $a_c(n)$ and $d_c(n)$ by employing elementary $q$-series techniques. These results generalize particular congruences modulo $7$ and $11$ for $a_c(n)$ and $d_c(n)$ recently found by Dockery, and Baruah, Das, and Talukdar, respectively, using modular forms.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 6 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G_1, \dots, G_k$ be finite-dimensional vector spaces over a prime field $\mathbb{F}_p$. Let $V$ be a variety inside $G_1 \times \cdots \times G_k$ defined by a multilinear map. We show that if $|V| \geq c |G_1| \cdots |G_k|$, then $V$ contains a subvariety defined by at most $K(\log_{p} c^{-1} + 1)$ multilinear forms, where $K$ depends on $k$ only. This result is optimal up to multiplicative constant and is relevant to the partition vs. analytic rank problem in additive combinatorics.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Tropicalisation (with trivial coefficients) is a process that turns a polynomial equation into a combinatorial predicate on subsets of the set of variables. We show that for each minuscule representation of a simple reductive group, there is a set of quadratic equations cutting out the orbit of the highest weight vector whose tropicalisation characterises the set of Coxeter matroids for that representation which satisfy the strong exchange property.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Version 1: 16 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the first part of the paper, we fix a non-CM elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ and an odd prime $\ell$ and investigate the distribution of invariants associated to the $\ell$-volcano containing the reduction $E_p$, as $p$ ranges over primes of good ordinary reduction. Let $H(p)$ be the height of the volcano and let $d'(p)$ denote the relative position of $j(E_p)$ above the floor, and let $r\ge 0$ be an integer. Assuming that the $\ell$-adic Galois representation attached to $E$ is surjective, we derive an explicit formula for the natural density of primes $p$ for which $H(p)=r$ (resp.\ $d'(p)=r$). In the non-surjective case, we show that all sufficiently large heights occur with positive density. In the second part of the paper, we analyze the distribution of $\ell$-volcano heights over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ and consider the limit as $q\to\infty$. Using analytic estimates for sums of Hurwitz class numbers in arithmetic progressions, we compute exact limiting densities for ordinary elliptic curves whose $\ell$-isogeny graph has a prescribed height $r$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Geoffrey Powell &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** v4 further improvements to the exposition; 19 pages. (v3 minor revision together with addition of an Appendix; 17 pages. v2 Very minor revision. 14 pages.)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The homology of free Lie algebras with coefficients in tensor products of the adjoint representation working over Q contains important information on the homological properties of polynomial outer functors on free groups. The latter category was introduced in joint work with Vespa, motivated by the study of higher Hochschild homology of wedges of circles. There is a splitting of this homology by polynomial degree (for polynomiality with respect to the generators of the free Lie algebra) and one can consider the polynomial degree relative to the number of tensor factors in the coefficients. It suffices to consider the Lie algebra homology in homological degree one; this vanishes in relative degree 0 and is readily calculated in relative degree 1. This paper calculates the homology in relative degree 2, which presents interesting features. This confirms a conjecture of Gadish and Hainaut.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The exponential Freiman dimension of a finite set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^{m}$, introduced by Green and Tao in 2006, represents the largest positive integer $d$ for which $A$ contains the vertices of a non-degenerate $d$-dimensional parallelepiped. For every $d \geq 1$, we precisely determine the largest constant $C_{d}>0$ (exponential in $d$) for which $$|A+A| \geq C_{d}|A| - O_{d}(1)$$ holds for all sets $A$ with exponential Freiman dimension $d$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any sufficiently large $\ell$, suppose that $\ell$ can be expressed as $ \ell=p_1^4+p_2^4+p_3^4+p_4^4$, where $p_1, p_2,p_3,p_4$ are primes.For such $\ell$, in this paper we will use circle method and sieves to prove that the proportion of $\ell$ in positive integers is at least $\frac{1}{27241.64}$ .</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Vyacheslav Futorny, Xingpeng Liu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 39 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider two algebraic invariants in the representation theory of quantized enveloping algebras: the dimension growth of simple modules for the De Concini-Kac quantum group at roots of unity, and the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of simple highest weight modules for the quantum group at generic $q$. In spite of being defined for different values of the parameter $q$, these invariants reflect closely related features in the respective contexts. We show that several new phenomena appear in the quantum case and the representations with non-integral weights contribute to both invariants in a way that cannot be ignored. Building on this, we determine the minimal non-zero value of these invariants for each Lie type. As an application we show that quantum cuspidal modules at generic $q$ can occur only when the underlying semisimple Lie algebra has simple components of type $A$, $B$, or $C$, providing a more explicit representation-theoretic distinction with the classical case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine precisely when the branching coefficients arising from the restriction of irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ to the dihedral subgroup $D_n$ are nonzero, and we establish uniform linear lower bounds outside a finite exceptional family. As a consequence, we recover and substantially generalize known positivity results for cyclic subgroups $C_n \leq S_n$. Analogous results are obtained for the alternating group $A_n$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Valery Asiryan &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** We do not address the global open problem of non-trivial solutions to a^5+b^5=c^5+d^5 without linear constraints

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Diophantine equation $a^5+b^5=c^5+d^5$ under the linear slicing constraint $(c+d)-(a+b)=h$. We first establish the necessary modular constraint $30 \mid h$. For any nonzero slice $h$, the problem reduces to finding rational points on a genus-one fibration over $\mathbb{Q}(S)$. Passing to the Jacobian fibration $E_h/\mathbb{Q}(S)$, we identify a global rational $2$-torsion section and prove that $E_h$ never admits full rational $2$-torsion. This is achieved by reducing the splitting condition of the $2$-division field to finding rational points on a universal genus-two hyperelliptic curve, for which we rigorously verify the set of rational points using the method of Chabauty and Coleman. We further show that the Jacobian fibrations for all $h \neq 0$ are isomorphic over a rational function field. Focusing on the representative slice $h=30$, we compute the explicit invariants of the elliptic surface and apply the Gusić--Tadić injectivity criterion for the specialization homomorphism. Based on verified computations of specialized ranks, we establish the uniform upper bound $\mathrm{rank}\,E_h(\mathbb{Q}(S)) \le 1$ for all $h \neq 0$. Finally, we discuss the additional inequality and parity constraints required to recover integer solutions from the fibration.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 64 pages, 2 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the Hausdorff dimension of naturally occurring sets of inhomogeneous well-approximable points with a sequence of real invertible matrices $\mathcal{A}=(A_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$. Specifically, for a given point $\mathbf{y}\in [0,1)^d$ and a function $ψ: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}^+$, we study the limsup set $$ W\big(\mathcal{A},ψ,{\bf y}\big) =\Big\{\mathbf{x}\in [0,1)^d\colon A_n\mathbf{x}~(\bmod~1)\in B\big(\mathbf{y}, ψ(n)\big) {\rm ~ for~ infinitely ~many}~n\in\mathbb{N}\Big\}.$$ The upper and lower bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of $W\big(\mathcal{A},ψ,{\bf y}\big)$ are determined by involving the singular values of $A_n$ and the successive minima of the lattice $A_n^{-1}\mathbb{Z}^d$, and both bounds are shown to be attainable for some matrices. Within this framework, we unify the problem of shrinking target sets and recurrence sets, establishing the Hausdorff dimensions for such limsup sets. As applications, our corresponding upper bounds for shrinking target and recurrence sets essentially improve those appearing in the present literature. Furthermore, explicit Hausdorff dimension formulas are derived for shrinking targets and recurrence sets associated with concrete classes of matrices. We extend the Mass Transference Principle for rectangles of Li-Liao-Velani-Wang-Zorin (Adv. Math., 2025) to rectangles under local isometries. This generalization yields a general lower bound for the Hausdorff dimension of $W\big(\mathcal{A},ψ,{\bf y}\big)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a group acting on a field $L$, and suppose that $L /L^G$ is a finite extension. We show that the irreducible semilinear representations of $G$ over $L$ can be completely described in terms of irreducible linear representations of $H$, the kernel of the map $G \rightarrow \mathrm{Aut}(L)$. When $G$ is finite and $|G| \in L^{\times}$ this provides a character theory for semilinear representations of $G$ over $L$, which recovers ordinary character theory when the action of $G$ on $L$ is trivial.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 35 pages, revised version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use height arguments to prove two results about the dynamical Mordell-Lang problem. (i) For an endomorphism of a projective variety, the return set of a dense orbit into a curve is finite if any cohomological Lyapunov multiplier of any iteration is not an integer. (ii) Let $f\times g:X\times C\rightarrow X\times C$ be an endomorphism, where $f$ and $g$ are surjective endomorphisms of a projective variety $X$ and a projective curve $C$, respectively. If the degree of $g$ is greater than the first dynamical degree of $f$, then the return sets of the system $(X\times C,f\times g)$ have the same form as the return sets of the system $(X,f)$. Using the second result, we deal with the case of split self-maps of products of curves, for which the degrees of the factors are pairwise distinct. In the cases that the height argument cannot be applied, we find examples which show that the return set can be very complicated -- more complicated than experts once imagined -- even for endomorphisms of tori with zero entropy. One may compare them with the conjectures and results stated in [CGSZ21] and [XY25].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Glaisher's theorem states that the number of partitions of $n$ into parts which repeat at most $m-1$ times is equal to the number of partitions of $n$ into parts which are not divisible by $m$. The $m=2$ case is Euler's famous partition theorem. Recently, Andrews, Kumar, and Yee gave two new partition functions $C(n)$ and $D(n)$ related to Euler's theorem. Lin and Zhang extended their result to Glaisher's theorem by generalizing $C(n)$. We generalize $D(n)$, prove an analogous partition identity for the $m=3$ case, and show that the general case is an example of an almost partition identity. We also provide a new series equal to Glaisher's product both in the finite and infinite cases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian category with a torsion pair $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$. Happel-Reiten-Smalo tilting provides a method to construct a new abelian category $\mathcal{B}$ with a torsion pair associated to $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$, which is exactly the heart of a certain $t$-structure on the bounded derived category $D^b(\mathcal{A})$. In this paper, we mainly study generalized HRS tilting. We first show that an interval of torsion pairs in extriangulated categories with negative first extensions is bijectively associated with torsion pairs in the corresponding heart, which yields several new observations in triangulated categories. Then we obtain a generalization of HRS tilting by replacing hearts of $t$-structures with extended hearts. As an application, we show that certain $t$-structures on triangulated subcategories can be extended to $t$-structures on the whole triangulated categories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of AIR tilting subcategories of extended hearts of $t$-structures on a triangulated category associated with silting subcategories. This notion extends $τ_{[d]}$-tilting pairs of extended finitely generated modules over finite-dimensional algebras to a broader framework, encompassing extended large modules over unitary rings as well as truncated subcategories of finite-dimensional derived categories of proper non-positive differential graded algebras. Within this framework, we establish a bijection between AIR tilting subcategories and silting subcategories. We further define quasi-tilting and tilting subcategories of extended hearts, generalizing the corresponding notions in module categories, and investigate their fundamental properties and the relationships among these three tilting-related concepts.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>$τ$-tilting theory can be thought of as a generalization of the classical tilting theory which allows mutations at any indecomposable summand of a support $τ$-tilting pair. Indeed, for any algebra $Λ$ its tilting modules $\text{tilt}\,Λ$ form a subposet of the support $τ$-tilting poset $\text{s}τ-\text{tilt}\,Λ$. We show that conversely the $τ$-tilting theory of an algebra $Λ$ can be naturally identified with the classical tilting theory of its duplicated algebra $\barΛ$ by establishing a poset isomorphism $\text{s}τ-\text{tilt}\,Λ\cong \text{tilt}\,\barΛ$. As a result, $τ$-tilting theory may be considered to be a special case of tilting theory. This extends the results of Assem-Brüstle-Schiffler-Todorov in the case of hereditary algebras. We also show that the product $\text{s}τ-\text{tilt}\,Λ\times \text{s}τ-\text{tilt}\,Λ$ embeds into the support $τ$-tilting poset of its duplicated algebra $\text{s}τ-\text{tilt}\,\barΛ$ as a collection of Bongartz intervals. As an application we obtain a similar inclusion on the level of maximal green sequences.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cut and project sets are obtained by projecting an irrational slice through a lattice to a lower dimensional subspace. Under standard conditions, the resulting pattern has no translational periods even though it retains some regularity of the lattice. Cut and project sets are one of the archetypical examples of patterns featuring aperiodic order, the other construction methods being by substitution and matching rules. Many early examples of aperiodic tilings, including the famous Penrose and Ammann--Beenker tilings, have a description from all of these methods. In this article we answer the following question, in the case of a Euclidean total space: what property of the cut and project data characterises when the resulting cut and project sets may also be defined by a substitution rule?</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The seminal paper "J.T. Stafford, Module structure of Weyl algebras, J. London Math. Soc. (2) 18 (1978), no. 3, 429--442" was a major step forward in our understanding of Weyl algebras. Beginning with Serre's Theorem on free summands of projective modules and Bass' Stable Range Theorem in commutative algebra, we attempt to trace the origins of this work and explain how it led to Stafford's construction of non-holonomic simple modules over Weyl algebras. We also describe Bernstein-Lunt's geometric construction of infinite families of non-holonomic simple modules. We recall more recent developments related to Weyl algebras, especially that of parametrizing right ideals in the first Weyl algebra and its relation to Calogero-Moser spaces. Finally, we revisit Stafford's results in the context of quantized symplectic singularities, where they lead naturally to open problems on the behaviour of simple modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove non-trivial bounds for bilinear forms with hyper-Kloosterman sums with characters modulo a prime $q$ which, for both variables of length $M$, are non-trivial as soon as $M\geq q^{3/8+δ}$ for any $δ>0$. This range, which matches Burgess's range, is identical with the best results previously known only for simpler exponentials of monomials. The proof combines refinements of the analytic tools from our previous paper and new geometric methods. The key geometric idea is a comparison statement that shows that even when the "sum-product" sheaves that appear in the analysis fail to be irreducible, their decomposition reflects that of the "input" sheaves, except for parameters in a high-codimension subset. This property is proved by a subtle interplay between étale cohomology in its algebraic and diophantine incarnations. We prove a first application concerning the first moment of a family of $L$-functions of degree $3$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider multiple zeta values, which are periods of mixed Tate motives over $\mathbb Z$. For a given multiple zeta value $ζ$, there exists a unique minimal motive $M(ζ)$ such that $ζ$ is a period of $M(ζ)$. In general, the motive $M(ζ)$ is difficult to compute. In this article, we compute the minimal motive $M(a,b)$ associated to a given double zeta value $ζ(a,b)$. We also compute the motivic Galois group $G(a,b)$ associated to $ζ(a,b)$ and discuss its dimension. Moreover, we give a period matrix of $M(a,b)$. The period conjecture predicts that the dimension of $G(a,b)$ equals the transcendence degree of the algebra of periods of $M(a,b)$. Hence our results lead to conjectures about algebraic relations between single and double zeta values.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $N$ be normal subgroup of a finite group $G$, $p$ be a prime, $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ and $θ$ be a $P$-invariant irreducible character of $N$. Suppose that $G/N$ is a $p$-solvable group. In this note we show that, whenever a finite group $A$ acts on $G$ stabilizing $P$, there exists an $A$-equivariant McKay bijection between irreducible characters lying over $θ$ of degree prime to $p$ of $G$ and $\textbf{N}_G(P)$. This is a consequence of a recent result of D. Rossi. Our approach here is independent from Rossi's and follows the original idea of the proof of the McKay conjecture for $p$-solvable groups. In particular, we rely on the so-called Okuyama-Wajima argument to deal with characters above Glauberman correspondents. For this purpose, we generalize a classical result of P. X.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A well supported conjecture states that SIC-POVMs -- maximal sets of complex equiangular lines -- with anti-unitary symmetry give rise to an identity expressing some of its overlaps as squares of the (rescaled) components of a suitably chosen fiducial vector. In number theoretical terms the identity essentially expresses Stark units as sums of products of pairs of square roots of Stark units. We investigate whether the identity is enough to determine these Stark units. The answer is no, but the failure might be quite mild.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A filtration of the morphisms of the $k$-linearization $k \mathbf{FS}$ of the category $\mathbf{FS}$ of finite sets and surjections is constructed using a natural $k \mathbf{FI}^{op}$-module structure induced by restriction, where $\mathbf{FI}$ is the category of finite sets and injections. In particular, this yields the `primitive' subcategory $ k \mathbf{FS}^0 \subset k \mathbf{FS}$ that is of independent interest; for example, the category of $k \mathbf{FS}^0$-modules is closely related to the category of $k \mathbf{FA}$-modules, where $\mathbf{FA}$ is the category of finite sets and all maps. Working over a field of characteristic zero, the subquotients of this filtration are identified as bimodules over $k \mathbf{FB}$, where $\mathbf{FB}$ is the category of finite sets and bijections, also exhibiting and exploiting additional structure. In particular, this describes the underlying $k \mathbf{FB}$-bimodule of $k \mathbf{FS}^0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Positional numeration systems are a large family of numeration systems used to represent natural numbers. Whether the set of all representations forms a regular language or not is one of the most important questions that can be asked of such a system. This question was investigated in a 1998 article by Hollander. Central to his analysis is a property linking positional numeration systems and Rényi numeration systems, which use a real base to represent real numbers. However, this link only exists when the initial numeration system has a dominant root, which is not a necessary condition for regularity. In this article, we show a more general link between positional numeration systems and alternate base numeration systems, a family generalizing Rényi systems. We then take advantage of this link to provide a full characterization of those numeration systems that generate a regular language. We also discuss the effectiveness of our method, and comment Hollander's results and conjecture in the light of ours.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $Γ\subset PSL_2(\mathbb{R})$ be a Fuchsian group of the first kind which has a cusp $i\infty$ of width one. In this paper, we first consider a generating function formed with the Niebur--Poincaré series $\{F_{m,s}(τ)\}_{m\ge 1}$ associated to $i\infty$. We prove a relation between the continuation of this generating function to $s=1$ with the resolvent kernel associated to the hyperbolic Laplacian and the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series associated to $i\infty$, also at $s=1$. Secondly, we show that, for any $s\in \mathbb{N}$, the generating function equals Poincaré type series involving polylogarithms. We also consider a generating function formed with derivatives in $s$ of the Niebur--Poincaré series and prove that the continuation of the generating function at $s=1$ can be expressed in terms of $Γ$-periodization of a point-pair invariant involving the Rogers dilogarithm and the Kronecker limit function associated to the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series.</p></details>

Results include positive resolutions of the conjectured infinitude of primes $p$ for which $\bullet$ $\frac{p-1}{2}$ is prime; $\bullet$ a non-perfect-square $-1\neq m\in\mathbb{Z}$ is a primitive root $\pmod p$; establishing as manifest the efficacy of ultraproduct treatments in resolving number theory problems requiring authentication of countably infinite conforming sets.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Section 2.1 was extended significantly

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study $t$-structures (on triangulated categories) that are closely related to weight structures. A $t$-structure couple $t=(C_{t\le 0},C_{t\ge 0})$ is said to be adjacent to a weight structure $w=(C_{w\le 0}, C_{w\ge 0})$ if $C_{t\ge 0}=C_{w\ge 0}$. For a category $C$ that satisfies the Brown representability property we prove that $t$ that is adjacent to $w$ exists if and only if $w$ is smashing (that is, "respects C-coproducts"). The heart $Ht$ of this $t$ is the category of those functors $Hw^{op}\to Ab$ that respect products (here $Hw$ is the heart of $w$); the result has important applications. We prove several more statements on constructing $t$-structures starting from weight structures; we look for a strictly orthogonal $t$-structure $t$ on some $C'$ (where $C,C'$ are triangulated subcategories of a common $D$) such that $C'_{t\le 0}$ (resp. $C'_{t\ge 0}$) is characterized by the vanishing of morphisms from $C_{w\ge 1}$ (resp. $C_{w\le -1}$). Some of these results generalize properties of semi-orthogonal decompositions proved in the previous paper, and can be applied to various derived categories of (quasi)coherent sheaves on a scheme $X$ that is projective over an affine noetherian one. We also study hearts of orthogonal $t$-structures and their restrictions, and prove some statements on "reconstructing" weight structures from orthogonal $t$-structures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper introduces and systematically studies a class of Weyl-type algebras enriched with hyperbolic sine and power generators over a field of characteristic zero, defined as $A_{p,t,\cA} = \Weyl{\sinh(\pm x^{p} \sinh(t)),\; \sinh(\cA x),\; x^{\cA}}$ in the associative setting and $\Nass{\sinh(\pm x^{p} \sinh(t)),\; \sinh(\cA x),\; x^{\cA}}$ in a non-associative framework. We establish fundamental structural properties, including the triviality of the center for the non-associative version and the explicit description $Z(A_{p,t,\cA}) = \FF[\sinh(\pm x^{p} \sinh(t))]$ for the associative one, proving that $A_{p,t,\cA}$ is an Azumaya algebra over its center and represents a nontrivial class in the Brauer group $\Br(\FF(y))$. Furthermore, we compute the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension for relevant examples and demonstrate its key properties, such as additivity under tensor products and the growth dichotomy. We completely characterize the automorphism group of $A_{p,t,\cA}$ as a semidirect product of a torus with a discrete group, and provide a sharp isomorphism criterion showing that the parameter $t$ is a complete invariant in the family. The paper concludes with two open problems concerning the GK dimension of non-associative hyperbolic sine algebras and the classification of their deformations, pointing toward future research directions in non-associative growth theory and deformation rigidity.</p></details>

We establish a nontrivial power-saving bound of $B(H,N)$ for the range of the shift $H\ge N^{1-\frac{4}{d_1+d_2}+\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon>0$. For the cases $d_1 = d_2 + 1$ and $d_1 = d_2$, our result extends a result that can be derived from a theorem of Friedlander and Iwaniec. In particular, when $d_1 = d_2$, we reach the critical threshold $H\ge N^{1-2/d+\varepsilon}$ such that any further improvement in this range yields a subconvexity bound for the corresponding standard $L$-function in the $t$-aspect.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the triangular prism equations (TPE) for fusion categories, obtained by evaluating triangular prisms in terms of tetrahedra. Using an oriented graphical calculus, we show that the geometric symmetries of the regular tetrahedron are preserved. In the spherical case, we prove that the TPE are equivalent to the pentagon equations after a suitable change of basis. These equations provide new insight for managing complexity via localization. As a consequence, and using the Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert theorem on the second Frobenius-Schur indicator, we obtain new categorification criteria. As an application, we solve all remaining open cases to complete the classification of unitary 1-Frobenius simple integral fusion categories up to rank 8 and up to Frobenius-Perron dimension 20000.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In [DP12], Delzant and Py showed that there exist continuous irreducible isometric actions of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ on the infinite-dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^\infty$. Such continuous irreducible actions do not exist on the hyperbolic spaces $\mathbb{H}^n$ when $n>2$ and their associated embeddings $\mathbb{H}^2 \to \mathbb{H}^\infty$ given by the orbit maps were later called exotic by Monod and Py in [MP14]. In this article, we produce a continuous and irreducible representation of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})\to \mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^\infty)$ using the hyperbolic model for convex bodies introduced in [DF22]. This yields a convex cocompact $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$-action on the infinite-dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^\infty$, of which the compact quotient over the minimal $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$-invariant convex set is homeomorphic to the 2-dimensional oriented Banach--Mazur compactum. Moreover, we study the geometry of one of its orbit maps and compute the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of this representation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study very smooth functions on the real line, namely Schwartz functions, that satisfy a finite identity relating their translates and a single modulation. Concretely, we assume there is a nontrivial linear combination of translates of the function that equals a fixed frequency shift of the same function. Passing to the Fourier transform turns this into a multiplicative transfer relation: the value of the Fourier transform at one point is obtained by multiplying its value at another point by a trigonometric polynomial. Iterating this relation expresses the Fourier transform along an arithmetic progression as a product of such trigonometric factors times a fixed initial value. We then recast this product in an ergodic theoretic framework by viewing it as a Birkhoff sum for a continuous observable on a compact abelian group generated by a diagonal unitary matrix. The key quantity controlling the growth or decay of the Fourier transform along the progression is a space average, namely the integral over the compact group of the logarithm of the absolute value of the associated trigonometric polynomial. The main rigorously proved statement is the following. If, for some frequency where the Fourier transform does not vanish along the entire progression, this space average is nonzero, or if the average is zero but a certain recurrence set, in the sense of Atkinson's theorem, intersects a distinguished one-parameter subgroup, then the assumed translation--modulation identity forces exponential growth of the Fourier transform along some sequence of points. This contradicts the rapid decay required of a Schwartz function.</p></details>

Cluster variables of $\mathcal{A}$ correspond to $σ$-orbits of arcs of $\mathbf{S}$, while clusters are given by admissible $σ$-invariant ideal triangulations. We provide a cluster expansion formula for any $σ$-orbit $[γ]$ in terms of perfect matchings of some labeled modified snake graphs constructed from the arcs of $[γ]$. Then, we associate a symmetric finite-dimensional algebra $A$ to any seed of $\mathcal{A}$, such that non-initial cluster variables bijectively correspond to orthogonal indecomposable $A$-modules. Finally, we exhibit a purely representation-theoretic map from the category of orthogonal $A$-modules to $\mathcal{A}$. If $\mathbf{S}$ is a regular polygon, we recover the results proved in arXiv:2403.11308, arXiv:2405.14915, and arXiv:2502.06410 for cluster algebras of type B.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Bondal-Kapranov's notion of enhanced triangulated categories behaves well in the framework of localization theory, in the sense that the Verdier quotient of triangulated categories can be lifted to the Drinfeld dg quotient of pretriangulated dg categories. In this paper, we develop a parallel enhancement for Nakaoka-Palu's notion of extriangulated categories, which unifies exact and triangulated categories. The enhancement of extriangulated categories was recently initiated by Xiaofa Chen under the name exact dg categories. Moreover, it is known that certain ideal quotients of extriangulated categories remain extriangulated, and that such ideal quotients admit dg enhancements via the dg quotient of the corresponding connective exact dg category. Motivated by Chen's framework of enhanced extriangulated categories, we introduce the concept of a cohomological envelope of an exact dg category and generalize his construction of the enhanced ideal quotient. We show that the dg quotient of exact dg categories, when passing to cohomological envelopes and their substructures -- referred to as exact dg subquotients -- is compatible with a broad class of extriangulated quotients in the sense of Nakaoka-Ogawa-Sakai. To further clarify the scope of our approach, we formulate the notion of an extriangulated subquotient, which enables the localization of any extriangulated category by extension-closed subcategories. This construction encompasses not only ideal and Verdier quotients, but also the quotient of an exact category by a biresolving subcategory. Notably, the extriangulated subquotient admits a natural lifting to the exact dg subquotient.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In arXiv:2407.11958, a moduli stack parametrizing $I$--indexed diagrams of Higgs bundles over a base stack $X$ was constructed for any finite simplicial set $I$, inspiring speculations about extending the non-Abelian Hodge correspondence to these moduli stacks. In the present work, we formalize the de Rham side of this conjectural extension. We construct moduli stacks parametrizing diagrams of bundles with $λ$--connections over a base prestack $X$, where $λ$ can be a fixed number or a parameter. Taking $λ$ to be $1$ gives a moduli stack parametrizing diagrams of bundles with connection, while taking it to be a parameter gives a version of Simpson's non-Abelian Hodge filtration for digrams of bundles with connection. We show that when $X$ is a smooth and projective scheme over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$, these moduli stacks are algebraic and locally of finite presentation, and have affine diagonal.</p></details>

Under a mild assumption on the Frobenius eigenvalues of $D:=D_{\mathrm{cris}}(r)$ and under the usual Taylor-Wiles conditions, we show that the locally analytic representation of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ associated to $ρ$ in the corresponding Hecke eigenspace of the completed $H^0$ contains an explicit finite length subrepresentation which determines and only depends on $r$. This generalizes previous results of the second author which assumed that the Hodge filtration on $D$ was as generic as possible. Our approach provides a much more explicit link to this Hodge filtration (in all cases), which allows to study the internal structure of this finite length locally analytic subrepresentation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We assemble three basic analytic inputs -- the Kuznetsov trace formula on $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ with explicit continuous spectrum, the $\mathrm{GL}_3$ Voronoi formula, and $t$-aspect second-moment bounds for $L(1/2+it,\varphi)$ -- into a single framework for a smoothed $\mathrm{GL}_3$ spectral average. For a fixed Hecke-Maass cusp form $\varphi$ on $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb Z)$, we evaluate a weight-$0$ spectral average of $L(1/2,\varphi\times f_j)$ over the $\mathrm{GL}_2$ Maass spectrum. In the Kuznetsov normalization where the diagonal transform has density $t\tanh(πt)$, the diagonal contributes exactly $2\mathcal H_0[h]$; the off-diagonal and the continuous spectrum are bounded with power savings consistent with the currently best unconditional second-moment bounds in the $\mathrm{GL}_3$ $t$-aspect. The argument is organized into a sequence of steps: normalizations and approximate functional equations, insertion into Kuznetsov, Voronoi summation on $\mathrm{GL}_3$, a bilinear estimate for the off-diagonal, evaluation of the diagonal and the Eisenstein contribution, moment refinements and parameter optimization, and finally plateau-smooth spectral windows and standard generalizations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Stanley sequences starting from the set $\{0, n\}$ where $n$ is a positive integer have long been conjectured to be divided into two types: the "regular" type where the growth rate is $Θ(n^{\log_2(3)})$, and the "irregular" type where the growth rate is thought to be $Θ(n^2/\log n)$. A paradigmatic case of a candidate irregular type is $n=4$, although to date no value of $n$ has been proven to have such a growth rate. Here, we provide strong numerical evidence against this conjectured growth rate for $n=4$. Specifically, for $n=4$, it seems plausible that the upper bound is $O(n^2/\log n)$ but that the lower bound is in fact $Ω(n^{2-δ})$ for some $δ> 0$. This appears to be because the sequence is not totally "random" as has been assumed. Limitations of the numerical method here is discussed.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by some previously known facts from mathematical and physics literature, we explore certain relations between 3-dimensional topological gauge theories with continuous and finite gauge groups, commonly known as Chern-Simons (CS) and Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories, respectively. Specifically, we consider the continuous and finite gauge groups to be the same algebraic group over the complex numbers and a finite field, respectively. In this paper, we focus on the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ example and consider the relationship on the level of the corresponding partition functions on closed 3-manifolds. Mathematically, these are Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev and DW invariants. We find that the asymptotics of the DW theory when the number of elements of the finite field is large recovers the leading asymptotics of the CS theory at large level when the 3-manifold contains no hyperbolic components. As a byproduct, we develop efficient techniques to count the number of points over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$ of $\mathrm{SL}(2)$ representation varieties of fundamental groups of 3-manifolds, possibly with weights pulled back from a chosen class in $H^3(\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{F}_q),\mathrm{U}(1))$.</p></details>

In particular, we show that if $π$ and $π'$ are any irreducible smooth representations of $\mathrm{GL_{n+1}(F)}$ and $\mathrm{GL_{n}(F)}$ respectively, and their Langlands data or Zelevinsky data are given in terms of multisegments, then through an algorithmic process we can determine whether the space $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{GL_n(F)}}(π, π')$ is non-zero. Finally, when one of the represntations $π$ and $ π'$ is a generalized Speh representation, we give a complete classification for the other one for which the Hom space is non-zero.</p></details>

For $x>0$ functions are non intersecting and form a dense subset of $(0,1)$. Furthermore, when evaluating the tree for positive rational values, the tree contains every rational in $(0,1)$ exactly once if and only if $x\in \mathbb{N}$. For $x=1$, one finds back the classical Farey tree which is related to regular continued fractions. In the last part, we will make a similar tree in a similar way but for backward continued fractions. We highlight some similarities and differences.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The long root geometry $A_{n,\{1,n\}}(\mathbb{K})$ for the special linear group $\mathrm{SL}(n+1,\mathbb{K})$ admits an embedding in the (projective space of) the vector space of the traceless square matrices of order $n+1$ with entries in the field $\mathbb{K}$, usually regarded as the {\em natural} embedding of $A_{n,\{1,n\}}(\mathbb{K})$. S. Smith and H. Völklein (A geometric presentation for the adjoint module of $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{K})$, {\em J. Algebra}, vol. 127) have proved that the natural embedding of $A_{2,\{1,2\}}(\mathbb{K})$ is relatively universal if and only if $\mathbb{K}$ is either algebraic over its minimal subfield or perfect with positive characteristic. They also give some information on the relatively universal embedding of $A_{2,\{1,2\}}(\mathbb{K})$ which covers the natural one, but that information is not sufficient to exhaustively describe it. The "if" part of Smith-Völklein's result also holds true for any $n$, as proved by Völklein in his investigation of the adjoint modules of Chevalley groups (H. Völklein, On the geometry of the adjoint representation of a Chevalley group, {\em J. Algebra}, vol. 127). In this paper we give an explicit description of the relatively universal embedding of $A_{n,\{1,n\}}(\mathbb{K})$ which covers the natural one. In particular, we prove that this relatively universal embedding has (vector) dimension equal to $\mathfrak{d}+n^2+2n$ where $\mathfrak{d}$ is the transcendence degree of $\mathbb{K}$ over its minimal subfield (if $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{K}) = 0$) or the generating rank of $\mathbb{K}$ over ${\mathbb K}^p$ (if $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{K}) = p > 0$). Accordingly, both the "if" and the "only if" part of Smith-Völklein's result hold true for every $n \geq 2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine the minimal spectral radii among all skew-reciprocal integer matrices of a fixed even dimension that are primitive or nonnegative and irreducible. In particular, except for dimension six, we show that each such class of matrices realises smaller spectral radii than the corresponding reciprocal class.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kaiji Kondo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the present paper, we study the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local fields from the point of view of anabelian geometry. In particular, we show that, under certain mild assumptions, the image of the natural homomorphism from the automorphism group of a mixed-characteristic local field to the outer automorphism group of the associated absolute Galois group is not a normal subgroup. Furthermore, we show that, for the absolute Galois group of a mixed-characteristic local field satisfying certain assumptions, there exist a continuous representation and a continuous automorphism of the group such that the former is irreducible, abelian, and crystalline, but the continuous representation obtained as the composite of the former with the latter is not even Hodge-Tate. These results significantly generalize previous works by Hoshi and Nishio. A key observation in obtaining these results is to focus on the analogy between the mapping class groups of topological surfaces and the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local fields. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first work applying results from the theory of mapping class groups to the anabelian geometry of mixed-characteristic local fields, going beyond a mere analogy between the two.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Emre Sen &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** v2. New results added: endomorphism algebras of convex subcategories, d-representation finite higher Nakayama algebras. References updated. Comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the derived category of mod-KQ for Dynkin quiver Q, we construct a full subcategory in a canonical way, so that its endomorphism algebra is a higher Auslander algebra of global dimension $3k+2$ for any $k\geq 1$. Furthermore, we extend this construction for higher analogues of representation finite and hereditary algebras. Specifically, if $M$ is an n-cluster tilting object in the bounded derived category of n-representation finite and n-hereditary algebra, then we construct a full subcategory in a canonical way, so that its endomorphism algebra is a higher Auslander algebra of global dimension $(n+2)k+n+1$ for any $k\geq 1$. As an application, we revisit the higher Auslander correspondence. Firstly, we describe the corresponding module categories that have higher cluster-tilting objects, and then we discuss their relationship with certain full subcategories of the derived category. Consequently, we obtain a vast list of n-representation finite n-hereditary algebras whose n-cluster tilting objects are always minimal generator-cogenerator. Moreover, resulting algebras can be realized as endomorphism algebras of certain full subcategories of (higher) cluster categories.</p></details>
