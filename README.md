<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We resolve a $1000 Erdős prize problem, complete with formal verification generated by a large language model. In over a dozen papers, beginning in 1976 and spanning two decades, Paul Erdős repeatedly posed one of his "favourite" conjectures: every finite Sidon set can be extended to a finite perfect difference set. We establish that {1, 2, 4, 8, 13} is a counterexample to this conjecture. During the preparation of this paper, we discovered that although this problem was presumed to be open for half a century, Marshall Hall, Jr. published a different counterexample three decades before Erdős first posed the problem. With a healthy skepticism of this apparent oversight, and out of an abundance of caution, we used ChatGPT to vibe code a Lean proof of both Hall's and our counterexamples.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an algebraically closed field K, let G be a finite abelian group of K-linear automorphisms of a finite-dimensional algebra A and AG is the associated skew group algebra. The author with S. Trepode and A. G. Chaio introduced the notion of a Galois semi-covering functor to study the irreducible morphisms over skew group algebras. In this paper, we establish a Galois semi-covering functor between the morphism categories as well as the functor categories over the algebras A and AG and prove that their Krull-Gabriel dimension are equal. This computation confirms Prests conjecture on the finiteness of Krull-Gabriel dimension and Schroers conjecture on its connection with the stable rank (the least stabilized radical power) over skew gentle algebras. Moreover, we determine all posible stable ranks for (skew) Brauer graph algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a locally compact abelian group with Haar measure $μ$. For integers $n \geq 2$ and $H \geq 2$ and for any $n$-tuples $\mathbf{u}_1,\ldots, \mathbf{u}_H \in \mathbf{N}^n$, there exist measurable subsets $A_1,\ldots, A_n$ of $G$ such that the $n$-tuple $\left( μ(hA_1),\ldots, μ(hA_n) \right)$ has the same relative order as the $n$-tuple $\mathbf{u}_h$ for all $h = 1,\ldots, H$. For integers $m_{i,h}$ for $i =1,\ldots, n-1$ and $h = 1,\ldots, H$, there are Lebesgue measurable sets $A_1,\ldots, A_n$ in $\mathbf{R}$ such that $μ(hA_{i+1}) - μ(hA_i) = m_{i,h}$ for all $i$ and $h$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the problem of determining which integer polynomials divide Newman polynomials. In this vein, we first give results concerning the $8438$ known polynomials with Mahler measure less than $1.3$. We then exhibit a list of polynomials that divide no Newman polynomial. In particular, we show that a degree-10 polynomial of Mahler measure \text{approximately} 1.419404632 divides no Newman polynomial, thereby improving the best known upper bound for any universal constant $σ$, if it exists, such that every integer polynomial of Mahler measure less than $σ$ divides a Newman polynomial. Finally, letting $l(x)$ denote Lehmer's polynomial, we explicitly construct Newman polynomials divisible by $l(x)^2$ with degrees up to $150$, and show that no Newman polynomial is divisible by $l(x)^3$ up to degree $160$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11376v1'>2601.11376</a>\]&nbsp; **From ABC to Effective Roth and Ridout Constants for Cubic Roots**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Karsten Müller, Michael Taktikos &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Enrico Bombieri showed conditionally (1994) that the ABC conjecture implies Roth's theorem, and Van Frankenhuysen (1999) later provided a complete proof. Building on Bombieri's and Van der Poorten's explicit formula for continued-fraction coefficients of algebraic numbers (specialized to cubic roots) we derive an effective bound for a Roth-type constant assuming an effective form of ABC. Roth's original argument establishes existence but does not yield an explicit value; our approach makes the dependence on the ABC parameters explicit and also gives an explicit bound in the corresponding special case of Ridout's theorem. We then introduce the notion of approximation gain as a refinement of the quality of an abc-triple. For c in a large computational range, the approximation gain remains below a strikingly small threshold, motivating the conjecture that the approximation gain is always smaller than 1.5. This suggests a potential strategy for attacking ABC by bounding approximation gain and power gain separately.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 31 pages, 2 figures, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use composition of binary quadratic forms to systematically create pairs of Seifert surfaces that are non-isotopic in the four-ball. Our main topological result employs Gauss composition to classify the pairs of binary quadratic forms that arise as the Seifert forms of pairs of disjoint Seifert surfaces of genus one. The main ingredient of the proof is number-theoretic and of independent interest. It establishes a new connection between the Bhargava cube and the geometric approach to Gauss composition via planes in the space of two-by-two matrices. In particular, we obtain a geometric recipe that given any two binary quadratic forms finds a Bhargava cube that gives rise to their composition.</p></details>

As an example of our method, over $\mathbb{Q}$, we prove that there exist infinitely many non-isomorphic hyperelliptic curves of genus two, whose Jacobians have rank equal to a fixed number between $1$ and $11$, genus three and four curves with rank between $1$ and $4$, and genus five and six with rank between $1$ and $3$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11304v1'>2601.11304</a>\]&nbsp; **On the Landen formula for multiple polylogarithms and its $\ell$-adic Galois analogue**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Densuke Shiraishi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 24 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the present paper, we provide an algebraic and geometric proof of the Landen formula for complex multiple polylogarithms originally established by Okuda and Ueno. Our approach employs a chain rule of complex KZ solutions arising from the symmetry $z \mapsto \frac{z}{z-1}$ of $\mathbb{P}^1 \backslash \{0,1,\infty\}$. Furthermore, by replacing complex KZ solutions with $\ell$-adic Galois 1-cocycles in this proof, we obtain the Landen formula for $\ell$-adic Galois multiple polylogarithms. This formula involves lower weight terms specific to the $\ell$-adic Galois setting, which originate from the higher-order terms of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff sum ${\rm log}({\rm exp}(-e_1){\rm exp}(-e_0))$. These lower weight terms are explicitly described by an integral involving Goldberg polynomials.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Daniel Barrera Salazar, Mladen Dimitrov, Chris Williams &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 69 pages (inc. glossary of notation). Accepted version, now published in Advances in Mathematics

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we propose and explore a new connection in the study of $p$-adic $L$-functions and eigenvarieties. We use it to prove results on the geometry of the cuspidal eigenvariety for $\mathrm{GL}_{2n}$ over a totally real number field $F$ at classical points admitting Shalika models. We also construct $p$-adic $L$-functions over the eigenvariety around these points. Our proofs proceed in the opposite direction to established methods: rather than using the geometry of eigenvarieties to deduce results about $p$-adic $L$-functions, we instead show that non-vanishing of a (standard) $p$-adic $L$-function implies smoothness of the eigenvariety at such points. Key to our methods are a family of distribution-valued functionals on (parahoric) overconvergent cohomology groups, which we construct via $p$-adic interpolation of classical representation-theoretic branching laws for $\mathrm{GL}_n \times \mathrm{GL}_n \subset \mathrm{GL}_{2n}$. More precisely, we use our functionals to attach a $p$-adic $L$-function to a non-critical refinement $\tildeπ$ of a regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic representation $π$ of $\mathrm{GL}_{2n}/F$ which is spherical at $p$ and admits a Shalika model. Our new parahoric distribution coefficients allow us to obtain optimal non-critical slope and growth bounds for this construction. When $π$ has regular weight and the corresponding $p$-adic Galois representation is irreducible, we exploit non-vanishing of our functionals to show that the parabolic eigenvariety for $\mathrm{GL}_{2n}/F$ is étale at $\tildeπ$ over an $([F:\mathbb{Q}]+1)$-dimensional weight space and contains a dense set of classical points admitting Shalika models. Under a hypothesis on the local Shalika models at bad places which is empty for $π$ of level 1, we construct a $p$-adic $L$-function for the family.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This version contains only the required elements to prove the generic entailment. The rest of the previous version's content is superseded by our paper "Theta operators on Hodge type Shimura varieties"

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a new family of mod $p$ weight shifting differential operators on the Siegel threefold. In particular, we construct one operator which generalizes the classical theta cycle, whose weight shift allows for maps between $p$-restricted weights, and which is generically injective on global sections. As an application we produce a generic entailment of Serre weights, i.e. any Hecke eigenform which is modular for a generic Serre weight in the lowest alcove is also modular for a Serre weight in one of the upper alcoves. The entailed Serre weight corresponds to a shadow weight of the lowest alcove Serre weight, in Herzig's conjectural description of $W(\overlineρ)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we consider the construction of irreducible representations of finite pattern groups in terms of Panov's associative polarization, which is a finite-field analogue of Kirillov's orbital method. Using this construction, first, we are able to classify the irreducible representations of the unipotent radical of the standard parabolic subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}_n$ with 4 parts; second, we can parameterize irreducible characters of degree $q$ in terms of coadjoint orbits of cardinality $q^2$, for any finite pattern groups $G$ over $\mathbb{F}_q,$ where $\mathbb{F}_q$ is a finite field with $q$ elements.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Martin Ortiz &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Most of the contents are part of the author's PhD thesis. Comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose the use of de Rham cohomology of special fibers of Shimura varieties to formulate a geometric version of the weight part of Serre's conjecture. We conjecture that this formulation is equivalent to the one using Serre weights and the étale cohomology of Shimura varieties. We prove this equivalence for generic weights and generic non-Eisenstein eigensystems for a compact $U(2,1)$ Shimura variety such that $G_{\mathbb{Q}_p}=GL_3$. We do this by proving a generic concentration in middle degree of mod $p$ de Rham cohomology with coefficients. In turn, we prove this generic concentration by constructing generalized mod $p$ BGG decompositions for de Rham cohomology. After applying the results from our companion paper, this reduces to computing some BGG-like resolutions in a certain mod $p$ version of category $\mathcal{O}$, which is the main content of the article. In the $GSp_4$ case we also compute some explicit BGG decompositions, and assuming the generic concentration in middle degree of de Rham cohomology we obtain an improvement on the main result of arxiv:2410.09602.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Based on the author's PhD thesis. It supersedes parts of arXiv:2410.09602v1

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a new family of mod $p$ weight shifting differential operators on Hodge type Shimura varieties at hyperspecial level. First we construct basic theta operators, labelled by positive roots, that generalize Katz's theta operator for modular forms. Secondly we construct theta linkage maps, these are operators between automorphic vector bundles with linked weights, which can be thought of as generalizations of the classical theta cycle of Tate--Jochnowitz. In particular, there exist such maps within the $p$-restricted region, whose weight shifts are directly related to the conjectures of Herzig on the weight part of Serre's conjecture. We explain the relation between the two operators, and we prove some properties about them, e.g., the injectivity of some of them in a generic locus of the $p$-restricted region. As an application, we produce an example of a generic entailment of Serre weights for the groups $GL_{4,\mathbb{Q}_p}$ and $U(4)_{\mathbb{Q}_p}$, by combining the method of arxiv:2410.09602 with our stronger results about theta operators.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 10 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We revisit the problem of rigorously and deterministically finding elements of large order in the multiplicative group of integers modulo a natural number $N$. Solving this problem is an essential step in several recent deterministic algorithms for factoring $N$, including the currently fastest ones. In 2018, the second author gave an algorithm that for a given target order $D \geq N^{2/5}$, finds either an element of order exceeding $D$, or a nontrivial divisor of $N$, or proves that $N$ is prime. The running time was $$ O\left(\frac{D^{1/2}}{(\log \log D)^{1/2}} \log^2 N \right) $$ bit operations, asymptotically the same as the cost of computing the order of a single element using Sutherland's optimisation of the classical babystep-giantstep method. Subsequent work by several authors weakened the hypothesis $D \geq N^{2/5}$ to $D \geq N^{1/6}$. In this paper, we show that the hypothesis may be dropped altogether. Moreover, if $N$ is prime, we can guarantee returning an element of order exceeding $D$, rather than a proof that $N$ is prime.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent paper, we proved that for any large enough odd modulus $q\in \mathbb{N}$ and fixed $α_2\in \mathbb{N}$ coprime to $q$, the congruence $$ x_1^2+α_2x_2^2+α_3x_3^2\equiv 0 \bmod{q} $$ has a solution of $(x_1,x_2,x_3)\in \mathbb{Z}^3$ with $x_3$ coprime to $q$ of height $\max\{|x_1|,|x_2|,|x_3|\}\le q^{11/24+\varepsilon}$ for, in a sense, almost all $α_3$, where $α_3$ runs over the reduced residue classes modulo $q$. Here it was of significance that $11/24<1/2$, so we broke a natural barrier. In this paper, we average the moduli $q$ in addition, establishing the existence of a solution of height $\le Q^{3/8+\varepsilon}α_2^{\varepsilon}$ for almost all pairs $(q,α_3)$, with $Q$ large enough, $Q<q\le 2Q$, $q$ coprime to $2α_2$ and $α_3$ running over the reduced residue classes modulo $q$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define tensor categories ${\sf Ver}_{p^n}(G)$ in characteristic $p$ for connected reductive groups $G$ and positive integers $n$, generalising the semisimple Verlinde categories ${\sf Ver}_p(G)$ originating from Gelfand-Kazhdan and the higher Verlinde categories ${\sf Ver}_{p^n}$ for ${\rm SL}_2$ defined by Benson-Etingof-Ostrik. The construction is based on the definition of ${\sf Ver}_{p^n}$ as an abelian envelope of a quotient of a category of tilting modules, but we also introduce an expanded construction which refines the ${\rm SL}_2$ case and gives new results. In particular, the union ${\sf Ver}_{p^\infty}(G)$ can be derived from the perfection of $G$; certain exact sequences in ${\sf Rep}G$ map to exact sequences in ${\sf Ver}_{p^n}(G)$; and the underlying abelian category of ${\sf Ver}_{p^n}$ can be expressed as a subcategory of ${\sf Rep}{\rm SL}_2$, or as a Serre quotient of a subcategory of ${\sf Rep}{\rm SL}_2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For nonempty subsets $X$ and $Y$ of a group $G$, we say that $(X,Y)$ is a tiling of $G$ if every element of $G$ can be uniquely expressed as $xy$ for some $x\in X$ and $y\in Y$. In 1966, Rothaus and Thompson studied whether the symmetric group $S_n$ with $n\geq3$ admits a tiling $(T_n,Y)$, where $T_n$ consists of the identity and all the transpositions in $S_n$. They showed that no such tiling exists if $1+n(n-1)/2$ is divisible by a prime number at least $\sqrt{n}+2$. In this paper, we establish a new necessary condition for the existence of such a tiling: the subset $Y$ must be partition-transitive with respect to certain partitions of $n$. This generalizes the result of Rothaus and Thompson, as well as a result of Nomura in 1985. We also study whether $S_n$ can be tiled by the set $T_n^*$ of all the transpositions, which finally leads us to conjecture that neither $T_n$ nor $T_n^*$ tiles $S_n$ for any $n\geq4$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove certain polynomial relations between the values of complex irreducible characters of general finite symmetric groups. We use it to find some sets of conjugacy classes such that no finite symmetric group has a complex irreducible character that vanishes at every class in the set. In particular, we show that if $n$ satisfies certain conditions, then $S_n\setminus \{1\}$ cannot be covered by the set of zeros of three irreducible characters. We also prove that the values of character of $2$-defect zero can be expressed as rational functions in $n$, and build a recursive algorithm to find these rational functions. As another application, we improve a result by A. Miller on identification of irreducible characters by checking small number of values.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study left-translation invariant algebraic $D$-modules on complex affine algebraic groups. Using the standard description of these objects as left-invariant flat algebraic connections on the trivial vector bundle, modulo algebraic gauge transformations, we recast the classification problem as an explicit moduli problem for constant connections. Our main results treat the semisimple case and the general linear case. For a connected semisimple complex algebraic group $G$, we show that invariant $D$-modules of rank $n$ are determined by the finite central kernel of the simply connected cover of $G$: equivalently, their isomorphism classes are classified by $n$-dimensional complex representations of that finite group, up to conjugacy. For a general linear group, we prove that every invariant $D$-module of rank $n$ is obtained by pullback along the determinant map from the one-dimensional torus, so the classification reduces completely to the torus case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper describes the vector bundle on the elliptic modular curve that is associated to a vertex operator algebra $V$ (VOA) or more generally a quasi-vertex operator algebra (QVOA), with a view towards future applications aimed at studying the characters of VOAs. We explain how the modes of sections of $V$ give rise naturally to $V$-valued quasi-modular forms. The space $Q(V)$ of $V$-valued quasi-modular forms is endowed with the structure of a doubled QVOA, and in particular the algebra $Q$ of quasi-modular forms is itself a doubled QVOA. $Q(V)$ also admits a natural derivative operator arising from the connection on the bundle defined by $V$ and the modular derivative, which we call the raising operator. We introduce an associated lowering operator $Λ$ on $Q(V)$ having the property that the $V$-valued modular forms $M(V)\subseteq Q(V)$ are the kernel of $Λ$. This extends the classical theory of scalar-valued quasi-modular forms. We exhibit an explicit isomorphism of $M(V)$ with $M \otimes V$. Finally, the coordinate invariance of vertex operators implies that $M(V)$ has a natural Hecke theory, and we use this isomorphism to fully describe the Hecke eigensystems: they are the same as the systems of eigenvalues that arise from scalar-valued quasi-modular forms.</p></details>

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the Bruhat--Tits building of $\mathrm{PGL}_{3}(F)$ for a non-archimedean local field $F$ with residue field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. For the standard arithmetic quotient $Γ\backslash\mathcal{B}$ with $Γ=\mathrm{PGL}_{3}(\mathbb{F}_{q}[t])$, we prove an Ihara--Bass type \emph{determinant formula} expressing the chamber zeta function as the reciprocal of a characteristic polynomial of a naturally defined chamber transfer operator. In particular, the chamber zeta function is \emph{rational} in its complex parameter. As an application of the determinant formula, we obtain explicit counting results for closed gallery classes arising from tailless galleries in $\mathcal{B}$, including exact identities and spectral asymptotics governed by the chamber operator.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a writeup of a resolution of Erdős Problem #728; this is the first Erdős problem (a problem proposed by Paul Erdős which has been collected in the Erdős Problems website) regarded as fully resolved autonomously by an AI system. The system in question is a combination of GPT-5.2 Pro by OpenAI and Aristotle by Harmonic, operated by Kevin Barreto. The final result of the system is a formal proof written in Lean, which we translate to informal mathematics in the present writeup for wider accessibility. The proved result is as follows. We show a logarithmic-gap phenomenon regarding factorial divisibility: For any constants $0<C_1<C_2$ and $0 < \varepsilon < 1/2$ there exist infinitely many triples $(a,b,n)\in\mathbb N^3$ with $\varepsilon n \le a,b \le (1-\varepsilon)n$ such that $$ a!\,b!\mid n!\,(a+b-n)!\qquad\text{and}\qquad C_1\log n < a+b-n < C_2\log n. $$ The argument reduces this to a binomial divisibility $\binom{m+k}{k}\mid\binom{2m}{m}$ and studies it prime-by-prime. By Kummer's theorem, $ν_p\binom{2m}{m}$ translates into a carry count for doubling $m$ in base $p$. We then employ a counting argument to find, in each scale $[M,2M]$, an integer $m$ whose base-$p$ expansions simultaneously force many carries when doubling $m$, for every prime $p\le 2k$, while avoiding the rare event that one of $m+1,\dots,m+k$ is divisible by an unusually high power of $p$. These "carry-rich but spike-free" choices of $m$ force the needed $p$-adic inequalities and the divisibility. The overall strategy is similar to results regarding divisors of $\binom{2n}{n}$ studied earlier by Erdős and by Pomerance.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a Schur--Horn type inequality for symmetric hyperbolic polynomials. As an immediate consequence, we resolve a conjecture of Nam Q. Le on Hadamard-type inequalities for hyperbolic polynomials. Our argument is based on the Schur--Horn theorem, the Birkhoff theorem, and Gårding's concavity theorem for hyperbolicity cones. Beyond the eigenvalue level, we develop a symmetrization principle on hyperbolicity cones: if a hyperbolic polynomial is invariant under a finite group action, then its value increases under the associated Reynolds operator (group averaging). Applied to the sign-flip symmetries of linear principal minor polynomials introduced by Blekherman et al., this yields a short proof of the hyperbolic Fischer--Hadamard inequalities for PSD-stable lpm polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A famous conjecture of Erd\H os and Straus is that for every integer $n\ge2$, $4/n$ can be represented as $1/x+1/y+1/z$, where $x,y,z$ are positive integers. This conjecture was generalized to $5/n$ by Sierpiński, and then Schinzel conjectured that for every integer $m\ge4$ there is a bound $n_m$ such that the fraction $m/n$ is the sum of 3 unit fractions for all integers $n\ge n_m$. Leveraging and generalizing work of Elsholtz and Tao, we show that if $n_m$ exists it must be at least $\exp(m^{1/3+o(1)})$; that is, there are numbers $n$ this large for which $m/n$ is not the sum of 3 unit fractions. We prove a weaker, but numerically explicit version of this theorem, showing that for $m\ge 6.52\times10^9$ there is a prime $p\in(m^2,2m^2)$ with $m/p$ not the sum of 3 unit fractions, and report on some extensive numerical calculations that support this assertion with the much smaller bound $m\ge20$. A result of Vaughan is that for each $m$, most $n$'s have $m/n$ representable; we make the dependence on $m$ in this result explicit. In addition, we prove a result generalizing the problem to the sum of $j$ unit fractions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbb Q$ be an elliptic curve and for each prime $p$, let $N_p$ denote the number of points of $E$ modulo $p$. The original version of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture asserts that $\prod \limits _{p \leq x} \frac{N_p}{p} \sim C (\log x) ^{\text{rank}(E(\mathbb Q))}$ as $x \to \infty$. Goldfeld (1982) showed that this conjecture implies both the Riemann Hypothesis for $L(E, s)$ and the modern formulation of the conjecture i.e. that $\text{ord}_{s=1} L(E, s)= \text{rank}(E(\mathbb Q))$. In this paper, we prove that if we let $r=\text{ord} _{s=1}L(E, s)$, then under the assumption of the Riemann Hypothesis for $L(E, s)$, we have that $\prod \limits _{p \leq x} \frac{N_p}{p} \sim C (\log x)^r$ for all $x$ outside a set of finite logarithmic measure. As corollaries, we recover not only Goldfeld's result, but we also prove a result in the direction of the converse. Our method of proof is based on establishing the asymptotic behaviour of partial Euler products of $L(E, s)$ in the right-half of the critical strip.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we generalize the following problem, which is called the rational angle bisection problem, to the $n$-dimensional space $k^n$ over a subfield $k$ of $\mathbb R$: in the coordinate plane, for which rational numbers $a$ and $b$ are the slopes of the angle bisectors between two lines with slopes $a$ and $b$ rational? First, we give a few characterizations of when the angle bisectors between two lines with direction vectors in $k^n$ have direction vectors in $k^n.$ To find solutions to the problem in the case when $k = \mathbb Q,$ we also give a formula for the integral solutions of $x_1{}^2+\dots +x_n{}^2 = dx_{n+1}{}^2,$ which is a generalization of the negative Pell's equation $x^2-dy^2 = -1,$ where $d$ is a square-free positive integer. Second, by applying the above characterizations, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the incenter of a given $n$-simplex with $k$-rational vertices to be $k$-rational. In the coordinate plane, we prove that every triangle with $k$-rational vertices and incenter can be obtained by scaling a triangle with $k$-rational side lengths and area, which is a generalization of a Heronian triangle. We also state certain fundamental properties of a few centers of a given triangle with $k$-rational vertices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras $\mathcal{A}$ associated with unpunctured surfaces $\tilde{\mathbf{S}}$ endowed with an orientation-preserving involution $σ$. We give a geometric realization of such cluster algebras by showing that cluster variables of $\mathcal{A}$ correspond to $σ$-orbits of arcs of $\tilde{\mathbf{S}}$, while clusters are given by admissible $σ$-invariant triangulations. We establish a ring homomorphism from $\mathcal{A}$ to a skew-symmetric cluster algebra of the same rank, which is combinatorially derived from $\mathcal{A}$. We use this result to provide a cluster expansion formula for any $σ$-orbit $[γ]$ in terms of perfect matchings of some labeled modified snake graphs constructed from the arcs of $[γ]$. Then, we associate a symmetric finite-dimensional algebra $A$ to any seed of $\mathcal{A}$, such that non-initial cluster variables bijectively correspond to orthogonal indecomposable $A$-modules. Finally, we exhibit a purely representation-theoretic map from the category of orthogonal $A$-modules to $\mathcal{A}$, providing a Caldero-Chapoton map in this setting.</p></details>

The Wiener-Wintner theorem along the primes is an immediate corollary. Our proof lives at the interface of classical Fourier analysis, combinatorial number theory, higher order Fourier analysis, and pointwise ergodic theory, with $U^3$ theory playing an important role; our $U^3$-estimates for \emph{Heath-Brown} models of the von Mangoldt function may be of independent interest.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish explicit unconditional results on the graphic properties of the prime gap sequence. Let $p_n$ denote the $n$-th prime number (with $p_0=1$) and $\mathrm{PD}_n = (p_\ell - p_{\ell-1})_{\ell=1}^n$ be the sequence of the first $n$ prime gaps. Building upon the recent work by Erdős \emph{et al}, which proved the graphic nature of $\mathrm{PD}_n$ for large $n$ unconditionally, and for all $n$ under RH, we provide the first explicit unconditional threshold such that: (1) For all $n \geq \exp\exp(30.5)$, $\mathrm{PD}_n$ is graphic. (2) For all $n \geq \exp\exp(34.5)$, every realization $G_n$ of $\mathrm{PD}_n$ satisfies that $(G_n, p_{n+1}-p_n)$ is DPG-graphic. Our proofs utilize a more refined criterion for when a sequence is graphic, and better estimates for the first moment of large prime gaps proven through an explicit zero-free region and explicit zero-density estimate for the Riemann zeta function.</p></details>

Our approach is different from others in the literature in that there is no non-modularity assumption. We prove, when the field is algebraically closed, the analogue of the Main Theorem of the representation theory of Galois orders by V. Futorny and S. Ovsienko. Then we develop a theory of infinite rank generalized Weyl algebras, which was never explicitly introduced in the literature before, and prove its basic properties. We expect their representation theory to be of interest for future works. Finally we show that under very mild assumptions, the invariants of generalized Weyl algebras under the action of non-exceptional irreducible complex reflection groups are a principal Galois orders, greatly generalizing, in an elementary fashion, results obtained previously for the Weyl algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2010, Sarnak initiated the study of the dynamics of the system determined by the square of the Möbius function (the characteristic function of the square-free integers). We deal with his program in the more general context of $\mathfrak{B}$-free integers in number fields, suggested 5 years later by Baake and Huck. This setting encompasses the classical square-free case and its generalizations. Given a number field $K$, let $\mathfrak{B}$ be a family of pairwise coprime ideals in its ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$, such that $\sum_{\mathfrak{b}\in\mathfrak{B}}1/|\mathcal{O}_K / \mathfrak{b}|<\infty$. We study the dynamical system determined by the set $\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}=\mathcal{O}_K\setminus \bigcup_{\mathfrak{b}\in\mathfrak{B}}\mathfrak{b}$ of $\mathfrak{B}$-free integers in $\mathcal{O}_K$. We show that the characteristic function $\mathbb{1}_{\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}}$ of $\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}$ is generic along the natural Følner sequence for a probability measure on $\{0,1\}^{\mathcal{O}_K}$, invariant under the multidimensional shift. The corresponding measure-theoretical dynamical system is proved to be isomorphic to an ergodic rotation on a compact Abelian group. In particular, it is of zero Kolmogorov entropy. Moreover, we provide a description of ``patterns'' appearing in $\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}$ and compute the topological entropy of the orbit closure of $\mathbb{1}_{\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}}$. Finally, we show that this topological dynamical system has a non-trivial topological joining with an ergodic rotation on a compact Abelian group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be an odd prime. For a compact Lie group $G$ and an elementary abelian $p$-group $A$ of $G$, one may define the Weyl group $W_A$ of $A$ in a similar fashion as defining the Weyl group of a maximal torus, such that $W_A$ acts on $H^*(BA;R)$ for any coefficient ring $R$, and the image of the restriction $H^*(BG;R)\to H^*(BA;R)$ lies in $H^*(BA;R)^{W_A}$, the sub-algebra of $H^*(BA:R)$ of $W_A$-invariant elements. In this paper, we consider the projective unitary group $PU(p^m)$ and one of its maximal elementary abelian $p$-subgroup $A_m$, of which the Weyl group is isomorphic to $Sp_{2m}(\mathbb{F}_p)$. Then the theory of $Sp_{2m}(\mathbb{F}_p)$-invariant polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_p$ may be applied to study the cohomology of $BPU(p^m)$, the classifying space of $PU(p^m)$. Following a theorem by Quillen, we deduce several theorems on $H^*(BPU(p^m);\mathbb{F}_p)$ modulo the nilradical from results on invariant polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A set $\mathcal S\subset \mathbb N$ is said to be a subset-sum-distinct or dissociated if all of its finite subsets have different sums. Alternately, an equivalent classification is if any equality of the form $$\sum_{s\in \mathcal S} \varepsilon_s \cdot s =0$$ where $\varepsilon_s \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ implies that all the $\varepsilon_s$'s are $0$. For a dissociated set $\mathcal S$, we prove that for $c_\ast = \frac 12 \log_2 \left(\frac π2\right)$ and any $c_\ast-1<C<c_\ast$, we have $$\mathcal S(n) \,:=\, \mathcal S\cap [1,n] \,\le\, \log_2 n +\frac 12 \log_2\log_2 n + C$$ for all $n\in \mathcal N_C$ with asymptotic density $\mathbf d\left(\mathcal N_C\right)=2-2^{c_\ast-C}$. Further, we consider the greedy algorithm for generating these sets and prove that this algorithm always eventually doubles. Finally, we also consider some generalizations of dissociated sets and prove similar results about them.</p></details>

We classify such varieties over any perfect field. In particular, we prove that $V_{22}$-varieties of Mukai-Umemura type over $k$ exist if and only if $\mathrm{char}\ k \neq 2$, $5$. We also prove the same result for $\mathbb{G}_a$-type. As arithmetic applications, we show that the Shafarevich conjecture holds for $V_{22}$-varieties of Mukai-Umemura type and of $\mathbb{G}_m$-type, while it fails for $V_{22}$-varieties of $\mathbb{G}_a$-type. Moreover, we prove that there exists $V_{22}$-varieties over $\mathbb{Z}$, whereas there do not exist $V_{22}$-varieties over $\mathbb{Z}$ whose generic fiber has a positive-dimensional automorphism group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we obtain several results related to the $p$-adic interpolation of the classical Cogdell lift, mapping special cycles on Picard modular surfaces to elliptic modular forms. The results have a three-fold nature: in the first part of the paper, we $p$-adically interpolate the adjoint Kudla lift, exploiting the previously constructed $Λ$-adic Kudla lift. In the second part, we construct higher weight cycles in Kuga-Sato varieties attached to Picard modular surfaces, and show modularity of the generating series of these cycles, thus obtaining a higher weight analogue of the Cogdell lift. Finally, we apply the formalism introduced by Loeffler to construct $p$-adic analytic cohomology classes of special cycles, whose generating series is proved to be a Hida family interpolating the Cogdell lifts in the weight and level variables.</p></details>

This gives an effective version of equidistribution results of Ratner and Shah with a polynomial rate. The key new phenomenon is the existence of many intermediate groups between the $\mathrm{SL}_2$ containing our unipotent and the ambient group, which introduces potential local and global obstruction to equidistribution. Our approach relies on a Bourgain-type projection theorem in the presence of obstructions, together with a careful analysis of these obstructions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Adinkras are highly structured graphs developed to study 1-dimensional supersymmetry algebras. A cyclic ordering of the edge colors of an Adinkra, or rainbow, determines a Riemann surface and a height function on the vertices of the Adinkra determines a divisor on this surface. We study the induced map from height functions to divisors on the Jacobian of the Riemann surface. In the first nontrivial case, a 5-dimensional hypercube corresponding to a Jacobian given by a product of 5 elliptic curves each with $j$-invariant 2048, we develop and characterize a purely combinatorial algorithm to compute height function images. We show that when restricted to a single elliptic curve, every height function is a multiple of a specified generating divisor, and raising and lowering vertices corresponds to adding or subtracting this generator. We also give strict bounds on the coefficients of this generator that appear in the collection of all divisors of height functions.</p></details>

Inspired by it, we introduce the notion of a Kostant cuspidal permutation as a minimal Kostant negative consecutive pattern. It is shown that Kostant cuspidality is an invariant of a Kazhdan-Lusztig left cell. We describe four infinite families of Kostant cuspidal involutions, including a complete classification of Kostant cuspidal fully commutative involutions. In particular, we show that the number of new Kostant cuspidal elements can be arbitrarily large, when the rank grows. This provides some potential explanation why Kostant's problem is hard.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 43 pages. Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove universality for cokernels of random integral matrices with symmetries via an approach different from the classical surjection moment method introduced by Wood (arXiv:1402.5149). In the symmetric case, we reprove Hodges' universality theorem (arXiv:2311.07078), i.e. the version incorporating the canonical pairing from Wood's setting, and in the alternating case we reprove the local universality theorem of Nguyen-Wood (arXiv:2210.08526). A key advantage of our method is that it is quantitative: we obtain explicit error bounds, which are exponentially small in most regimes, thereby addressing Wood's question on effective convergence rates. Our argument is inspired by Maples' exposure-process and coupling viewpoint (arXiv:1301.1239) and uses a generalized form of Fourier-analytic estimates in the exponentially sharp style of Ferber-Jain-Sah-Sawhney (arXiv:2106.04049).</p></details>

> **Comment:** 9 pages, revised based on referee comments

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The well-known Van Lint--MacWilliams' conjecture states that if $q$ is an odd prime power, and $A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ such that $0,1 \in A$, $|A|=q$, and $a-b$ is a square for each $a,b \in A$, then $A$ must be the subfield $\mathbb{F}_q$. This conjecture was first proved by Blokhuis and is often phrased in terms of the maximum cliques in Paley graphs of square order. Previously, Asgarli and the author extended Blokhuis' theorem to a larger family of Cayley graphs. In this paper, we give a new simple proof of Blokhuis' theorem and its extensions. More generally, we show that if $S \subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}^*$ has small multiplicative doubling, and $A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ with $0,1 \in A$, $|A|=q$, such that $A-A \subseteq S \cup \{0\}$, then $A=\mathbb{F}_q$. This new result refines and extends several previous works; moreover, our new approach avoids using heavy machinery from number theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce integer sequences satisfying new congruence properties inspired by the Euler and Gauss congruences, which we call Euler-Gauss sequences. Noting that every Gauss sequence is an Euler-Gauss sequence, we compare them with certain generalisations of Gauss sequences and provide several counterexamples. Unlike the Gauss sequences, this extended class also contains sequences based on distinct prime factors. In particular, the sequences Smallest Prime Factor (SPF) and Greatest Prime Factor (GPF) sequences (suitably defined at 1), extensively studied by prominent mathematicians such as Erdos and Alladi, arise as examples of this class of Euler-Gauss sequences and not in the class of Gauss sequences. In the latter part of the paper, we obtain q-analogs of the defined Euler-Gauss sequences and establish characteristic properties that reveal their structure and fill gaps in the literature on q-Gauss sequences. In recent works, q-Gauss sequences have been shown to admit interesting combinatorial interpretations and to exhibit the Cyclic Sieving Phenomenon (CSP). Not only do our q-Euler-Gauss sequences satisfy the standard CSP with some restriction, but we also derive a new CSP condition for the SPF and GPF sequences, not hitherto known in the literature.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $x\ge y>0$ be integers. A positive integer is $y$-smooth if all its prime divisors are at most $y$. Let $Ψ(x,y)$ count the number of $y$-smooth integers up to $x$. We present several algorithms that will generate an integer $n\le x$ at random, with known prime factorization, such that $n$ is $y$-smooth. We begin by describing algorithms to compute $Ψ(x,y)$ exactly and to enumerate $y$-smooth integers up to $x$ in lexicographic order by prime divisor. Both of these are based on Buchstab's identity, and were likely known before. Then we present an algorithm that accepts as input a parameter $r$, $0\le r<1$, and returns the integer $n$ that is at position $\lfloor rΨ(x,y)\rfloor$ in the lexicographic ordering of all $y$-smooth integers up to $x$. Here position 0 is the first position. Thus, $n$ is generated uniformly so long as $r$ is chosen uniformly. This algorithm has a running time of $O(Ψ(x,y)\log\log y)$ arithmetic operations. We then explore the tradeoff between speed and rigor. By relaxing the uniformity of the output and allowing for multiple heuristics in our runtime analysis, we improve the running time to $$ O\left( \frac{ (\log x)^3 }{\log\log x} \right)$$ arithmetic operations. We conclude with a sample run by generating a $10000$-smooth integer $\le 10^{100}$.</p></details>

Using this, we provide various group theoretic criteria for the non-vanishing of $\mathrm{HH}^1(B,B)$. In particular, we show $\mathrm{HH}^1(B,B)\neq 0$ for principal blocks having abelian defect group, for all blocks of the symmetric and alternating groups, for blocks of finite groups of Lie type in defining characteristic, and for blocks of general linear groups in any characteristic. Building on this, we show that if $k$ has prime characteristic $p>5$, and if $B$ is any block of $kG$ with Sylow defect group, then $\mathrm{HH}^1(B,B)\neq 0$. By the same method we also prove that if $k$ has prime characteristic $p>5$, then the first Hochschild cohomology group of any twisted group algebra is non-zero.</p></details>

When $ρ$ is generic and a good conjugate, the article "Conjectures and results on modular representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ for a $p$-adic field $K$", by Breuil-Herzig-Hu-Morra-Schraen, introduces the notion of compatibility with $ρ$ for an admissible representation of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. In loc. cit., the five authors also question whether one could recover a representation of $\mathcal{G}_{\mathbb{Q}_p}^{n-1}$, called $\overline{L}^{\boxtimes}(ρ)$ and constructed from $ρ$, from some $Π$ compatible with $ρ$ by using Zábrádi's functor $\mathbf{V}_Δ$. We give a range of results, for an arbitrary $Π$ verifying some "weak" compatibilities with $ρ$, about how badly $\mathbf{V}_Δ(Π)$ behaves. In particular, when $ρ$ is reducible and $n\geq 3$, no $Π$ compatible with $P_ρ$ can verify $\mathbf{V}_Δ(Π)\simeq \overline{L}^{\boxtimes}(ρ)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is an open problem whether $ \binom{2n}{n} $ is divisible by 4 or 9 for all $n>256$. In connection with this, we prove that for a fixed uneven $m$ the asymptotic density of $k$'s such that $ m \nmid \binom{2^{k+1}}{2^{k}} $ is 0. To do so we examine numbers of the form $α^{k}$ in base $p$, where $p$ is a prime and $(α, p)=1$. For every $n$ and $a$ we find an upper bound on the number of $k$'s less than $a$ such that $(α^{k})_p$ contains less than $n$ digits greater than $\frac{p}{2}$. This is done by showing that every sequence of the form $\langle σ_t, \dots, σ_1,σ_0 \rangle$, where $0\leq σ_i<p$ for $i\geq 1$ and $σ_0$ is in the residue class generated by $α$ modulo $p$, occurs at specific places in the representation $(α^k)_p$ as $k$ varies.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By the work of Hernandez-Leclerc, Leclerc-Plamondon, and Keller-Scherotzke, affine graded Nakajima quiver varieties associated with a Dynkin quiver $Q$ admit an algebraic description in terms of modules over the singular Nakajima category $\mathcal{S}$ and a stratification functor to the derived category of $Q$. In this paper, we extend this framework to Nakajima's $n$-fold affine graded tensor product varieties, which allow one to geometrically realize $n$-fold tensor products of standard modules over the quantum affine algebra. We introduce a category of filtrations with splitting of length $n$ of modules over a category and show that it is equivalent to the module category of a triangular matrix category. Applied to the singular Nakajima category, this yields a category $\mathcal{S}^{n\mathrm{-filt}}$ whose modules are parametrized by the points of the $n$-fold tensor product varieties. Generalizing the results of Keller-Scherotzke from $\mathcal{S}$ to $\mathcal{S}^{n\mathrm{-filt}}$, we prove that the stable category of finitely generated Gorenstein projective $\mathcal{S}^{n\mathrm{-filt}}$-modules is triangle equivalent to the derived category of the algebra of $n \times n$ upper triangular matrices over the path algebra of $Q$, and we obtain a corresponding stratification functor.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p(n)$ denote the partition function and define $p(n,k)=\sum_{j=0}^{k}\binom{n-j}{k-j}p(j)$ where $p(0)=1$. We prove that $p(n,k)$ is unimodal and satisfies $p(n,k) < \frac{2.825}{\sqrt{n}}\, 2^n $ for fixed $n\ge 1$ and all $1\le k\le n$. This result has an interesting application: the minimal dimension of a faithful module for a $k$-step nilpotent Lie algebra of dimension $n$ is bounded by $p(n,k)$ and hence by $\frac{3}{\sqrt{n}}\, 2^n $, independently of $k$. So far only the bound $n^{n-1}$ was known. We will also prove that $p(n,n-1)<\sqrt{n}\exp(π\sqrt{2n/3})$ for $n\ge 1$ and $p(n-1,n-1)<\exp (π\sqrt{2n/3} )$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Major update. We give a classification of Sturmian lattices including their hierarchical structure. The construction of aperiodic tile sets is made explicit for any quadratic expansion constants

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give an explicit algorithm to construct aperiodic tile sets based on Sturmian words of quadratic slopes. The method works for any quadratic irrational slope, and we can produce infinitely many aperiodic tile sets whose underlying scaling constant is a unit of any real quadratic field. There are two key ingredients in our construction. The first one is ``Sturmian lattices''; an interesting grid structure generated by Sturmian words that emerged in an aperiodic monotile called Smith Turtle. We shall give a classification of Sturmian lattices. The second is the bounded displacement equivalence of Delone sets, which plays a central role in this construction.</p></details>

We also set a lower bound by the resonance method when the real part is near the critical line, both of the above results refine part of Yang's work in 2022.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The question of when the derived category of a ring satisfies Brown--Adams representability is revisited via studying the transfer of pure homological dimension along definable functors: it is shown that, for any ring, the pure global dimension of the derived category is at least the pure global dimension of the ring; expanding results of Beligiannis and Keller-Christensen-Neeman. This result is obtained by constructing `change of category' isomorphisms of PExt groups across definable functors. The same isomorphisms illustrate circumstances when one can transfer the property of Brown--Adams representability. We demonstrate how these methods can be used to test whether certain derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves are a Brown category. We also make an investigation into the structure of derived categories of von Neumann regular rings, which are shown in many cases to control Brown--Adams representability; this includes a new proof of the telescope conjecture, and a new and short proof that a coherent ring satisfies Freyd's (strong) generating hypothesis if and only if it is von Neumann regular.</p></details>
