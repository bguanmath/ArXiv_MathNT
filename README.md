<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the function field analogue of Shanks bias. For Liouville function $λ(f)$, we compare the number of monic polynomials $f$ with $λ(f) χ_m(f) = 1$ and $λ(f) χ_m(f) = -1$ for a nontrivial quadratic character $χ_m$ modulo a monic square-free polynomial $m$ over a finite field. Under Grand Simplicity Hypothesis (GSH) for $L$-functions, we prove that $λ\cdot χ_m$ is biased towards $+1$. We also give some examples where GSH is violated.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $π$ be a polarized, regular algebraic, cuspidal automorphic representation of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{A}_F)$ where $F$ is totally real or imaginary CM, and let $(ρ_λ)_λ$ be its associated compatible system of Galois representations. Suppose that $7\nmid n$ and, if $4\mid n$, then $n = 4p$ for some prime number $p$. We prove that there is a Dirichlet density $1$ set of rational primes $\mathcal{L}$ such that whenever $λ\mid \ell$ for some $\ell\in \mathcal{L}$, then $ρ_λ$ is irreducible.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 42 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article we study solutions to the generalized Fermat equation $x^q+y^p+z^r=0 $ using hypergeometric motives within the framework of the modular method. In doing so, we give an explicit description of the ramification behavior at primes dividing $2qr$ and analyze the contribution of trivial solutions. We identify a general obstruction to the modular method that accounts for its failure in many instances. As an application, assuming a standard large image conjecture, we prove that the previous equation admits no nontrivial primitive solutions $(a,b,c)$ with $3 \nmid c$, when $q=5,$ $r=3$ and $p$ is a prime sufficiently large.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Version 2: 16 pages, added references, minor corrections

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the first part of the paper, we fix a non-CM elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ and an odd prime $\ell$ and investigate the distribution of invariants associated to the $\ell$-volcano containing the reduction $E_p$, as $p$ ranges over primes of good ordinary reduction. Let $H(p)$ be the height of the volcano and let $d'(p)$ denote the relative position of $j(E_p)$ above the floor, and let $r\ge 0$ be an integer. Assuming that the $\ell$-adic Galois representation attached to $E$ is surjective, we derive an explicit formula for the natural density of primes $p$ for which $H(p)=r$ (resp.\ $d'(p)=r$). In the non-surjective case, we show that all sufficiently large heights occur with positive density. In the second part of the paper, we analyze the distribution of $\ell$-volcano heights over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ and consider the limit as $q\to\infty$. Using analytic estimates for sums of Hurwitz class numbers in arithmetic progressions, we compute exact limiting densities for ordinary elliptic curves whose $\ell$-isogeny graph has a prescribed height $r$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $5 \leq k \leq 11$ and $0\leq i \leq k-1$ be integers. We determine all solutions to the equation \begin{align*} n(n+d)(n+2d)\cdots(n+(i-1)d)(n+(i+1)d) \cdots (n+(k-1)d) = y^3 \end{align*} in integers $n,d,y$ with $ny \neq 0$, $d\geq 1$, and $\text{gcd}(n,d) = 1$. Our method relies on the theory of elliptic curves, including elliptic curve Chabauty over a number field. As an application, we answer a question of Das, Laishram, Saradha, and Sharma concerning rational points on a certain superelliptic curve.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 37 pages, in french; v2: A part of the 4th section has been rewritten to slightly strengthened the main result

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X$ be an algebraic variety over $\mathbb{C}$ and $G$ be an algebraic group acting on $X$ whose action is closed. J. Poineau defined a compactification $X^\urcorner$ of $X(\mathbb{C})$ by using hybrid Berkovich spaces. We will focus on the extension of the action of $G$ on this compactification by characterising the set $\mathcal{U} \subset X^\urcorner$ where the action is well defined. We will also show that the quotient of $\mathcal{U}$ by the action of $G$ is homeomorphic to $(X/G)^\urcorner$, the compactification of $(X/G)(\mathbb{C})$. We then apply these results to $X = \mathrm{Rat}_d$, the space of rational maps and $G = \mathrm{SL}_2$. It gives the results of C. Favre-C. Gong in a more general setting. Furthermore, we get a compactification of $\mathrm{M}_d = \mathrm{Rat}_d/\mathrm{SL}_2$ where the boundary is made of orbits of non-archimedean rational maps. The results still holds if $\mathbb{C}$ is replaced by $k$ a non-trivially valued field and complex analytic spaces by Berkovich spaces over $k$ or if $X$ is the set of stable points of a $k$-variety defined in the sense of GIT.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a semisimple compact Lie group $G$ and a nonzero dominant integral weight $λ$, the highest weight $G_q$-modules $V_{nλ}$ form a subproduct system of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Using a conjectural asymptotic behavior of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients we identify the corresponding Cuntz-Pimsner algebras with algebras of quantized functions on homogeneous spaces of $G$. We also show that the gauge-invariant part of the Toeplitz algebra provides a model for convergence of full matrix algebras to quantum flag manifolds, complementing and generalizing results of Landsman and Rieffel for $q=1$ and results of Vaes-Vergnioux in the rank one case for $q\ne1$. We verify our conjecture on Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for $G=SU(n)$ and all weights that are either regular or multiples of the fundamental weight $ω_1$. For $λ=ω_1$, we also provide a detailed description of the Toeplitz and Cuntz-Pimsner algebras, generalizing results of Arveson on symmetric subproduct systems.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Luka Milićević, Žarko Ranđelović &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 26 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we prove power-saving bounds for the corelation of the Möbius function with polynomial phases of degree $k$ in function fields $\mathbb{F}_p[t]$, when $p > k$. The proof relies on a new approximation result for phases of biased multilinear forms and the recently established strong bounds for the problem of finding bounded codimension varieties inside the dense ones. Along the way, we also obtain polynomial bounds in the inverse theorem for Gowers uniformity norms in the special case of polynomial phases in finite vector spaces.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Chantal David, Lucile Devin, Ezra Waxman &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 44 pages. Revised version. Published in Mathematika

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the low-lying zeros of a family of $L$-functions attached to the CM elliptic curve $E_d \;:\; y^2 = x^3 - dx$, for each odd and square-free integer $d$. Specifically, upon writing the $L$-function of $E_d$ as $L(s-\frac12, ξ_d)$ for the appropriate Grössencharakter $ξ_d$ of conductor $\mathfrak{f}_d$, we consider the collection $\mathcal{F}_d$ of $L$-functions attached to $ξ_{d,k}$, $k \geq 1$, where for each integer $k$, $ξ_{d, k}$ denotes the primitive character inducing $ξ_d^k$. We observe that $25\%$ of the $L$-functions in $\mathcal{F}_d$ have negative root number. $\mathcal{F}_d$ is thus not one of the essentially homogeneous families of the Universality Conjecture of Sarnak, Shin and Templier, with unitary, symplectic or orthogonal (odd or even) symmetry type. By computing the one-level density in the family of $L$-functions in $\mathcal{F}_{d}$ with conductor at most $K^2 \mathrm N (\mathfrak{f}_d)$, we find that $\mathcal{F}_d$ naturally decomposes into subfamilies: more specifically, a collection of symplectic ($L(s, ξ_{d,k})$ for $k \equiv α\bmod 8$, $α$ even) and orthogonal ($L(s, ξ_{d,k})$ for $k \equiv α\bmod 8$, $α$ odd) subfamilies. For each such subfamily, we moreover compute explicit lower order terms in decreasing powers of $\log (K^2 \mathrm N(\mathfrak{f}_d))$.</p></details>

In this paper we present two (infinite-dimensional) non-isomorphic algebras over $\mathbb{C}$ with isomorphic Loday functors -- the algebras of continuous functions on the Möbius strip and on the cylinder.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, several studies have shown that when $q\equiv3\pmod{4}$, the function $F_r(x)=x^r+x^{r+\frac{q-1}{2}}$ defined over $\mathbb{F}_q$ is locally-APN and has boomerang uniformity at most~$2$. In this paper, we extend these results by showing that if there is at most one $x\in \mathbb{F}_q$ with $χ(x)=χ(x+1)=1$ satisfying $(x+1)^r - x^r = b$ for all $b\in \mathbb{F}_q^*$ and $\gcd(r,q-1)\mid 2$, then $F_r$ is locally-APN with boomerang uniformity at most $2$. Moreover, we study the differential spectra of $F_3$ and $F_{\frac{2q-1}{3}}$, and the boomerang spectrum of $F_2$ when $p=3$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we use two different approaches -- one algebraic and the other analytic -- to study the variation of Iwasawa invariants of rational elliptic curves in some quadratic twist families. The analytic approach involves a thorough investigation of half-integral weight modular forms. On the other hand, the algebraic proof requires studying the BDP-Selmer groups and the fine Selmer groups.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yochay Jerby &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1973 Montgomery formulated the pair correlation conjecture, predicting that the local spacing statistics of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function coincide with those of eigenvalues of large Hermitian matrices from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). The zeta function, however, is a fixed deterministic object, and the mechanism by which its zeros reproduce random matrix statistics has remained unclear. In this paper, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we prove Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of Hardy's $Z$-function. Building on earlier works, we use a finite-dimensional variational space of sections $Z_N(t;a)$ that approximate $Z(t)$ on each window $[2N,2N+2]$. Inside this space we define the real hall $\mathcal{RH}_N(\mathbb{R})$, consisting of those sections whose zeros in the corresponding critical rectangle are real, simple, and remain so along any homotopy from the core section. This real hall plays the role of a random matrix ensemble. Equipping it with an admissible probability measure with smooth, positive density on the coefficient space, we construct a Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equation with reflection at the discriminant boundary. We show that the induced dynamics of the unfolded zeros are, in the bulk, equivalent in law to Dyson Brownian motion with $β=2$, and by invoking modern universality results for Dyson Brownian motion and log-gases we obtain that, for any such measure, the ensemble-averaged local pair-correlation converges to the GUE sine-kernel law. Finally, using Selberg's probabilistic theory of the argument $S(t)$, we prove that the pair-correlation observables of the canonical approximants $Z_N(t;1)$ over disjoint windows behave asymptotically like decorrelated samples drawn from this GUE-distributed ensemble, and we upgrade the averaged GUE law to a deterministic pair-correlation law for the zeros of $Z(t)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 36 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We examine the cell modules for the category of type An webs and their natural cellular forms. We modify the bases of these modules, as described by Elias, to obtain an orthogonal basis of each cell module. Hence, we calculate the determinant of the Gram matrix with respect to such bases. These Gram determinants are given in terms of intersection forms, computed from certain traces of clasps - higher order Jones-Wenzl morphisms. Additionally, the modified basis is constructed using these clasps, and each clasp is constructed using traces of smaller clasps. Elias conjectures a value for these intersection forms and verifies it in types $A_1$, $A_2$ and $A_3$. This paper concludes with a proof of the conjecture in type $A_n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use the Jucys-Murphy elements of the BMW algebra to show that its center over the complex numbers for almost all parameters making it semisimple is given by Wheel Laurent polynomials, a subalgebra of the symmetric Laurent polynomials in the JM elements. As an application, we give an Okounkov-Vershik like approach to its finite dimensional representations. In the non semisimple case related to the type B Lie algebras, the central subalgebra of Wheel Laurent polynomials is large enough to separate blocks of the BMW algebras.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 75 pages, 15 figures, 13 tables, comments are welcome! This version fixes a few typos, clarifies some material, and streamlines the argument in Section 10

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a rigorous proof of the Gang-Yonekura formula describing the transformation of the 3D index under Dehn filling a cusp in an orientable 3-manifold. The 3D index, originally introduced by Dimofte, Gaiotto and Gukov, is a physically inspired q-series that encodes deep topological and geometric information about cusped 3-manifolds. Building on the interpretation of the 3D index as a generating function over Q-normal surfaces, we introduce a relative version of the index for ideal triangulations with exposed boundary. This notion allows us to formulate a relative Gang-Yonekura formula, which we prove by developing a gluing principle for relative indices and establishing an inductive framework in the case of layered solid tori. Our approach makes use of Garoufalidis-Kashaev's meromorphic extension of the index, along with new identities involving q-hypergeometric functions. As an application, we study the limiting behaviour of the index for large fillings. We also develop code to perform certified computations of the index, guaranteeing correctness up to a specified accuracy. Our extensive computations support the topological invariance of the 3D index and suggest a well-defined extension to closed manifolds.</p></details>

In this paper, we study the sign behavior o of the coefficients $A(n),B(n)$ and $D(n).$ We prove that for all integers $n\geq0,$ \begin{align*} A(5n)<0\quad(n\neq0),\qquad B(5n) < 0\quad(n\neq0),\qquad D(5n+1)>0. \end{align*} This confirms a recent conjecture of Baruah and Sarma. Our proof is different from the previous method of Baruah and Sarma, and combines asymptotic coefficient analysis with symbolic computation for finite case verification.</p></details>

Given an integer $t\geq2$ and a real, positive function $ψ$, let $W_{t}(ψ)$ denote the set of $x$ in $[0,1]$ for which $|x-p/t^{n}|<ψ(n)$ for infinitely many $(p,n)\in\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{N}$. We prove a general Hausdorff dimension result concerning the intersection of $W_{t}(ψ)$ with an arbitrary self similar set which implies that $\dim_{\rm H}(W_{t}(ψ)\cap C(b,D))\le\dim_{\rm H}W_{t}(ψ)\times \dim_{\rm H}C(b,D)$. When $b$ and $t$ have the same prime divisors, under certain restrictions on the digit set $D$, we give a sufficient condition for the Hausdorff measure of $W_{t}(ψ)\cap C(b,D)$ to be zero. This closes a gap in a result of Li, Li and Wu \cite{LLW2025} and shows that the dimension of the intersection can be strictly less than the product of the dimensions. The latter disproves the product conjecture of Li, Li and Wu.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There are three aims in this paper: (i) We show an isomorphism between Jacobi forms of index $D_{2n+1}$ (lattice index) and elliptic modular forms of level $2$. (ii) We give an explicit formula of Fourier coefficients of Jacobi-Eisenstein series of index $D_{2n+1}$. (iii) We construct a holomorphic modular form of weight $3/2$ of level $8$ from the Zagier Eisenstein series $\mathscr{F}$ of weight $3/2$ of level $4$. Moreover, we show that the four functions $E^*_2$, $η^3$, $θ^3$ and $\mathscr{F}$ have essentially the same Hecke eigenvalue $1+p$ for any odd prime $p$, where $E^*_2$ is the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series of weight $2$, $η$ is the Dedekind eta-function and $θ$ is the usual theta function. This fact follows from a special case of the isomorphism of (i). As an application, we give a formula for a sum of the numbers $r_3(n)$, where $r_3(n)$ is the number of representations of an integer $n \geq 0$ as a sum of $3$ squares.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Building upon the work of Stucker, Vennos, and Young we derive generalized Dedekind sums arising from period integrals applied to holomorphic Eisenstein series attached to pairs of primitive non-trivial Dirichlet characters. Furthermore, we explore a variety of properties of these generalized Dedekind sums: we develop a finite sum formula, demonstrate their behavior as quantum modular forms, provide a Fricke reciprocity law, and characterize analytic and arithmetic aspects of their image. Particularly, for the arithmetic aspect of the image, we generalize an existing conjecture to the higher weight case and provide significant computational evidence to support this generalized conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the presence of a nontrivial dual Selmer group, certain global even deformation rings are shown to be finite and flat over $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Previously, flatness was only known in established cases of Langlands reciprocity in the odd parity. By techniques from global class field theory, explicit examples of even representations are computed to which the results apply. For even representations $\overlineρ$ in an explicit family, it is observed that if Leopoldt's conjecture is true for a certain number field attached to $\overlineρ$, then the global even deformation ring is flat at the minimal level.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An endomorphism $f:\mathbb{P}^k\to\mathbb{P}^k$ of degree $d\geq2$ is said to be postcritically finite (or PCF) if its critical set $\mathrm{Crit}(f)$ is preperiodic, i.e. if there are integers $m>n\geq0$ such that $f^m(\mathrm{Crit}(f))\subseteq f^n(\mathrm{Crit}(f))$. When $k\geq2$, it was conjectured by Ingram, Ramadas and Silverman that, in the space $\mathrm{End}_d^k$ of all endomorphisms of degree $d$ of $\mathbb{P}^k$, such endomorphisms are not Zariski dense. We prove this conjecture. Further, in the space $\mathrm{Poly}_d^2$ of all regular polynomial endomorphisms of degree $d\geq2$ of the affine plane $\mathbb{A}^2$, we construct a dense and Zariski open subset where we have a uniform bound on the number of preperiodic points lying in the critical set. The proofs are a combination of the theory of heights in arithmetic dynamics and methods from real dynamics to produce open subsets with maximal bifurcation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a relative version of the Crane-Yetter topological quantum field theory in four dimensions, from non-semisimple data. Our theory is defined relative to the classical $G$-gauge theory in five dimensions -- this latter theory assigns to each manifold $M$ the appropriate linearization of the moduli stack of $G$-local systems, called the character stack. Our main result is to establish a relative invertibility property for our construction. This invertibility generalizes the key invertibility property of the original Crane-Yetter theory which allowed it to capture the framing anomaly of the celebrated Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev theory. In particular our invertibilty statement at the level of surfaces implies a categorical, stacky version of the unicity theorem for skein algebras; at the level of 3-manifolds it equips the character stack with a canonical line bundle. Regarded as a topological symmetry defect of classical gauge theory, our work establishes invertibility of this defect by a gauging procedure.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study Euclidean ideal classes in real biquadratic fields and obtain unconditional existence results via genus theory. Lenstra showed (assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis) that a number field with unit rank at least one admits a Euclidean ideal precisely when its class group is cyclic; subsequent work has aimed to remove the GRH hypothesis in special families. Focusing on real biquadratic fields $K=\mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{d_1},\sqrt{d_2}\right)$ with $2\nmid d_1d_2$, we prove that if the class group $\mathrm{Cl}_K$ is cyclic and the Hilbert class field $H(K)$ is abelian over $\mathbb{Q}$, then $K$ contains a Euclidean ideal class (unconditionally). We also analyse the distribution of genus numbers in a natural family of biquadratic fields and, using these statistics, show that the set of biquadratic fields admitting a Euclidean ideal has density zero.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Hopf envelope of a bialgebra is the free Hopf algebra generated by the given bialgebra. Its existence, as well as that of the cofree Hopf algebra, is a well-known fact in Hopf algebra theory, but their construction is not particularly handy or friendly. In this note, we offer a novel realisation of the Hopf envelope and of the cofree Hopf algebra of a finite-dimensional bialgebra as a particular quotient and sub-bialgebra, respectively, of the bialgebra itself. Our construction can also be extended to the infinite-dimensional case, provided that the bialgebra satisfies additional conditions, such as being right perfect as an algebra or admitting a $n$-antipode, the latter being a notion hereby introduced. Remarkably, the machinery we develop also allows us to give a new description of the Hopf envelope of a commutative bialgebra and of the cofree cocommutative Hopf algebra of a cocommutative bialgebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish an asymptotic formula for the number of $\mathcal{M}$-points of bounded height on split toric varieties, for the height induced by any big and nef divisor class. This formula establishes new cases of the extension of Manin's conjecture to $\mathcal{M}$-points, as introduced by the author. As a special case of our result, we strengthen the results obtained by Pieropan and Schindler on Campana points of bounded height on toric varieties. As another special case, we obtain an asymptotic for the number of weak Campana points of bounded height, which is novel even for projective space. We illustrate our result by giving an asymptotic for the number of points on projective space of bounded height for which the product of coordinates is powerful.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Grounded partitions, introduced by Dousse and Konan, are coloured partitions satisfying difference conditions given by a matrix with nonnegative integer entries. For the matrices studied in this paper, the generating functions are known to be infinite products, corresponding to the principal specialisation of characters of highest weight modules of type $A_1^{(1)}$. We give the first bijective proof that the generating functions of grounded partitions at level $2$ are infinite products. We then give a new combinatorial model for affine crystal graphs of type $A_1^{(1)}$ at level $2$, where the vertices are grounded partitions and the arrows are given by explicit bracketing rules. The grounded partition model for affine crystal graphs of highest weights $Λ_0$, $Λ_1$ and $Λ_0 + Λ_1$ gives rise to new $q$-series identities obtained by decomposing the affine crystal graphs into the crystal graphs of finite type $A_1$ via the restricted representation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The notion of $θ$-congruent numbers generalizes the classical congruent number problem.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The orbit method in its quantitative form due to Nelson and Venkatesh has played a central role in recent advances in the analytic theory of higher rank $L$-functions. The goal of this note is to explain how the method can be applied to the sup-norm problem for automorphic forms on $\mathrm{PGL}(2)$. Doing so, we prove a new hybrid bound for newforms $\varphi$ of large prime-power level $N = p^{4n}$ and large eigenvalue $λ$. It states that $\| \varphi \|_\infty \ll_p (λN)^{5/24 + \varepsilon}$, recovering the result of Iwaniec and Sarnak spectrally and improving the local bound in the depth aspect for the first time in this non-compact setting. We also provide an exposition of the microlocal tools used, illustrating and motivating the theory through the classical case of $\mathrm{PGL}(2)$, following notes and lectures of Nelson and Venkatesh.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the function field setting with a fixed characteristic, it was proven by the second and third authors that the values $\log \big|L\big(\frac12, χ_D\big)\big|$ as $D$ varies over monic and square-free polynomials are asymptotically Gaussian distributed on the assumption of a low lying zeros hypothesis as the degree of $D$ tends to $\infty$. For real distinct shifts $t_j$ all of microscopic size or all of nonmicroscopic size relative to the genus, we consider linear combinations of $\log\big|L\big(\frac12+it_j, χ_D\big)\big|$ with real coefficients, and separately, of $\arg L\big(\frac12+it_j, χ_D\big).$ We provide estimates for their distribution functions under the low lying zeros hypothesis. We similarly study distribution functions of linear combinations of $\log\big|L\big(\frac12+it_j, E\otimes χ_D\big)\big|$, and separately $\arg L\big(\frac12+it_j, E\otimesχ_D\big)$, for quadratic twists of elliptic curves $E$ with root number one as the conductor gets large. As an application of these results, we prove a central limit theorem for the fluctuation of the number of nontrivial zeros of such $L$-functions from its mean, and thus recover previous results by Faifman and Rudnick. Correlations of such fluctuations are in harmony with the results of Bourgade, Coram and Diaconis, and Wieand for zeros of the Riemann zeta function and for eigenangles of unitary random matrices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a short and elementary argument answering a question of Erdős and Ingham negatively. Erdős and Ingham showed that a Tauberian estimate they considered was equivalent to the non-vanishing of $1+\sum_{k}a_k^{-1-it}$ for any real number $t$ and any sequence $1<a_1<a_2<\cdots$ of positive integers such that $\sum_k a_k^{-1}<\infty$. We disprove this statement. In fact, we show that for any complex number $λ$ and any non-zero real number $t$, there exists a sequence $1<a_1<a_2<\cdots$ of positive integers such that $\sum_k a_k^{-1}<\infty$ and $\sum_k a_k^{-1-it} = λ$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using a construction of Kanemitsu from [9] and observations by Rampazzo in [19], we find examples of zero divisors in the Grothendieck ring of varieties by taking the zero loci of sections of vector bundles over symplectic and $F_4$ Grassmannians. These zero divisors yield instances of non-trivially L-equivalent Calabi-Yau varieties. This methodology is inspired by a similar process performed by Ito et al. on $G_2$ Grassmannians in [8].</p></details>

Let $x$ be large, and assume that, for some real number $τ$, the quantities $r(p)-\Re\{f(p)/p^{iτ}\}$ are small in various appropriate average senses over the set of prime numbers not exceeding $x$. We derive from recent effective mean-value estimates an effective comparison theorem between the mean-values of $f$ and of $r$ on the set of integers $\leqslant x$. We also provide effective estimates for certain weighted moments of additive functions and for sifted mean-values of non-negative multiplicative functions.</p></details>

Oh, and we elaborate on them further in this revision

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is subsequent to [5]. In this paper, we extend the classification of hyperbolic Dehn fillings with sufficiently large coefficients by addressing the remaining case not covered in [5]. Specifically, by considering the case in which the two cusp shapes lie in the same quadratic field, we obtain the complete classification under a mild assumption satisfied by most manifolds. The content of this paper is not limited to the classification of hyperbolic Dehn fillings. Along the way, we also classify key types of automorphisms of the holonomy variety of a two-cusped hyperbolic $3$-manifold and uncover an intriguing hidden structure in the complex volume of certain manifolds. Concrete examples illustrating these phenomena were discovered by S. Oh, and we elaborate on them in this paper. All the results presented here appear to be effective. In the third paper of this series, joint with S. Oh, we will provide examples confirming the optimality of our results.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 7 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The sequence $A067549$ of The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences is defined as $(a_k)_{k \geq 1}$ with $a_k$ being the determinant of the $k \times k$ matrix whose diagonal contains the first $k$ prime numbers and all other elements are ones. We relate this sequence to a concrete counting problem. Choose an arbitrary residue class $r_i$ for each prime $p_i$ with $1 \leq i \leq k$ and set $P_k = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i$. We show that $a_k$ is the number of integers in $[1, P_k]$ that are contained in \emph{at most} one of the $k$ chosen residue classes. Interestingly, we show that this sequence is closely related to the better known sequence $A005867$ for which we derive a novel characterisation in terms of determinants and which gives the number of integers in $[1, P_k]$ that are not contained in any of the $k$ residue classes. Our proof is purely structural and, therefore, it can be generalised to counting appearances of integers in residue classes of arbitrary arithmetic progressions generated by $k$ different primes using the determinant of a matrix of ones having those $k$ primes on its diagonal. The revealed structure also offers a fast way of calculating such determinants.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a complete description of the A$_\infty$ deformation theory of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of graded surfaces. We show that any abstract A$_\infty$ deformation is "geometric", namely it is equivalent to the partially wrapped Fukaya category of an orbifold surface obtained as a partial compactification of the original surface. For certain genus 0 surfaces, these deformations are generically Fukaya categories of compact pillowcases. We introduce the notion of a weak dual and use unbounded twisted complexes to overcome the curvature problem that naturally arises when some of the boundary components are fully wrapped. Our results provide a first account of the relationship between A$_\infty$ deformations of Fukaya categories and partial compactifications, as advocated in P. Seidel's ICM 2002 address, in the presence of stop data. All of our results also hold when the original surface has finitely many order 2 orbifold points.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We assemble three basic analytic inputs -- the Kuznetsov trace formula on $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ with explicit continuous spectrum, the $\mathrm{GL}_3$ Voronoi formula, and $t$-aspect second-moment bounds for $L(1/2+it,\varphi)$ -- into a single framework for a smoothed $\mathrm{GL}_3$ spectral average. For a fixed Hecke-Maass cusp form $\varphi$ on $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb Z)$, we evaluate a weight-$0$ spectral average of $L(1/2,\varphi\times f_j)$ over the $\mathrm{GL}_2$ Maass spectrum. In the Kuznetsov normalization where the diagonal transform has density $t\tanh(πt)$, the diagonal contributes exactly $2\mathcal H_0[h]$; the off-diagonal and the continuous spectrum are bounded with power savings consistent with the currently best unconditional second-moment bounds in the $\mathrm{GL}_3$ $t$-aspect. The argument is organized into a sequence of steps: normalizations and approximate functional equations, insertion into Kuznetsov, Voronoi summation on $\mathrm{GL}_3$, a bilinear estimate for the off-diagonal, evaluation of the diagonal and the Eisenstein contribution, moment refinements and parameter optimization, and finally plateau-smooth spectral windows and standard generalizations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Heilbronn gave a sufficient condition for a number field with a totally ramified prime to fail to be norm-Euclidean. We say that Heilbronn's criterion applies to a polynomial $f$ if it applies to the number field $K=\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f)$ generated by $f$. Suppose $n\geq 3$ is odd and $p\geq 5$ is prime with $\gcd(p-1,n)=1$. Let $\mathcal{F}_{p,n}$ denote the collection of monic polynomials $f\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ of degree $n$ that are Eisenstein at the prime $p$. We order our polynomials by the natural height $\mathrm{Ht}(f)$. Define $δ_{p,n}(X)$ to be the proportion of polynomials $f\in\mathcal{F}_{p,n}$ with $\mathrm{Ht}(f)\leq X$ for which Heilbronn's criterion applies. One has $$\liminf_{X\to\infty}δ_{p,n}(X)\geq \max\left\{\frac{2}{27}\,,\;1-\varepsilon(p)\right\}\,,$$ where $\varepsilon(p)\to 0$ and is effectively computable. In particular, the lower density tends to $1$ as $p\to\infty$ uniformly in $n$. We also give a version of this result where we weaken the condition on $\gcd(p-1,n)$. As a corollary, we show that given an integer $n\geq 2$, a positive proportion of Eisenstein polynomials of degree $n$ fail to generate norm-Euclidean fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we investigate multiple polylogarithms with non-positive multi-indices (nonpositive MPLs) from a combinatorial and algebraic viewpoint. By introducing a correspondence between non-positive multiple polylogarithms and Magnus polynomials in a free associative algebra, we obtain an explicit Magnus-type representation of products of mono-indexed non-positive MPLs. The main identity (Theorem A) expresses such a product as a single non-positive MPL indexed by a Magnus polynomial, which may be regarded as a Möbius inversion of the expansion formula due to Duchamp-Hoang Ngoc Minh-Ngo. Moreover, we study the effects of permuted indices and show that certain differences of Magnus polynomials belong to the kernel of the linear map ${\rm Li}^-_{\bullet}$ , leading to new functional equations among non-positive MPLs of the same weight and depth. These results clarify the combinatorial structure underlying non-positive MPLs and reveal a close connection with the Magnus expansion in non-commutative algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The well-known Hardy--Ramanujan inequality states that if $ω(n)$ denotes the number of distinct prime factors of a positive integer $n$, then there is an absolute constant $C>0$ such that uniformly for $x\ge2$ and $k\in\mathbb{N}$, $$\#\{n\le x\colonω(n)=k\}\ll\frac{x(\log\log x+C)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!\log x}.$$ A myriad of generalizations and variations of this inequality have been discovered. In this paper, we establish a weighted version of this inequality for sifted sets, which generalizes an earlier result of Halász and implies Timofeev's theorems on shifted primes. We then explore its applications to a variety of intriguing problems, such as large deviations of $ω$ on subsets of integers, the Erdős multiplication table problem, divisors of shifted primes, and the image of the Carmichael $λ$-function. Building on the same circle of ideas, we also generalize Troupe's result on the normal order of $ω(s(n))$ for the sum-of-proper-divisors function $s(n)$, confirming for the first time the weighted version of a special case of a 1992 conjecture by Erdős, Granville, Pomerance, and Spiro.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Zamolodchikov periodicity is a property of certain discrete dynamical systems and was one of the primary motivations for the creation of cluster algebras. It was first observed by Zamolodchikov in his study of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, initially for simply-laced Dynkin diagrams. It was proved by Keller to hold for tensor products of two Dynkin diagrams, and further shown by Galashin and Pylyavskyy to hold for pairs of commuting simply-laced Cartan matrices of finite type, which Stembridge classified in his study of admissible $W$-cells. We prove that the Zamolodchikov periodic cluster algebras are in bijection with pairs of commuting (not necessarily reduced or simply-laced) Cartan matrices of finite type. We fully classify all such pairs into 29 infinite families and 14 exceptional types in addition to the 6 infinite families and 11 exceptional types in Stembridge's classification, and show that all of these families can be derived from simply-laced types through two operations preserving Zamolodchikov periodicity, folding and taking transpose. Our work holds connections to Kazhdan--Lusztig theory, and our main theorem helps classify all nonnegative $W$-cells for products of two dihedral groups, $W = I_2(p)\times I_2(q)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For semisimple Lie algebras, the BGG resolution is commonly interpreted as a categorification of the Weyl character formula. For general linear Lie superalgebras, the Kac--Wakimoto character formula is regarded as a good character formula for a certain class of ``singular'' weights (the so-called Kac--Wakimoto weights). However, the combinatorial factor $\frac{1}{\mathrm{atyp}(λ)!}$ makes a direct BGG-type categorification of this formula rather elusive. In this paper we construct, for a certain class of ``generic'' weights, a resolution that categorifies a known Weyl-type finite-sum character formula of the same flavour as the Kac--Wakimoto formula. Our resolution is built from taking images of canonical homomorphisms between Verma modules corresponding to non-conjugate Borel subalgebras via odd reflections. Note that, while the infinite resolution of Kac--Wakimoto simple modules by Kac modules constructed by Brundan--Stroppel~\cite{brundan2010highestII} does not directly generalize the classical BGG resolution, the construction developed here does.</p></details>

We then introduce the generalized discrete Markov spectrum, defined analogously via the generalized Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k_1 yz + k_2 zx + k_3 xy = (3 + k_1 + k_2 + k_3) xyz.$ We prove that this generalized spectrum is contained in the Markov-Lagrange spectrum and thus the Markov spectrum.</p></details>

For a prime $p$ chosen uniformly at random from $(x, 2x]$, we express the probability that all partial sums of $\frac{χ_p(n)}{n}$ are nonnegative in terms of the probability that partial sums of $\frac{f(n)}{n}$ are nonnegative.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We address two questions related to the semiampleness of line bundles arising from Hodge theory. First, we prove there is a functorial compactification of the image of a period map of a polarizable integral pure variation of Hodge structures for which the Griffiths bundle extends amply. In particular the Griffiths bundle is semiample. We prove more generally that the Hodge bundle of a Calabi--Yau variation of Hodge structures is semiample subject to some extra conditions, and as our second result deduce the b-semiampleness conjecture and the existence of a functorial Hodge-theoretic compactification of moduli spaces of polarized Calabi--Yau varieties. The semiampleness results (and the construction of the Baily--Borel compactifications) crucially use o-minimal GAGA, and the deduction of the b-semiampleness conjecture uses work of Ambro and results of Kollár on the geometry of minimal lc centers to verify the extra conditions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent work, we introduced \textit{LC-functions} $L(s,f)$, associated to a certain real-analytic function $f$ at $0$, extending the concept of the Hurwitz zeta function and its formula. In this paper, we establish the existence of a functional equation for a specific class of LC-functions. More precisely, we demonstrate that if the function $p_f(t):=f(t)(e^t-1)/t$, called the \textit{modulator} of $L(s,f)$, exhibits even or odd symmetry, the \textit{LC-function formula} -- a generalization of the Hurwitz formula -- naturally simplifies to a functional equation analogous to that of the Dirichlet L-function $L(s,χ)$, associated to a primitive character $χ$ of inherent parity. Furthermore, using this equation, we derive a general formula for the values of these LC-functions at even or odd positive integers, depending on whether the modulator $p_f$ is even or odd, respectively. Two illustrative examples of the functional equation are provided for distinct parity of modulators.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2008, Pritsker introduced the areal Mahler measure, which is defined using an integral over the unit disk, as opposed to the classical Mahler measure which is defined using an integral over the unit circle. In this paper we introduce areal Weil heights, which generalize the areal Mahler measure to the adelic setting. We use the framework of adelic heights established by Favre and Rivera-Letelier and we construct a $p$-adic analog for the area measure on a disk in $\mathbb{C}$. For areal Weil heights we prove an analog of Kronecker's theorem, which characterizes their small points and essential minima. Furthermore, we determine equidistribution theorems for areal Weil heights. In some cases, they have a unique limiting distribution for small points, while in others there are infinitely many limiting distributions. We conclude with examples. In one of our examples, we determine for which radii $r$ there exist sequences of conjugate sets of algebraic integers which uniformly distribute to the disk $D(0,r) \subset \mathbb{C}$, and we compute the limiting height for such sequences.</p></details>

We consider the specialized skew hook Schur polynomial $\text{hs}_{λ/μ}(X,ωX,\dots,ω^{t-1}X/Y,ωY,\dots,ω^{t-1}Y)$, where $ω^k X=(ω^k x_1, \dots, ω^k x_n)$, $ω^k Y=(ω^k y_1, \dots, ω^k y_m)$ for $0 \leq k \leq t-1$. We characterize the skew shapes $λ/μ$ for which the polynomial vanishes and prove that the nonzero polynomial factorizes into smaller skew hook Schur polynomials. Then we give a combinatorial interpretation of $\text{hs}_{λ/μ}(1,ω^d,\dots,ω^{d(tn-1)}/1,ω^d,\dots,ω^{d(tm-1)})$, for all divisors $d$ of $t$, in terms of ribbon supertableaux. Lastly, we use the combinatorial interpretation to prove the cyclic sieving phenomenon on the set of semistandard supertableaux of shape $λ/μ$ for odd $t$. Using a similar proof strategy, we give a complete generalization of a result of Lee--Oh (arXiv: 2112.12394, 2021) for the cyclic sieving phenomenon on the set of skew SSYT conjectured by Alexandersson--Pfannerer--Rubey--Uhlin (Forum Math.

> **Comment:** The presentation has been polished and slightly expanded. In particular, the background is discussed quite thoroughly, namely the brick labels of neighbor torsion classes. Also, brick finiteness is now characterized in several ways, including a reference to $τ$-tilting theory

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We deal with the category of finitely generated modules over an artin algebra $A$. Recall that an object in an abelian category is said to be a brick provided its endomorphism ring is a division ring. Simple modules are, of course, bricks, but in case $A$ is connected and not local, there do exist bricks which are not simple. The aim of this survey is to focus the attention to filtrations of modules where all factors are bricks, with bricks being ordered in some definite way. In general, a module category will have many oriented cycles. Recently, Demonet has proposed to look at so-called brick chains in order to deal with a very interesting directedness feature of a module category. These are the orderings of bricks which we will use. This is a survey which relies on recent investigations by a quite large group of mathematicians. We have singled out some important observations and have reordered them in order to obtain a completely self-contained (and elementary) treatment of the relevance of bricks in a module category. (Most of the papers we rely on are devoted to what is called $τ$-tilting theory, but for the results we are interested in, there is no need to deal with $τ$-tilting, or even with the Auslander-Reiten translation $τ$).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The category $\bcalNT$ was defined in \cite{Lobos2}, it is a category whose objects are commutative nil graded algebras over a field, defined by presentation encoded by triangular matrices. A natural problem related to this category is to reach a complete classification up to isomorphism of its objects. Based in some results coming from \cite{Lobos2}, we can divide this problem by working with encoding matrices of a fixed size $n.$ In \cite{Lobos3} and \cite{Lobos4}, there are several advances for this search, in particular, in \cite{Lobos3} one can see that, for small matrices, the number of isomorphism classes seems to be finite and independent on the ground field. That fact, opened a series of questions related with the number of isomorphism classes and its relation with the ground field. At that point it was no clear, under which conditions of the ground field, this number could be finite. In this article, among other results, we prove that for each $n\geq4,$ the number of isomorphism classes is finite if and only if the ground field is finite.</p></details>

Assume we know the location of the poles of $A(s)$ with $|\Im s| \leq T$, and their residues, for some large constant $T$. It is natural to ask how such finite spectral information may be best used to estimate partial sums $\sum_{n\leq x} a_n$. Here, we prove a sharp, general result on sums $\sum_{n\leq x} a_n n^{-σ}$ for $a_n$ non-negative, giving an optimal way to use information on the poles of $A(s)$ with $|\Im s|\leq T$, with no need for zero-free regions. We give not just bounds, but an explicit formula with compact support. Our bounds on $ψ(x)-x$ are, unsurprisingly, better and often simpler than a long list of existing explicit versions of the Prime Number Theorem. We treat the case of $M(x)$ and similar functions in a companion paper. Our solution mixes a Fourier-analytic approach in the style of Wiener--Ikehara with contour-shifting, using optimal approximants of Beurling--Selberg type found in (Graham--Vaaler, 1981).</p></details>

We identify $C_{f,d}$ with its canonical image in $J(C_{f,d})$ (such that the infinite point of $C_{f,d}$ goes to the zero of the group law on $J(C_{f,d})$). We say that an integer $m>1$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K_0$ if there exists a polynomial $f(x)$ as above such that $C_{f,d}(K_0)$ contains a torsion point of order $m$. Earlier we proved that if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable, then either $m=d$ or $m \geq n$ (in addition, both $d$ and $n$ are $(n,d)$-reachable). In the present paper we prove the following. If $n<m<2n$ and if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K_0$, then either $d|m$ or $m \equiv n \bmod d$.

We extend many of Sam--Snowden's far-reaching results from characteristic zero to this setting. For example, while the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of a finitely generated GL-equivariant $S$-module need not be finite in positive characteristic, we show that the resolution still has finitely many "linear strands of higher slope". The crux of this paper is two technical results. The first is an extension to positive characteristic of Snowden's recent linearization of Draisma's embedding theorem which we use to study the generic category of $S$-modules. The second is a Nagpal-type "shift theorem" about torsion $S$-modules for which we introduce certain categorifications of the Hasse derivative. These two results together allow us to obtain explicit generators for the derived category. In a follow-up paper, we also use these results to prove finiteness results for local cohomology modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The low-energy expansion of genus-one string amplitudes produces infinite families of non-holomorphic modular forms after each step of integrating over a point on the torus worldsheet which are known as elliptic modular graph forms (eMGFs). We solve the differential equations of eMGFs depending on a single point $z$ and the modular parameter $τ$ via iterated integrals over holomorphic modular forms which individually transform inhomogeneously under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$. Suitable generating series of these iterated integrals over $τ$, their complex conjugates and single-valued multiple zeta values (svMZVs) are combined to attain equivariant transformations under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ such that their components are modular forms. Our generating series of equivariant iterated integrals for eMGFs is related to elliptic multiple polylogarithms (eMPLs) through a gauge transform of the flat Calaque-Enriquez-Etingof connection. By converting iterated $τ$-integrals to iterated integrals over points on a torus, we arrive at an explicit construction of single-valued eMPLs where all the monodromies in the points cancel. Each single-valued eMPL depending on a single point $z$ is found to be a finite combination of meromorphic eMPLs, their complex conjugates, svMZVs and equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals. Our generating series determines the latter two admixtures via so-called zeta generators and Tsunogai derivations which act on the two generators $x$, $y$ of a free Lie algebra and where the coefficients of words in $x,y$ define the single-valued eMPLs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider certain families of Hecke characters $φ$ over a quadratic imaginary field $F$. According to the Bloch-Beilinson conjectures, the order of vanishing of the $L$-function $L(φ,s)$ at the central point $s=-1$ should be equal to the dimension of the space of extensions of the Tate motive $\mathbb{Q}(1)$ by the motive associated with $φ$. In this article, we construct candidates for the corresponding extensions of Hodge structures, assuming that the sign of the functional equation of $L(φ,s)$ is $-1$. This is accomplished through the cohomology of variations of Hodge structures over Picard modular surfaces associated with $F$ and Harder's theory of Eisenstein cohomology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these extensions are naturally realized within certain biextensions. We outline a program to compute the biextension height and utilize it to establish the non-triviality of these extensions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $c>0$, let $X_c$ denote the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|<\frac{1}{cq^2}$ has only finitely many rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$. It is a classical fact, known since the 1950s, that $X_c$ is uncountable for $c>3$ and countable for $c<3$. However, the cardinality of $X_3$ does not appear to be present in the literature. We prove that $X_3$ is uncountable. More generally, we show that for any $n\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$, the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ with Lagrange value exactly $3$ and such that $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|<\frac{1}{3q^2}$ has exactly $n$ rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$ is also uncountable.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of lacunary trigonometric sums $S_n(ω) := \sum_{k=1}^n \cos (2 πa_k ω)$, $ω\in[0,1]$, and show that cumulant growth is highly sensitive to the arithmetic structure of the sequence $(a_k)_{k \geq 1}$ of positive integers. In particular, if $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_{k+1}/a_k = η> 1$ for some transcendental number $η$, we prove that for every $m\in \mathbb N$ the $m$-th cumulant of $S_n$ is asymptotically equivalent to the $m$-th cumulant of the ``independent model'' $\widetilde{S}_n := \sum_{k=1}^n \cos (2 πa_k U_k)$, where $U_1, U_2, \dots$ are independent random variables having uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. In particular, the order of growth of the cumulants as $n \to \infty$ is linear in this case. We also show that the transcendence condition for $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_{k+1}/a_k$ is in general necessary: when the ratio limit $η$ is algebraic, the cumulants of $S_n$ may have a different asymptotic order from those of $\widetilde{S}_n$. For instance, for $a_k = 2^k+1$ (with $η= 2$), the sixth cumulant of $S_n$ grows quadratically in $n$. In contrast, for $a_k = 2^k$ (again $η= 2$) or when $(a_k)_{k \geq 1}$ is the Fibonacci sequence (with $η= (1+\sqrt 5)/2$), the $m$-th cumulant of $S_n$ grows linearly as $n\to\infty$, but with a growth rate that differs from the one of the independent model $\widetilde{S}_n$. Overall, our results show that the asymptotic behavior of the cumulants of lacunary trigonometric sums depends on arithmetic effects in a very delicate way. This is particularly remarkable since many other probabilistic limit theorems, such as the Central Limit Theorem, hold for lacunary trigonometric sums in a universal way without any such sensitivity towards arithmetic effects.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish an explicit lower bound for the Néron-Tate height on elliptic curves with complex multiplication, for nontorsion points defined over the maximal abelian extension of a number field. Building on a strategy developed by Amoroso, David, and Zannier, we provide an alternative proof of a theorem originally due to Baker. The novelty in our approach is that it produces a lower bound that is fully explicit and independent of the discriminant of the base field.</p></details>

Let $\mathcal{W}$ be an additive complement of $\mathcal{S}$ and $$ f(n)=\#\big\{(w,m^2)\in \mathcal{W}\times \mathcal{S}: n=w+m^2\big\}. $$ It is proved that there is a positive constant $c_{\mathcal{W}}$ (depending at most on $\mathcal{W}$) such that $$ \sum_{n\le N}f(n)-N\ge c_{\mathcal{W}}N $$ for infinitely many positive integers $N$, which makes some progress on a 1993 conjecture of Cilleruelo. As consequences of the this result, we answer negatively a 2001 problem of Ruzsa as well as a 2017 problem of Ben Green.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide explicit formulas for quadratic Gauss sums over $\mathbb{Z}^n/c\mathbb{Z}^n$, which generalize some of the existing formulas, e.g., Skoruppa and Zagier's (for $n=2$), and Iwaniec and Kowalski's (for arbitrary $n$). We then give four main applications. As the first application, we prove a duality theorem, which relates a sum over a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}^n/c\mathbb{Z}^n$ to another sum over the orthogonal complement. This allows us to give explicit formulas for quadratic Gauss partial sums over certain subgroups. As the second application, we give an explicit formula for the coefficients of Weil representations of $\mathrm{Mp}_2(\mathbb{Z})$, which has the advantage, compared to Scheithauer's, Strömberg's, and Boylan and Skoruppa's formulas, that it involves neither local data nor limits of theta series. As the third application, we provide an explicit formula for the number of solutions of an arbitrary quadratic congruence in $n$ variables modulo a prime, as well as an efficient formula modulo a general integer. As the final application, we give a uniform formula for the number of solutions of the Diophantine equation $dxyz=Q(x,y,z)$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$, where $Q$ is an arbitrary integral quadratic form with some weak restrictions. This generalizes a result of Baragar regarding the Markoff equation. There is also a formula relating Hecke Gauss sums to sums over $\mathbb{Z}^n/c\mathbb{Z}^n$, an explicit formula for Hecke Gauss sums over quadratic fields, and an example of computing a Hecke Gauss sum over a cyclotomic field.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A quantum symmetric pair consists of a quantum group $\widetilde{\mathbf{U}}$ and its coideal subalgebra $\widetilde{\mathbf{U}}^\imath$. The Hall algebra constructions of $\widetilde{\mathbf{U}}$ and $\widetilde{\mathbf{U}}^\imath$ are given by Bridgeland and Lu--Wang, respectively. In this paper, we construct a Hall algebra framework for the coideal subalgebra structure of $\widetilde{\mathbf{U}}^\imath$ in $\widetilde{\mathbf{U}}$, and for the quantum symmetric pair $(\widetilde{\mathbf{U}},\widetilde{\mathbf{U}}^\imath)$. As an application, we prove that the natural embedding $\imath:\widetilde{\mathbf{U}}^\imath\to \widetilde{\mathbf{U}}$, and the coproduct $Δ:\widetilde{\mathbf{U}}^\imath\to \widetilde{\mathbf{U}}^\imath\otimes \widetilde{\mathbf{U}}$ preserve the integral forms of $\widetilde{\mathbf{U}}^\imath$ and $\widetilde{\mathbf{U}}$, which are used to construct the dual canonical bases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>About a century ago, P. A. MacMahon introduced a class of $q$-series, which are nowadays referred to as MacMahon series. More recently, in 2013, G. E. Andrews and S. C. F. Rose revealed the quasimodular property of these series. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of MacMahon series. Specifically, for any positive integers $t, k, N$ and a polynomial $Q(x)$, we define the series $\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}(Q; q)$ and $\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}^{\star}(Q; q)$ using the $N$-th cyclotomic polynomial. To investigate these series, we apply a decomposition formula involving the Eulerian polynomials and express the $N$-th roots of unity in terms of Gauss sums. By combining these results to derive explicit representations, we prove that our series arise as quasimodular forms of higher weight and higher level. Furthermore, we show that they can be expressed as isobaric polynomials. In particular, we show that the one-parameter generalization introduced by C. Nazaroglu, B. V. Pandey, and A. Singh arises as a special case of our theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper gives an algebraic presentation of an algebra called the fused permutations algebra in the one-boundary case. It is obtained through a detailed study of the degenerate cyclotomic Hecke algebra. In particular, we prove that the fused permutations algebra is a quotient of the degenerate cyclotomic affine Hecke algebra, and we also describe a basis combinatorially in terms of signed permutations with avoiding patterns. In order to understand this quotient, we study the primitive idempotents of this degenerate cyclotomic affine Hecke algebra.</p></details>
