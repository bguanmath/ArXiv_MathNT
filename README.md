<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime number. We compute the trivial source character tables of finite Frobenius groups $G$ with an abelian Frobenius complement $H$ and an elementary abelian Frobenius kernel of order $p^2$. More precisely, we deal with all infinite families of such groups which occur in the two extremal cases for the fusion of $p$-subgroups: the case in which there exists exactly one $G$-conjugacy class of non-trivial cyclic $p$-subgroups, and the case in which there exist exactly $p+1$ distinct $G$-conjugacy classes of non-trivial cyclic $p$-subgroups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently we introduced a new class of relations for Bernoulli symmetric polynomials. This manuscript shows that these relations are valid for arbitrary homogeneous symmetric polynomial. Analysis of these relations leads to the discovery of a new type of nonlinear relations for the Bernoulli numbers.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hans Jockers, Pyry Kuusela, Maik Sarve &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** hep-th &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Under certain assumptions, we show that unitary rational $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ conformal field theories together with a certain generating set of Cardy boundary states in the associated boundary conformal field theories give rise to rational Hodge structures of complex multiplication type. We argue that these rational Hodge structures for such rational conformal field theories arising from infrared fixed points of $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ non-linear sigma models with Calabi-Yau target spaces coincide with the rational Hodge structures of the middle-dimensional cohomology of the target space geometry. This gives non-trivial evidence of the general expectation in the literature that rational $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric conformal field theories associated to Calabi-Yau target spaces yield middle dimensional cohomological rational Hodge structures with complex multiplication. We exemplify our general results with the $\mathcal{N}=2$ A-type minimal model series - which do not have a geometric origin as a non-linear sigma model - and with two explicit $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ Gepner models that correspond to particular non-linear sigma models with specific Calabi-Yau threefold target spaces.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 64 pages. Comments and remarks welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a new proof of Alesker's Irreducibility Theorem. We first introduce a new localization technique for polynomial valuations on convex bodies, which we use to independently prove that smooth and translation invariant valuations are representable by integration with respect to the normal cycle. This allows us to reduce the statement to a corresponding result for the representation of $\mathfrak{sl}(n)$ on the space of these differential forms.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 84 pages, 49 figures. v5: revisions in Section 4. To appear in Inventiones Mathematicae

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Webs give a diagrammatic calculus for spaces of tensor invariants. We introduce hourglass plabic graphs as a new avatar of webs, and use these to give the first rotation-invariant $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_4)$-web basis, a long-sought object. The characterization of our basis webs relies on the combinatorics of these new plabic graphs and associated configurations of a symmetrized six-vertex model. We give growth rules, based on a novel crystal-theoretic technique, for generating our basis webs from tableaux and we use skein relations to give an algorithm for expressing arbitrary webs in the basis. We also discuss how previously known rotation-invariant web bases can be unified in our framework of hourglass plabic graphs.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25691v1'>2510.25691</a>\]&nbsp; **Positivity of partial sums of a random multiplicative function and corresponding problems for the Legendre symbol**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Petr Kucheriaviy &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f(n)$ be a random completely multiplicative function such that $f(p) = \pm 1$ with probabilities $1/2$ independently at each prime. We study the conditional probability, given that $f(p) = 1$ for all $p < y$, that all partial sums of $f(n)$ up to $x$ are nonnegative. We prove that for $y \ge C \frac{(\log x)^2 \log_2 x}{\log_3 x}$ this probability equals $1 - o(1)$. We also study the probability $P_x'$ that $\sum_{n \le x} \frac{f(n)}{n}$ is negative. We prove that $P_x' \ll \exp \left( - \exp \left( \frac{\log x \log_4 x}{(1 + o(1)) \log_3 x)} \right) \right)$, which improves a bound given by Kerr and Klurman. Under a conjecture closely related to Hal\'asz's theorem, we prove that $P_x' \ll \exp(-x^{\alpha})$ for some $\alpha > 0$. Let $\chi_p(n) = \left( \frac{n}{p} \right)$ be the Legendre symbol modulo $p$. For a prime $p$ chosen uniformly at random from $(x, 2x]$, we express the probability that all partial sums of $\frac{\chi_p(n)}{n}$ are nonnegative in terms of the same probability for a random completely multiplicative function $f$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define Hecke modifications of conformal blocks over affine Lie algebras at non-critical level by using the Hecke modifications of the underlying $G$-bundles. We show that this procedure is equivalent to the insertion of a twisted vacuum module at an additional marked point and provide an explicit description using coordinate transformations.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13091v2'>2410.13091</a>\]&nbsp; **Geometry of multidimensional Farey summation algorithm and frieze patterns**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Oleg Karpenkov, Matty van Son &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we develop a new geometric approach to subtractive continued fraction algorithms in high dimensions. We adapt a version of Farey summation to the geometric techniques proposed by F. Klein in 1895. More specifically we introduce Farey polyhedra and their sails that generalise respectively Klein polyhedra and their sails, and show similar duality properties of the Farey sail integer invariants. The construction of Farey sails is based on the multidimensional generalisation of the Farey tessellation provided by a modification of the continued fraction algorithm introduced by R. W. J. Meester. We classify Farey polyhedra in the combinatorial terms of prismatic diagrams. Prismatic diagrams extend boat polygons introduced by S. Morier-Genoud and V. Ovsienko in the two-dimensional case. As one of the applications of the new theory we get a multidimensional version of Conway-Coxeter frieze patterns. We show that multidimensional frieze patterns satisfy generalised Ptolemy relations.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Dang Vo Phuc &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AC &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 25 pages. We welcome any constructive discussions and comments

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the rank-4 case of the conjecture of Ha-Hai-Nghia for the invariant subspace of the truncated polynomial ring $\mathcal{Q}_m(n)=\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dots,x_n]/(x_1^{q^m},\dots,x_n^{q^m}),$ under a new, explicit technical hypothesis. Our argument extends the determinant calculus for the delta operator by deriving crucial rank-4 identities governing its interaction with the Dickson algebra. We show that the proof of the conjecture reduces to a specific vanishing property, for which we introduce a sufficient condition, the "matching hypothesis" ($\mathrm{H_{match}}$), relating the degree structures of Dickson invariants. This condition is justified by theoretical arguments and verified computationally in many cases. Combining this approach with the normalized derivation approach from our prior work, we establish the conjecture. As a result, the Lewis-Reiner-Stanton Conjecture is also confirmed for rank four under the given hypothesis.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We derive the canonical forms for a pair of $n\times n$ complex matrices $(E,Q)$ under transformations $(E,Q) \rightarrow (UEV,U^{-T}QV)$, and $(E,Q) \rightarrow (UEV,U^{-*}QV)$, where $U$ and $V$ are nonsingular complex matrices. We, in particular, consider the special cases of $E^TQ$ and $E^*Q$ being (skew-)symmetric and (skew-)Hermitian, respectively, that are associated with Lagrangian and Dirac subspaces and related linear-time invariant dissipative Hamiltonian descriptor systems.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Irmak Balçık &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 18 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $q$ be a prime with $q \geq 5$. We show that the average rank of elliptic curves over a function field $\mathbb{F}_{q}(t)$, when ordered by naive height, is bounded above by $25/14 \approx 1.8$. Our result improves the previous upper bound of $2.3$ proven by Brumer. The upper bound obtained is less than $2$, which shows that a positive proportion of elliptic curves has either rank $0$ or $1$. The proof adapts the work of Young, which shows that under the assumption of the General Riemann Hypothesis for $L$-functions of elliptic curves, the average rank for the family of elliptic curves over the rational numbers is bounded above by $ 25/14 \approx 1.8$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Cesar Cuenca, Maciej Dołęga &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.PR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** v2: 53 pages, 2 figures. The previous version has been split into two parts. Part II, titled "Crystallization of discrete N-particle systems at high temperature", which contains Section 6 from the previous version and new material, is available as a separate arXiv submission arXiv:2510.23496

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers for random discrete $N$-particle systems with the deformation (inverse temperature) parameter $\theta$, as their size $N$ tends to infinity simultaneously with the inverse temperature going to zero. Our conditions are expressed in terms of the Jack generating functions, and our analysis is based on the asymptotics of the action of Cherednik operators obtained via Hecke relations. We apply the general framework to obtain the LLN for a large class of Markov chains of $N$ nonintersecting particles with interaction of log-gas type, and the LLN for the multiplication of Jack polynomials, as the inverse temperature tends to zero. We express the answer in terms of novel one-parameter deformations of cumulants and their description provided by us recovers previous work by Bufetov--Gorin on quantized free cumulants when $\theta=1$, and by Benaych-Georges--Cuenca--Gorin after a deformation to continuous space of random matrix eigenvalues. Our methods are robust enough to be applied to the fixed temperature regime, where we recover the LLN of Huang.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The simple continued fractions for the Golden & Silver means are well-known. It is astonishing that, as far as we know, no one has published half-iterates (let alone quarter-iterates) for the corresponding algorithms. We also examine the cosine and logistic maps (with parameter $2 < \lambda < 3$).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Brauer groups of affine surfaces that are complements of singular hyperplane sections of smooth cubic surfaces over a field $k$ of characteristic $0$. We determine the Brauer group over the algebraic closure as a Galois module for all the possible singular hyperplane sections. For the case when the hyperplane section is geometrically the union of three lines, we give explicit examples where transcendental elements of order $2$ and $3$ exist over $\mathbb{Q}$. We end with an application on the integral Brauer-Manin obstruction to the integral Hasse principle.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In their study of Arthur's conjectures for real groups, Adams, Barbasch, and Vogan introduced the notion of micro-packets.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yixin Lan, Yumeng Wu, Jie Xiao &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>According to the Hall algebras of quivers with automorphisms under Lusztig's construction, the polynominal forms of several structure coefficients for quantum groups of all finite types are presented in this note. We first provide a geometric realization of the coefficients between PBW basis and the canonical basis via standard sheaves on quiver moduli spaces with admissible automorphisms. This realization is constructed through Lusztig sheaves equipped with periodic functors and their modified Grothendieck groups. Second, within this geometric framework, we present an alternative proof for the existence of Hall polynomials originally due to Ringel. Finally, we give a slight generalization of the Reineke-Caldero expression for the bar involution of PBW basis elements in symmetrizable cases. When the periodic functor $\mathbf{a}^*$ is taken $\mathrm{id}$, our results are the same as Lusztig's and Caldero-Reineke's.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let G be a connected split adjoint semi simple p-adic Lie group. This paper can be seen as a continuation of [12] and is about the construction of locally analytic G-representations which do not lie in the principal series. Here we consider locally analytic representations which are induced by Whittaker modules of the attached Lie algebra. We prove that they are inadmissible and topologically irreducible in case the Whittaker module is simple. On the other hand, we show that the naive Jacquet functor of these representations vanishes for all parabolic subgroups. However, they do not satisfy the definition of supercuspidality in the sense of Kohlhaase.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We state a lower bound for how often an irreducible monic cubic polynomial is a sum of two squares ($\square_{2}$). To do so, we rely on a two-dimensional unit argument, and degree six number fields. As an example we can show that if $h$ is an odd integer which is not a cube, then $\# \{n: \ n^3+h \in \square_{2}, \ 1 \leq n \leq x \} \gg x^{1/3-o(1)}$. Our arguments may be generalised to generate literature for how often an irreducible monic cubic polynomial is represented in the quadratic form $x^2+ny^2$, provided $n \in \mathbb{N}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Complete eigenstructure, e.g., eigenvalues with multiplicities and minimal indices, of a skew-symmetric matrix pencil may change drastically if the matrix coefficients of the pencil are subjected to (even small) perturbations. These changes can be investigated qualitatively by constructing the stratification (closure hierarchy) graphs of the congruence orbits of the pencils. The results of this paper facilitate the construction of such graphs by providing all closest neighbours for a given node in the graph. More precisely, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for one congruence orbit of a skew-symmetric matrix pencil, A, to belong to the closure of the congruence orbit of another pencil, B, such that there is no pencil, C, whose orbit contains the closure of the orbit of A and is contained in the closure of the orbit of B.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an associative algebra $A$ with a simple module $M$ with trivial endomorphisms and trivial annihilator we verify the countable separation property (CSP), i.e. we prove that there exists a list of nonzero elements $a_1, a_2,\ldots$ of $A$ such that every two-sided ideal of $A$ contains at least one such $a_i$. Based on this result we verify the countable separation property for a free associative algebra with finite or countable set of generators over any field. The countable separation property was studied before in the works of Dixmier and others but only in the context of Noetherian algebras (and a free associative algebra is very far from being Noetherian).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the representation theory of various convolution algebras attached to the $q$-deformation of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ from an algebraic perspective and beyond the unitary case. We show that many aspects of the classical representation theory of real semisimple groups can be transposed to this context. In particular, we prove an analogue of the Harish-Chandra isomorphism and we introduce an analogue of parabolic induction. We use these tools to to classify the (non-unitary) irreducible admissible representations of $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. Moreover, we explicitly show how these irreducible representations converge to the classical admissible dual of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. For that purpose, we define a version of the quantized universal enveloping algebra defined over the ring of analytic functions on $\mathbb{R}_+^*$, which specializes at $q = 1$ to the enveloping $\ast$-algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$ .</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Conjectures of Braverman and Kazhdan, Ng\^o and Sakellaridis have motivated the development of Schwartz spaces for certain spherical varieties. We prove that under suitable assumptions these Schwartz spaces are naturally a representation of a group that we christen the modulation group. This provides a broad generalization of the defining representation of the metaplectic group. The example of a vector space and the zero locus of a quadric cone in an even number of variables are discussed in detail. In both of these cases the modulation group is closely related to algebraic groups, and we propose a conjectural method of linking modulation groups to ind-algebraic groups in general. At the end of the paper we discuss adelization and the relationship between representations of modulation groups and the Poisson summation conjecture.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Haode Yan, Maosheng Xiong &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We employ analytic number theoretic techniques, specifically character sums and Weil type estimates, to study the covering radius of the generalized Zetterberg codes over all finite fields. Although the even and odd field cases require distinct technical treatment, the proofs follow a unified analytic framework that is substantially simpler and more transparent than previous approaches. We prove that the covering radius is at most 3 in all cases, and determine its exact value for a wide range of parameters. In even characteristic, our results fill the gap left by recent studies focused solely on odd characteristic; for odd characteristic, the range of parameters for which the covering radius is exactly determined is considerably broader than previously known. Combined with the corresponding minimum distance results, we obtain infinitely many quasi-perfect and maximal codes within this family.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an asymptotic formula with a power saving error term for the fourth moment of the family of Dirichlet $L$-functions to modulus $q$ mollified by a Dirichlet polynomial of length $q^{\frac1{22}-\ve}$, valid for all moduli $q\not\equiv2 \pmod 4$. This result was previously known only for restricted sets of moduli with smaller power savings. As a special case, when no Dirichlet polynomial is enclosed, this leads to a significant improvement on X.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that if a module M over a basic classical Lie superalgebra of type type I is simultaneously a Verma module with respect to some Borel \(\mathfrak b_1\) and a dual Verma module with respect to Borel \(\mathfrak b_2\), then M is isomorphic to a Verma module with respect to either distinguished or an anti-distinguished Borel. Our method proceeds by analyzing edge contractions of the finite Young lattice that controls the combinatorics of odd reflections. In principle, the same strategy, for the most part, applies to all basic classical Lie superalgebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the patching setting, given a factorization inverse system of fields over which patching for finite-dimensional vector spaces holds, together with a crossed module over the inverse limit field, the corresponding six-term Mayer--Vietoris sequence is constructed, generalizing the classical result of Harbater--Hartmann--Krashen for linear algebraic groups. When the crossed module is a two-term complex of tori, the above sequence is extended into a nine-term exact sequence, notably without any assumption on global domination of Galois cohomology of the inverse system. To this end, we develop a theory of (co-)flasque resolutions for short complexes of tori which is built on the work of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Sansuc. As an application, we show that patching holds for nonabelian second Galois cohomology of reductive groups with smooth centers. We then obtain a weak local--global principle for this cohomology set in the simply connected semisimple case. We also rediscover a well-known local--global principle for indices of central simple algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates Srinivasa Ramanujan's initial intuitive methodology for assigning the finite value -1/12 to the sum of the divergent infinite series of all positive integers. We systematically examine Ramanujan's initial method, originally sketched in his notebooks, and set the methodology into an algebraic framework. The methodology has limited applicability to other classes of divergent series. The methodology is extended to assign a Ramanujan smoothed sum to the infinite sequences of integers raised to a positive integer power and to figurate binomial number sequences, including triangular numbers, tetrahedral numbers, and higher-dimensional analogues, avoiding analytical continuation. A key finding establishes that the Ramanujan smoothed sums of figurate binomial sequences are intrinsically connected to logarithmic numbers (Gregory coefficients), providing a novel perspective on Ramanujan summation through the lens of classical combinatorial functions. The paper applies asymptotic expansions of associated rational generating functions to demonstrate consistency with established results from analytic continuation methods. The results illuminate the deeper mathematical structures underlying Ramanujan's intuitive insights and suggest new avenues for research in divergent series summation.</p></details>

We show that the quotient $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]/I_{n,m,r}$ admits a standard monomial basis, which is determined by extending rook placements to an element in $\mathfrak{S}_{n+m-r}$ and applying Viennot's shadow line avatar of the Schensted correspondence.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $ G = \mathbb{Z}/r\mathbb{Z}$ be the cyclic group of order $r$, and let $\varpi = e^{2\pi i / r}$ denote a primitive $r$ th root of unity. Consider the action of $G$ on $\mathbb{C}^n$ via the embedding $$ \varphi : G \hookrightarrow GL_n(\mathbb{C}), \qquad \varphi(1) = \mathrm{diag}\!\bigl( \underbrace{\varpi, \dots, \varpi}_{s},\, \underbrace{\varpi^{-1}, \dots, \varpi^{-1}}_{n - s} \bigr), $$ where $0 < s < n $. Denote the corresponding GIT quotient by $$ \mathcal{X}_{s,n,r} = \mathrm{Spec}\bigl((\mathbb{C}[z_1,\dots,z_n])^G\bigr). $$ Then the varieties $\mathcal{X}_{s,n,r}$ is a cyclic quotient singularity of type $\tfrac{1}{r}\bigl(\underbrace{1,\dots,1}_{s}, \underbrace{-1,\dots,-1}_{n-s}\bigr)$. We show that the associated $G$-Hilbert schemes $\mathcal{Y}_{s,n,r}$ are smooth, connected, and irreducible. The natural morphism $$ \rho_{s,n,r}:\mathcal{Y}_{s,n,r}\longrightarrow\mathcal{X}_{s,n,r} $$ is a projective resolution of $\mathcal{X}_{s,n,r}$, discrepant for $n \ge 3$. We establish that the irreducible components of the central fiber $\rho_{s,n,r}^{-1}(0)$ are in bijection with the nontrivial characters of \(G\), thereby realizing the classical McKay correspondence in this family of examples. Finally, we describe a canonical choice of this bijection via the Fourier--Mukai type functor $$ \Psi : D^b(\mathrm{Coh}_G(\mathbb{C}^n)) \longrightarrow D^b(\mathrm{Coh}(\mathcal{Y}_{s,n,r})), $$ by showing that, for each nontrivial irreducible representation of $G$, the corresponding skyscraper sheaf is mapped to a complex whose $0^{\text{th}}$ cohomology is supported on a unique irreducible component of the central fiber $\rho_{s,n,r}^{-1}(0)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Classical studies of the Fibonacci sequence focus on its periodicity modulo m (the Pisano periods) with canonical initialization. We investigate instead the complete periodic structure arising from all m^2 possible initializations in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. We discover perfect chiral symmetry between the Fibonacci recurrence $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and its parity transform $a_n = -a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$, and observe fractal self-similarity in the extension from prime to prime power moduli. Additionally, we classify prime moduli due to their periodicity, and show that they exhibit weight preservation under modular extension. Furthermore, we define a minima distribution $P(n)$ governed by Lucas ratios, which satisfies the symmetric relation $P(n)=P(1-n)$. For cyclotomic recurrences, we conjecture explicit counting functions for the number of distinct periods, with connections to necklace enumeration. These findings suggest potential links to Viswanath's random recurrence, modular forms and $L$-functions.</p></details>

If $k$ is not algebraically closed, there might not exist an ample line bundle on $A$ defined over $k$ that represents $\lambda$. To remedy this, Poonen and Stoll have asked the following question: does there exist a line bundle on an $A$-torsor that represents $\lambda$? We give a criterion for the existence of such a torsor and line bundle which only depends on the kernel of $\lambda$. Using this criterion, we show that the answer to the question is yes when the polarization has odd or small even degree. On the other hand, we show that for every $g\geq 7$, there exists a polarized $g$-dimensional abelian variety for which the answer to the question is no.</p></details>

As an application we answer a question of Gros-Kaneda about the multiplcity of $\mathscr{L}(-\rho)$ as a direct summand of $\mathsf{F}_{*}\mathscr{O}_{G/B}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a theory of primitive pairs for $\mathbb{Z}$-graded Lie algebras when the sheaves have coefficients in a field $\Bbbk$ of positive characteristic, providing a graded analogue of the role played by cuspidal pairs in the generalized Springer correspondence. We consider the centralizer $G_0$ of a fixed cocharacter $\chi$ in a connected, reductive, algebraic group $G$ and its action on the eigenspaces $\mathfrak{g}_n$ of $\chi$. Building on the framework of parity sheaves and the Fourier transform established in \cite{Ch,Ch1}, we show that every indecomposable parity sheaf on $\mathfrak{g}_n$ can be expressed as a direct summand of a complex induced from primitive data on a Levi subgroup. This result extends the fact that, in the graded setting, any indecomposable parity sheaf is direct summand of an induced cuspidal datum \cite{Ch}. This confirms the organizing role of primitive pairs in the block decomposition of the category of $G_0$-equivariant parity sheaves on $\mathfrak{g}_n$. We further establish that primitive pairs on the nilpotent cone induce primitive pairs in the graded setting, and we prove that primitivity is preserved under the Fourier--Sato transform. These results reveal a deep compatibility between the geometry of graded Lie algebras and their representation-theoretic structures, forming the foundation for a graded version of the generalized Springer correspondence in positive characteristic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $U$ be a tensor product of highest weight modules of $GL_n(\mathbb C)$ corresponding to multiples of fundamental weights (i.e. rectangles). We consider three ways to stratify $U^{\otimes k}$ into components: using isotypic components of the cyclic action on tensor factors, using a generalization of the charge statistic, and using certain generalizations of Assaf's dual equivalence graphs. We conjecture that all three ways coincide, and we prove that the latter two ways coincide. The Kirillov-Reshetikhin dual equivalence graphs (KR DEGs) we introduce for this purpose are defined on $0$-weight spaces of tensor products of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals. They generalize Kazhdan-Lusztig dual equivalence graphs (KL DEGs) that previously appeared in the study of Kazhdan-Lusztig cells in affine type A. While the tensor products of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals are connected as affine crystals, the KR DEGs in general are not.</p></details>

We also give a combinatorial description of the embedding from the crystal of a $q$-oscillator representation to that of the negative half subalgebra given in terms of a PBW type basis. It is given as a composition of embeddings into the crystals of intermediate parabolic Verma modules, where the most non-trivial one is from an oscillator module to a maximally parabolic Verma module with respect to a quantum subsuperalgebra for $\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n}$. A new crystal theoretic realization of Burge correspondence of orthosymplectic type plays an important role for the description of this embedding.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We make a systematic study of duality phenomena in tensor-triangular geometry, generalising and complementing previous results of Balmer--Dell'Ambrogio--Sanders and Dwyer--Greenlees--Iyengar. A key feature of our approach is the use of proxy-smallness to remove assumptions on functors preserving compact objects, and to this end we introduce proxy-small geometric functors and establish their key properties. Given such a functor, we classify the rigid objects in its associated torsion category, giving a new perspective on results of Benson--Iyengar--Krause--Pevtsova. As a consequence, we show that any proxy-small geometric functor satisfies Grothendieck duality on a canonical subcategory of objects, irrespective of whether its right adjoint preserves compact objects. We use this as a tool to classify Matlis dualising objects and to provide a suitable generalisation of the Gorenstein ring spectra of Dwyer--Greenlees--Iyengar in tensor-triangular geometry. We illustrate the framework developed with various examples and applications, showing that it captures Matlis duality and Gorenstein duality in commutative algebra, duality phenomena in chromatic and equivariant stable homotopy theory, and Watanabe's theorem in polynomial invariant theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a monoidal equivalence, called universal Koszul duality, between genuine equivariant K-motives on a Kac-Moody flag variety and constructible monodromic sheaves on its Langlands dual. The equivalence is obtained by a Soergel-theoretic description of both sides which extends results for finite-dimensional flag varieties by Taylor and the first author. Universal Koszul duality bundles together a whole family of equivalences for each point of a maximal torus. At the identity, it recovers an ungraded version of Beilinson-Ginzburg-Soergel's and Bezrukavnikov-Yun's Koszul duality for equivariant and unipotently monodromic sheaves. It also generalizes Soergel-theoretic descriptions for monodromic categories on finite-dimensional flag varieties by Lusztig-Yun, Gouttard and the second author. For affine Kac-Moody groups, our work sheds new light on the conjectured quantum Satake equivalences by Cautis-Kamnitzer and Gaitsgory. On our way, we establish foundations on six functors for reduced K-motives and introduce a formalism of constructible monodromic sheaves.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Northcott and Bogomolov property for special values of Dedekind $\zeta$-functions at real values $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}$. We prove, in particular, that the Bogomolov property is not satisfied when $\sigma \geq \frac{1}{2}$. If $\sigma > 1$, we produce certain families of number fields having arbitrarily large degrees, whose Dedekind $\zeta$-functions $\zeta_K(s)$ attain arbitrarily small values at $s = \sigma$. On the other hand, if $\frac{1}{2} \leq \sigma \leq 1$, we construct suitable families of quadratic number fields, employing either Soundararajan's resonance method, which works when $\frac{1}{2} \leq \sigma < 1$, or results on random Euler products by Granville and Soundararajan, and by Lamzouri, which work when $\frac{1}{2} < \sigma \leq 1$. We complete the study by proving that the Dedekind $\zeta$ function together with the degree satisfies the Northcott property for every complex $s\in{\mathbb{C}}$ such that $\mathrm{Re}(s) <0$, generalizing previous work of G\'en\'ereux and Lal\'in.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the cohomology of a chiral supercharge $Q$ in the $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory at tree level. The cohomology classes correspond one-to-one to the $\frac1{16}$ Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) states at one-loop. We argue that monotone classes on the Coulomb branch respect the S-duality between the theories with $\mathrm{SO}(2N+1)$ and $\mathrm{USp}(2N)$ gauge groups, but find an explicit example of a pair of cohomology classes that "violate" the S-duality in the sense that the tree-level $Q$-cohomologies are not isomorphic between the neighborhoods near the two free points. Within this pair, one is a fortuitous class and the other is a monotone chiral ring element. Assuming the non-perturbative validity of S-duality, our results disprove a long-standing conjecture on the one-loop exactness of the $\frac1{16}$-BPS spectrum (including the $\frac1{8}$-BPS chiral ring spectrum) in the $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. Mathematically, this shows that, the relative Lie algebra cohomology $H^\bullet(\mathfrak{g}[A],\mathfrak{g})$ is generally not graded-isomorphic to $H^\bullet({}^L\mathfrak{g}[A],{}^L\mathfrak{g})$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ and ${}^L\mathfrak{g}$ are a pair of Langlands dual Lie algebras and $A=\mathbb{C}[z^+,z^-]\otimes\Lambda(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider generalisations of the elliptic Calogero--Moser systems associated to complex crystallographic groups in accordance to [1]. In our previous work [2], we proposed these systems as candidates for Seiberg--Witten integrable systems of certain SCFTs. Here we examine that proposal for complex crystallographic groups of rank one. Geometrically, this means considering elliptic curves $T^2$ with $\mathbb{Z}_m$-symmetries, $m=2,3,4,6$, and Poisson deformations of the orbifolds $(T^2\times\mathbb{C})/\mathbb{Z}_m$. The $m=2$ case was studied in [2], while $m=3,4,6$ correspond to Seiberg--Witten integrable systems for the rank 1 Minahan--Nemeshansky SCFTs of type $E_{6,7,8}$. This allows us to describe the corresponding elliptic fibrations and the Seiberg--Witten differential in a compact elegant form. This approach also produces quantum spectral curves for these SCFTs, which are given by Fuchsian ODEs with special properties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Intrinsic volumes are fundamental geometric invariants generalizing volume, surface area, and mean width for convex bodies. We establish a unified Laplace-Grassmannian representation for intrinsic and dual volumes of convex polynomial sublevel sets. More precisely, let $f$ be a convex $d$-homogeneous polynomial of even degree $d \ge 2$ which is positive except at the origin. We show that the intrinsic and dual volumes of the sublevel set $[f \le 1]$ admit Laplace-type integral formulas obtained by averaging the infimal projection and restriction of $f$ over the Grassmannian. This explicit representation yields three main consequences: (1) L\"owner--John-type existence and uniqueness results extending beyond the classical volume case; (2) a block decomposition principle describing factorization of intrinsic volumes under direct-sum splitting; (3) a coordinate-free formulation of Lipschitz-type lattice discrepancy bounds. These formulas enable analytic treatment of a broad class of geometric quantities, providing direct access to variational and arithmetic applications as well as new structural insights.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski-dense subgroup of a reductive group $\mathbf{G}$ defined over a field $F$. Given a finite collection of finite subgroups $H_i$ ($i \in I$) of $\mathbf{G}(F)$ avoiding the center, we establish a criterion to ensure that the set of elements of $\Gamma$ that form a free product with every $H_i$ (the so-called simultaneous ping-pong partners for $H_i$) is both Zariski- and profinitely dense in $\Gamma$. This criterion applies namely to direct products $\mathbf{G}$ of inner $\mathbb{R}$-forms of $\mathrm{(P)GL}_n$, and gives a positive answer to this particular case of a question asked by Bekka, Cowling and de la Harpe. For torsion elements, a complication arises due to the fact that a finite cyclic group can split into a direct product. When $\mathbf{G}$ is the multiplicative group of a semisimple algebra, we also give a more explicit method to obtain free products between two given finite subgroups, via first-order deformations. In the second half, we investigate the case where $\mathbf{G}$ is the multiplicative group of the group algebra $FG$ of a finite group $G$, and $\Gamma$ is the group of units of an order in $FG$. In this regard, we prove that the set of bicylic units that play ping-pong with a given shifted bicyclic unit, is Zariski- and profinitely dense, addressing a long-standing belief in the field of group rings. This result is deduced from the criterion above, combined with sharp existence results for well-behaved irreducible representations of $G$ that are center-preserving on a given subgroup.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Version 2: Includes results on dual invariant

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate structural properties of finite groups that are detected by certain group invariants arising from Dijkgraaf--Witten theory, a topological quantum field theory, in one space and one time dimension. In this setting, each finite group $G$ determines a family of numerical invariants associated with closed orientable surfaces, expressed in terms of the degrees of the complex irreducible characters of $G$. These invariants can be viewed as natural extensions of the commuting probability $d(G)$, which measures the likelihood that two randomly chosen elements of $G$ commute and has been extensively studied in the literature. By analyzing these higher-genus analogues, we establish new quantitative criteria relating the values of these invariants to key structural features of finite groups, such as commutativity, nilpotency, supersolvability and solvability. Our results generalize several classical theorems concerning the commuting probability, thereby linking ideas from finite group theory and topological quantum field theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop representation theory of general linear groups in the category $\text{Ver}_4^+$, the simplest tensor category which is not Frobenius exact. Since $\text{Ver}_4^+$ is a reduction of the category of supervector spaces to characteristic $2$ (by a result of Venkatesh, arXiv:1507.05142), these groups may be viewed as general linear supergroups in characteristic $2$. More precisely, every object in $\text{Ver}_4^+$ has the form $m\mathbf{1}+nP$ where $P$ is the indecomposable projective, and $\text{GL}(m\mathbf{1}+nP)$ is the reduction to characteristic $2$ of $\text{GL}(m+n|n)$. We explicitly describe the irreducible representations of $\text{GL}(P)$ and then use this description to classify the irreducible representations of $\text{GL}(m\mathbf{1}+nP)$ for general $m,n$. We also define some subgroups of $\text{GL}(m\mathbf{1}+nP)$ and classify their irreducible representations. Finally, we conjecture a Steinberg tensor product theorem for $\text{Ver}_4^+$ involving the square of the Frobenius map.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that, given the Balmer spectrum of any essentially small monoidal-triangulated category, one has a classification of semiprime thick tensor ideals arising in terms of a "pseudo-Hochster-dual" of the noncommutative Balmer spectrum. This extends Balmer's classification of radical thick tensor ideals to noncommutative tensor-triangular geometry. To achieve this, we utilize the notion of support data for lattices and frames, under which the classification is a consequence of Stone duality. We also give a characterization for when the noncommutative Balmer spectrum behaves as it does in tensor-triangular geometry, that is, when it is a spectral space with quasi-compact opens given by complements of supports, and show that rigid centrally generated monoidal-triangulated categories satisfy this property.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct Grothendieck topologies on the path category of a finite graph, examining both coarse and discrete cases that offer different perspectives on quiver representations. The coarse topology declares each vertex covered by all incoming morphisms, giving the minimal non-trivial Grothendieck topology where sheaves correspond to dual representations via dualization. The discrete topology is the finest possible, forcing sheaves to be locally constant with isomorphic restriction maps. We verify these satisfy Grothendieck's axioms, characterize their sheaf categories, and establish functorial relationships between them. Sheaves on the coarse site arise naturally from quiver representations through dualization, while discrete sheaves correspond to representations of the groupoid completion. This work suggests intermediate topologies could capture subtler representation-theoretic phenomena.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Rooted trees are essential for describing numerical schemes via the so-called B-series. They have also been used extensively in rough analysis for expanding solutions of singular Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs). When one considers scalar-valued equations, the most efficient combinatorial set is multi-indices. In this paper, we investigate the existence of intermediate combinatorial sets that will lie between multi-indices and rooted trees. We provide a negative result stating that there is no combinatorial set encoding elementary differentials in dimension $d\neq 1$, and compatible with the rooted trees and the multi-indices aside from the rooted trees. This does not close the debate of the existence of such combinatorial sets, but it shows that it cannot be obtained via a naive and natural approach.</p></details>

We find a wide family of the Gibbs measures, parameterized by certain analytic functions. A subset of our measures have probabilistic interpretation as interacting particle systems with fixed particles speeds. In contrast to previous related boundary problems, we find that admissible speeds are not arbitrary, but must be larger than $\frac{p}{1-p}$. For this subset we further establish Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem, connecting the fluctuations to families of independent GUE eigenvalues.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we consider recurrence sequences $x_n=\xi_1 \alpha_1^n+\xi_2 \alpha_2^n$ ($n=0,1,\ldots$) with companion polynomial $P(X)$. For example, the sequence $x_n=\xi_1(4+\sqrt{2})^n+\xi_2(4-\sqrt{2})^n$ satisfies the recurrence $x_{n+2}-8x_{n+1}+14x_n=0$ and has companion polynomial $P(X)=X^2-8X+14=(X-4-\sqrt{2})(X-4+\sqrt{2})$. We call $(\xi_1,\xi_2)$ normal with respect to the recurrence relation determined by $P(X)$ when $(x_n)_{n\ge 0}$ is uniformly distributed modulo one. Determining the Borel complexity of the set of normal vectors for a fixed recurrence sequence is unresolved even for most geometric progressions. Under certain assumptions, we prove that the set of normal vectors is $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_3^0$-complete. A special case is the new result that the sets of numbers normal in base $\alpha$, i.e. $\{\xi\in \mathbb{R}\mid (\xi\alpha^n)_{n\geq 0}\mbox{ is u.d. modulo one.} \}$, are $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_3^0$-complete for every real number $\alpha$ with $|\alpha|$ Pisot. We analyze the fractional parts of recurrence sequences in terms of finite words via certain numeration systems. One of the difficulties in proving the main result is that even when recurrence sequences are uniformly distributed modulo one, it is not known what the average frequencies of the digits in the corresponding digital expansions are or if they even must exist.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate variations of Selmer ranks under quadratic twists satisfying the Heegner hypothesis. In particular, starting with an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ with partial $2$-torsion and a common relaxed Selmer group, we derive explicit formulae describing the effect of twisting on Selmer ranks in terms of matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{2}$. As an application, we show that these formulae are compatible with predictions made by the parity conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an explicit surjectivity result for products of non-isotrivial, non-isogenous elliptic curves over a function field of arbitrary characteristic. This is by way of an isogeny degree bound in this setting, generated from bounds for elliptic curves by Griffon--Pazuki, and techniques originated by Serre and Masser--W\"{u}stholz in the number field setting. We apply our result to prove that most members of a family of products of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ with no extra endomorphisms have no exceptional primes above a specified constant which depends neither on the elliptic curve factors nor on the dimension of the product.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we give a geometric model for non-homogeneous tubes of the cluster category of the affine type $D$. This model is given in terms of homotopy classes of unoriented arcs in the twice punctured disk. In particular, we extend the geometric model for the tube of rank $n-2$ given in arXiv:2407.11232 to the two tubes of rank $2$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 77 pages. v3: The abstract and the introduction were rewritten. "Main Speculation" in the previous version is now called a conjecture. Proposition 4.5 has been added. The nefness of raised line bundle was defined and added in the assumptions of the conjecture

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a new framework for studying the distribution of rational points on DM stacks of positive characteristic. Our primary focus is on wild stacks, which existing frameworks do not address. There was not even a satisfactory notion of heights for such stacks. First, we introduce a new kind of height function that extends the authors' idea from their preceding paper on characteristic-zero stacks. This new height function is more general and flexible than the previous one. Examples of the new height function include discriminants of torsors, minimal discriminants, and conductors of elliptic curves in characteristic three. Next, we formulate a generalization of the Batyrev-Manin conjecture for rational points of DM stacks in positive characteristic relative to this new type of height function. We provide several pieces of evidence for this generalization.</p></details>
