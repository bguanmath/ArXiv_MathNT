 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ryan Alweiss &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DS &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that there is a set which is not a set of multiple recurrence despite being a set of recurrence for nil-Bohr sets. This answers Huang, Shao, and Ye's \enquote{higher-order} version of Katznelson's Question on Bohr recurrence and topological recurrence in the negative. Equivalently, we construct a set $S$ so that there is a finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ without three-term arithmetic progressions with common differences in $S$, but so that $S$ lacks the usual polynomial obstacles to arithmetic progressions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nicholas Davidson, Jonathan R. Kujawa, Robert Muth &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb{k}$ be a characteristic zero domain. We define and study a diagrammatic monoidal $\mathbb{k}$-linear supercategory $\mathbf{Web}^{aff}_{A}$ associated to any locally unital Frobenius $\mathbb{k}$-superalgebra $A$. This category can be viewed variously as an affinization of the finite web category $\mathbf{Web}_{A}$ previously defined by the authors and Zhu, as a thickening of the degenerate affine wreath product algebras defined by Savage, or as a Frobenius deformation of affine web categories defined by Song and Wang. We show that there is an asymptotically faithful family of functors from $\mathbf{Web}^{aff}_{A}$ to the monoidal supercategory of endofunctors of $\mathfrak{gl}_n(A)$-modules for every $n \geq 1$, and use this to establish a basis of `decorated double coset diagrams' for morphism spaces in $\mathbf{Web}^{aff}_{A}$. We also define and establish basis results for the cyclotomic quotient category $\mathbf{Web}^Λ_{A}$ associated with a cyclotomic datum $Λ$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Samuel Goodman &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 19 pages, improved results

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a given positive integer $n$ and $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ a finite extension of ramification degree $e$, we determine the number of finite Galois extensions $L/K$ with inertia degree $f$ and a single nonnegative ramification jump at $n$ as long as $(p,e)$ is outside of a finite set. This builds upon the tamely ramified case, which is a classical consequence of Serre's Mass Formula, exhibiting a more restrictive behavior than in the tamely ramified case because the degrees of such extensions are bounded. We do this by working in a fixed Lubin-Tate extension and exploiting the surjectivity of a map corresponding to the ramification jump to reconstruct the $U^1$ part of the norm subgroup (coming from local class field theory) from its fibers and then by understanding how the fibers interact by studying them in terms of properties of the formal logarithm and partitions.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06401v3'>2411.06401</a>\]&nbsp; **The hyperbolic cover of an elliptic Weyl group**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Barbara Baumeister, Patrick Wegener &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study in detail the hyperbolic covers $\tilde{W}$ and $\hat{W}$ of an elliptic Weyl system introduced by Saito. We show that they are isomorphic and also isomorphic to an extended Coxeter system of star type. For $\tilde{c}$ a Coxeter transformation in $\tilde{W}$ we can conclude the Hurwitz transitivity of the braid group action on the set of reduced reflection factorizations of $\tilde{c}$ from the Hurwitz transitivity in extended Coxeter systems of star type. This then enables us to establish for a weighted projective line $\mathbb{X}$ of tubular type an order preserving bijection between the poset of thick subcategories of $\mathrm{coh}(\mathbb{X})$ generated by an exceptional sequence and the poset $[\mathrm{id}, \tilde{c}]$ ordered by the absolute order. In an Appendix, we study the hyperbolic cover of a Coxeter system.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X$ be a K3 or Enriques surface with good reduction. Let $G$ be a finite group acting (not necessarily linearly) on $X$. We give a criterion for this group action to extend to a smooth model of $X$ in terms of the action of $G$ on the second $\ell$-adic cohomology groups. In particular, we generalize the result on the extendability of Galois actions on K3 surfaces by Chiarellotto, Lazda, and Liedtke. As an application, we prove that a symplectic linear group action is extendable if the residue characteristic does not divide its order. Lastly, we relate the good reduction of Enriques surfaces with that of their K3 double covers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine the ring structure of the torus-equivariant cohomology of rank-one juggling varieties with rational coefficients. By realizing these varieties as cyclic quiver Grassmannians, we construct a Knutson--Tao type basis for their equivariant cohomology. Using this basis, we give an explicit description of the ring structure in terms of generators and relations, and compute the corresponding structure constants. Finally, we show that these structure constants are integral.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this document we let $U$ be a smooth variety of pure dimension $d$ over a local field $k_v$ with unit ball $\mathcal{O}_v$ and residue field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p>0$ and we set $n$ to be a positive integer such that $p\nmid n$. For various $u\in U(k_v)$ we study the evaluation map $u^*:\mathrm{H}^2(U,μ_n)\to \mathrm{H}^2(k_v,μ_n)$. We suppose that $U$ embeds as an open subscheme in a regular scheme $\mathcal{X}$ that is of finite type over $\mathcal{O}_v$. We assume that $Z:=\mathcal{X}\setminus U$ is a divisor and we endow it with its reduced scheme structure. We show that for $u_1,u_2\in U(k_v)$ that lift to $x_1,x_2\in \mathcal{X}(\mathcal{O}_v)$ we obtain the same evaluation map $u_1^*=u_2^*$ under the two conditions that first, there is an equality of reductions $\overline{x_1}=\overline{x_2}$ in $\mathcal{X}(\mathbb{F})$ and second, that $\mathrm{cl}(x_1\cap Z)=\mathrm{cl}(x_2\cap Z)$ holds in $\mathrm{H}^{2d}_{|\overline{x}|}(Z,μ_n^{\otimes d})$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 9 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As an extension of the classical irreducibility result of Dumas, a factorization result for polynomials over any valued field with a Krull valuation of arbitrary rank is proved. Further, a lower degree factor bound on factors of a given polynomial over a valued field with a Krull valuation is proved. These factorization results not only unify several known irreducibility results for polynomials over the said domains but also provide us sharp bounds on degrees of irreducible factors of the underlying polynomials.</p></details>

We then use this to bound strict Selmer groups under standard hypotheses. In addition, our approach gives a way of extending the $\mathrm{GSp}(4)\times\mathrm{GL}(2)$ Euler system of Hsu-Jin-Sakamoto to a motivic statement which also covers certain small weights omitted in op.cit..</p></details>

> **Comment:** 29 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an additive category and let $T\colon \mathcal{A}\rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ be an additive functor equipped with a natural transformation $ω\colon \mathrm{Id}_{\mathcal{A}}\rightarrow T$. We prove that the homotopy category of $n$-fold matrix factorizations of $ω$, denoted ${\rm HFact}_{n}(\mathcal{A},T,ω)$, admits a natural structure of a right triangulated category. In particular, when $T$ is an automorphism, the homotopy category ${\rm HFact}_{n}(\mathcal{A},T,ω)$ becomes triangulated. Furthermore, if $\mathcal{A}$ is a Frobenius exact category and $T$ is an autoequivalence, we obtain that the category ${\rm Fact}_{n}(\mathcal{A},T,ω)$ of $n$-fold $(\mathcal{A},T)$-factorizations of $ω$ is a Frobenius exact category. Consequently, the stable category of the Frobenius exact category ${\rm Fact}_{n}(\mathcal{A},T,ω)$ is a triangulated category.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Daewoong Cheong, Gennian Ge, Doowon Koh, Thang Pham, Dung The Tran, Tao Zhang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** V2: typos fixed, ready for submission

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a set $E \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$, the distance set is defined as $Δ(E) := \{\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\| : \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in E\}$, where $\|\cdot\|$ denotes the standard quadratic form. We investigate the Erdős--Falconer distance problem within the flexible class of $(u, s)$--Salem sets introduced by Jonathan M. Fraser, with emphasis on the even case $u = 4$. By exploiting the exact identity between $\|\widehat{E}\|_4$ and the fourth additive energy $Λ_4(E)$, we prove that quantitative gains in $Λ_4(E)$ force the existence of many distances. In particular, for a $(4, s)$--Salem set $E\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ with $d \geq 2$, if $$ |E|\gg q^{\min\left\{\frac{d+2}{4s+1}, \frac{d+4}{8s}\right\}}, $$ then $E$ determines a positive proportion of all distances. This strictly improves Fraser's threshold of $\frac{d}{4s}$ and the Iosevich-Rudnev bound of $q^{\frac{d+1}{2}}$ in certain parameter ranges. As applications, we obtain improved thresholds for multiplicative subgroups and sets on arbitrary varieties, and establish a sharp incidence bound for Salem sets that is of independent interest in incidence geometry. Moreover, our methods give sharp lower bounds for the number of distinct distances determined by two different sets. We also propose a unified conjecture for $(4, s)$--Salem sets that reconciles known bounds and pinpoints the odd-dimensional sphere regime: in odd dimensions $d \geq 3$, the often-cited $\frac{d-1}{2}$ threshold does not follow without additional structures. This provides a clear picture of the spherical distance conjecture.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Thang Pham, Semin Yoo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Final version, 39 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ and $B$ be sets in a finite vector space. In this paper, we study the magnitude of the set $A\cap f(B)$, where $f$ runs through a set of transformations. More precisely, we will focus on the cases that the set of transformations is given by orthogonal matrices or orthogonal projections. We prove that if $A, B\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ satisfy some natural conditions, then, for almost every $g\in O(d)$, there are at least $\gg q^d$ elements $z\in \mathbb{F}_q^d$ such that $$|A\cap (g(B)+z)| \sim \frac{|A||B|}{q^d}.$$ This implies that $|A-gB|\gg q^d$ for almost every $g\in O(d)$. In the flavor of expanding functions, with $|A|\le |B|$, we also show that the image $A-gB$ grows exponentially. In two dimensions, the result simply says that if $|A|=q^x$ and $|B|=q^y$, as long as $0<x\le y<2$, then for almost every $g\in O(2)$, we can always find $ε=ε(x, y)>0$ such that $|A-gB|\gg |B|^{1+ε}$. To prove these results, we need to develop new and robust incidence bounds between points and rigid motions by using a number of techniques including algebraic methods and discrete Fourier analysis. Our results are essentially sharp in odd dimensions. In the prime field plane, we further employ recent $L^2$ distance bounds and point-line/plane incidence machinery to derive improvements. Notable applications include a strong prime field analogue of a question of Mattila related to the Falconer distance problem, the Rotational Erdős-Falconer distance problem, and a quadratic expansion law. Taken together, the results in this paper present a robust two-way link between intersection phenomena and distance problems over finite fields, with dimension-uniform consequences and sharpness in several ranges.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** V. V. Bavula &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 16 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2509.01779; text overlap with arXiv:2509.01284

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is a finishing touch to the (over 200 years) {\em classical} `Galois Theory' of {\em arbitrary} finite field extensions, i.e. the goal of it is to describe intermediate subfields of an arbitrary finite field extension via {\em invariants} of `natural/obvious' objects that are associated with subfields via two Galois-type correspondences. The classical Galois Theory covers the case of finite Galois field extensions. For finite Galois field extensions the objects are their Galois groups and their invariants. In \cite{GaloisTh-RingThAp}, we introduce a new (ring theoretic) approach to the Galois Theory which is based on the {\em principle of maximal symmetry}. In \cite{AnGaloisTh-NORMAL-Fields}, the maximal symmetry of {\em normal} finite field extensions yields an analogue of the Galois Theory for them. For a normal finite field extension $L/K$ the `natural/obvious' objects are the subalgebra $\CD (L/K)\rtimes G(L/K)$ of $\End (L/K)$ that is generated by the automorphism group $G(L/K)$ and the algebra $\CD (L/K)$ of differential operators on $L/K$ and its `invariants'. The `maximal symmetry' means the equality $\End (L/K)=\CD (L/K)\rtimes G(L/K)$ which turns out to be a characteristic property of {\em normal} finite field extensions, \cite{AnGaloisTh-NORMAL-Fields}. The aim of this paper is to obtain an analogue of the Galois Theory for {\em arbitrary} finite field extensions based on results and ideas of \cite{GaloisTh-RingThAp} and \cite{AnGaloisTh-NORMAL-Fields}.</p></details>

We prove that they are ind-admissible and satisfy the homological vanishing criterion in the definition of supercuspidality in the sense of Kohlhaase. In the case of $n=1$ we give a proof of their topological irreducibility for certain cuspidal modules of degree 1.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a new definition of a Frobenius structure on an algebra object in a monoidal category, generalising Frobenius algebras in the category of vector spaces. Our definition allows Frobenius forms valued in objects other than the unit object, and can be seen as a categorical version of Frobenius extensions of the second kind. When the monoidal category is pivotal we define a Nakayama morphism for the Frobenius structure and explain what it means for this morphism to have finite order. Our main example is a well-studied algebra object in the (additive and idempotent completion of the) Temperley-Lieb category at a root of unity. We show that this algebra has a Frobenius structure and that its Nakayama morphism has order 2. As a consequence, we obtain information about Nakayama morphisms of preprojective algebras of Dynkin type, considered as algebras over the semisimple algebras on their vertices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be an odd prime number and let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field in which $p$ is split. Let $f$ be a modular form with good reduction at $p$. We study the variation of the Bloch--Kato Selmer groups and the Bloch--Kato--Shafarevich--Tate groups of $f$ over the anticyclotomic $\mathbf{Z}_p$-extension $K_\infty$ of $K$. In particular, we show that under the generalized Heegner hypothesis, if the $p$-localization of the generalized Heegner cycle attached to $f$ is primitive and certain local conditions hold, then the Pontryagin dual of the Selmer group of $f$ over $K_\infty$ is free over the Iwasawa algebra. Consequently, the Bloch--Kato--Shafarevich--Tate groups of $f$ vanish. This generalizes earlier works of Matar and Matar--Nekovář on elliptic curves. Furthermore, our proof applies uniformly to the ordinary and non-ordinary settings.</p></details>

> **Comment:** generalized formulae and generalized conjecture

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Schanuel Conjecture contains all ``reasonable" statements that can be made on the values of the exponential function. In particular it implies the Lindemann-Weierstrass Theorem. In my Ph.D. I showed that Schanuel Conjecture has a geometrical origin: it is equivalent to the Grothendieck-André periods Conjecture applied to a 1-motive without abelian part. In this paper, we state a conjecture in Schanuel style, which will imply conjectures in Lindemann-Weierstrass style, for the semi-elliptic exponential function, that is for the exponential map of an extension G of an elliptic curve E by a multiplicative group. We propose the semi-elliptic Conjecture, which concerns the exponential function, the Weierstrass $\wp,$ $ζ$ functions and Serre functions. The case of a trivial extension has been treated in \cite{BW}, where we introduced the split semi-elliptic Conjecture. As in Schanuel's case, we expect that the semi-elliptic Conjecture contains all ``reasonable" statements that can be made on the values of the exponential function, of the Weierstrass $\wp$, $ζ$ functions and of Serre functions. We show that the semi-elliptic Conjecture has a geometrical origin (as Schanuel Conjecture): it is equivalent to the Grothendieck-André periods Conjecture applied to a 1-motive whose underlying abelian part is an elliptic curve. We prove the Grothendieck-André periods Conjecture for 1-motives defined by an elliptic curve with algebraic invariants and complex multiplication and by torsion points. We introduce the $σ$-Conjecture which involves the Weierstrass $\wp$, $ζ$ and $σ$ functions and we show that this conjecture is a consequence of the Grothendieck-André periods Conjecture applied to an adequate 1-motive.</p></details>

As an application, we determine the automorphism groups of one-point algebraic geometry codes from such a maximal function field. It turns out that the automorphism groups of one-point algebraic geometry codes agree with that of the Abdón--Torres function field except for the trivial cases. Moreover, we provide a family of maximal function fields with explicit defining equations via considering fixed subfields with respect to some subgroups of automorphism group of the Abdón--Torres function field.</p></details>

We consider two types of algebraic extensions in this paper; one is of extensions obtained by adjoining the coordinates of certain points of various semiabelian varieties; the other is of extensions obtained as the fixed subfield in an algebraically closed field by a finite number of automorphisms. Some of such fields turn out to be new examples of Kummer-faithful fields which are not sub-$p$-adic. Among them, we find both examples of Kummer-faithful fields over which the Mordell--Weil group modulo torsion can be free of infinite rank and not free.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Stone duality establishes a contravariant equivalence between the category of Boolean algebras and the category of compact, Hausdorff, totally disconnected topological spaces (Stone spaces). These spaces are precisely the profinite spaces and form the natural environment for arithmetic objects such as the $p$-adic integers, absolute Galois groups, and profinite completions. In this article we give a rigorous and self-contained development of the construction of the Stone space associated to a Boolean algebra, prove Stone's representation theorem, and describe profinite spaces as inverse limits of finite systems. From there we introduce the Stone--Čech compactification via its universal property and discuss central arithmetic examples (such as $β\mathbb{N}$ and profinite completions), emphasizing their structural role in arithmetic geometry and in the framework of Condensed Mathematics of Clausen--Scholze. The text is aimed at advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students, as well as readers interested in the interface between topology, number theory, and new categorical formulations of topology.</p></details>

Using this relation, we, then proved, x approximates to double the sum of odd harmonic series having first and last terms 1/3 and 1/(2x - 1) respectively. Thereafter, not limiting to consecutive number ratios, we extended its applicability to all the real numbers. Based on these relations, we, then derived a formula for approximating the value of Factorial x. We could also approximate the value of Euler-Mascheroni constant. In these derivations, we used only and only elementary functions, thus this paper is easily comprehensible to students and scholars.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Skein algebras of surfaces quantize character varieties of topological surfaces, and in low genus, these quantizations are often related to algebras arising in representation theory. For example, Terwilliger defined a universal $SL_2$ spherical double affine Hecke algebra $A$; a combination of results in the literature shows $A$ is isomorphic to the $SL_2$ skein algebra of the punctured torus. Stated skein algebras are a generalization which quantize decorated character varieties. In this paper, we used stated skein algebras to construct a new embedding of $A$ into a rank 6 quantum torus, and we show that each marked 3-manifold with a torus boundary produces a module over $A$. We also determine a generating set for the stated skein algebra of $T^2\setminus D^2$, and we find many relations; however, finding a complete list of relations is still an open problem.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 34 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the underlying geometry of the Spence--Kummer functional equation for the trilogarithm. Our geometry determines a certain path system on the projective line minus three points, connecting the standard tangential base point to the nine variables of the $Li_{3}$ terms in the equation, which reflects the geometry of the so-called non-Fano arrangement. Consequently, we derive a precise form of the Spence--Kummer equation together with its $\ell$-adic Galois analogue by using algebraic relations between polylogarithm generating series arising from the path system. We apply the tensor and homotopy criteria for functional equations of iterated integrals due to Zagier and Nakamura--Wojtkowiak. To compute the lower-degree terms of the functional equation in both the complex and the $\ell$-adic Galois cases, we also focus on a diagram of three geometric objects: the moduli space $M_{0,5}$, the complement to the Coxeter arrangement of type ${\rm B_3}$, and the complement to the non-Fano arrangement.</p></details>

This homology admits a natural ring structure and a Schubert basis, giving rise to a well-defined Schubert calculus. We realize $H_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_G)$ in terms of symmetric functions. Our first main result introduces a new family of symmetric functions, called the \emph{dual affine Schur $P$-functions}, which represent the Schubert classes. These functions are defined through the action of the affine nil-Hecke algebra, and specialize, in the stable limit as $n\to \infty$, to the dual factorial $P$-functions of Nakagawa and Naruse. Our second main result gives a precise comparison between this symmetric function model and the geometric construction of $H_*^T (\mathrm{Gr}_G)$ due to Ginzburg and Peterson, which identifies it with a coordinate ring of a centralizer family in the Langlands dual group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix primes $p$ and $\ell$ with $\ell\neq p$. If $(A,λ)$ is a $g$-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety, an $(\ell)^g$-isogeny of $(A,λ)$ has kernel a maximal isotropic subgroup of the $\ell$-torsion of $A$; the image has a natural principal polarization. We define three isogeny graphs associated to such $(\ell)^g$-isogenies -- the big isogeny graph $\mathit{Gr}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$, the little isogeny graph $\mathit{gr}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$, and the enhanced isogeny graph $\widetilde{\mathit{gr}}_{\!g}(\ell, p)$. We prove that all three isogeny graphs are connected. One ingredient of the proof is strong approximation for the quaternionic unitary group, which has previously been applied to moduli of abelian varieties in charateristic $p$ by Chai, Ekedahl/Oort, and Chai/Oort. The adjacency matrices of the three isogeny graphs are given in terms of the Brandt matrices defined by Hashimoto, Ibukiyama, Ihara, and Shimizu. We study some basic properties of these Brandt matrices and recast the theory using the notion of Brandt graphs. We show that the isogeny graphs $\mathit{Gr}_{\!g}(\ell, p)$ and $\mathit{gr}_{\!g}(\ell, p)$ are in fact our Brandt graphs. We give the $\ell$-adic uniformization of $\mathit{gr}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$ and $\widetilde{\mathit{gr}}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$. The $(\ell+1)$-regular isogeny graph $\mathit{Gr}_1(\ell,p)$ for supersingular elliptic curves is well known to be Ramanujan. We calculate the Brandt matrices for a range of $g>1$, $\ell$, and $p$. These calculations give four examples with $g>1$ where the regular graph $\mathit{Gr}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$ has two vertices and is Ramanujan, and all other examples we computed with $g>1$ and two or more vertices were not Ramanujan. In particular, the $(\ell)^g$-isogeny graph is not in general Ramanujan for $g>1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the problem of representing the fraction $5/P$ as a sum of three distinct unit fractions $1/A+1/B+1/C$ with $A<B<C$ and $A,B,C\in\mathbb{N}$. The case of primes $P\equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ is analyzed, where two constructive types of solutions arise: ED1 (exactly one denominator divisible by $P$, namely $C=cP$) and ED2 (exactly two denominators divisible by $P$, namely $B=bP$ and $C=cP$). Parametric constructions and enumeration algorithms are developed, including explicit transitions between ED1 and ED2. A deterministic algorithm is proposed, based on the intersection of a parametric lattice defined by pairs $(α,d')$ with bounded boxes. For each fixed prime $P\equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ the algorithm constructively produces a solution. Using analytic methods such as the Bombieri--Vinogradov theorem and the Chebotarev density theorem, it is shown that the density of admissible parameters is high, which yields polylogarithmic search complexity in the average case. A strict complexity guarantee for all primes remains conditional and depends on the finite covering hypothesis. This study extends previous work for coefficient $4$ (the Erdős--Straus conjecture) to coefficient $5$, transferring the same structure of parametrization and constructive solutions. Analytic applications provide averaging tools used for density estimates in parametric boxes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates the distribution of rational and algebraic points of bounded weighted height in weighted projective spaces over number fields. For a weighted projective space with weights q over a number field k of degree m, we derive an asymptotic formula for the count of such points, featuring a leading term D times X raised to m e Q, plus an error term, where e is the extension degree and Q is the sum of the weights. The constant D combines geometric aspects of the weights with an arithmetic obstruction given by the reciprocal of the gcd of the least common multiple of the weights and Euler's totient of m e. This obstruction stems from the non-surjectivity of the natural morphism from the weighted space to ordinary projective space on rational points, linked to nontrivial torsors under groups of roots of unity. We provide a cohomological interpretation, analogous to the Brauer-Manin obstruction. These findings refine a weighted version of the Batyrev-Manin conjecture and open avenues for applications in moduli theory and arithmetic geometry.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Function field lattices are an interesting example of algebraically constructed lattices. Their minimum distance is bounded below by a function of the gonality of the underlying function field. Known explicit examples--coming mostly from elliptic and Hermitian curves--typically meet this lower bound. In this paper, we construct, for every integer $n \geqslant 4$, a new family of lattices arising from the Fermat function field $F_n$ and the set of its $3n$ total inflection points. These lattices have rank $3n-1$, and we show that their minimum distance equals $\sqrt{2n}$, thereby exceeding the classical bound $\sqrt{2γ(F_n)} = \sqrt{2(n-1)}$. We also determine their kissing number, which turns out to be independent of $n$, and analyze the structure of the second shortest vectors. Our results provide the first explicit examples of function field lattices of arbitrarily large rank whose minimum distance surpasses the expected bound, offering new geometric features of potential interest for coding-theoretic and cryptographic applications.</p></details>

We start with finding suitable types of cusp labels and cone decompositions which are compatible with those of the associated Hodge-type Shimura varieties. We then study the action of $\mathbb{Q}$-points of the adjoint group on boundary charts and toroidal compactifications of Hodge-type integral models. In particular, we extend the twisting construction of Kisin and Pappas to boundary charts. Finally, up to taking refinements of cone decompositions, we construct an abelian-type toroidal compactification as an open and closed algebraic subspace of a quotient from a disjoint union of Hodge-type toroidal compactifications and construct minimal compactifications with a similar method. Furthermore, we show results on nearby cycles of these compactifications and verify Pink's formula when the level at $p$ is an intersection of $n$ quasi-parahoric subgroups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Serre's uniformity question asks whether there exists a bound $N>0$ such that, for every non-CM elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ and every prime $p>N$, the residual Galois representation $ρ_{E,p}:\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}) \to \mathrm{Aut}(E[p])$ is surjective. The work of many authors has shown that, for $p>37$, this representation is either surjective or has image contained in the normaliser of a non-split Cartan subgroup $C_{ns}^+(p)$. Zywina has further proved that, whenever $ρ_{E,p}$ is not surjective for $p>37$, its image is either $C_{ns}^+(p)$ or a certain subgroup $G(p)$ of $C_{ns}^+(p)$ of index $3$. Recently, Le Fourn and Lemos showed that the index-$3$ case cannot arise for $p>1.4 \cdot 10^7$. We strengthen this result by proving that the image of $ρ_{E, p}$ is not conjugate to $G(p)$ for any prime larger than $5$.</p></details>

Note that $A$ is a $3$-dimensional cubic AS-regular algebra. Assume that $\gcd(n, m)=1$ and $m \geq n$. If $n=1$ and $m=1$, then a description of the Hochschild cohomology group of $\nabla A$ was already known by Belmans. If $n=1$ and $m \geq 2$, then the dimensional formula of the Hochschild cohomology group of $\nabla A$ was given by the first author and Ueyama. In this paper, we give the dimensional formula of the Hochschild cohomology group of $\nabla A$ for the case that $n \geq 2$ and $m \geq 2$. As a byproduct of this dimensional formula, we prove that, for $m>n>1$, the derived category of a non-commutative projective scheme associated to $A$ is not equivalent to the derived category of any smooth projective surface. Moreover, we give the ring structure on the Hochschild cohomology group with the Yoneda product for the case that $m\geq n\geq 1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The affine vertex operator algebras for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and the Virasoro minimal models are related by Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction and by the Goddard-Kent-Olive coset construction. In this work, we propose another connection based on certain character identities between these vertex operator algebras and their modules. This relates the simple affine vertex operator algebras $L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at admissible levels $k=-2+q/p$ to the rational $(q,3p)$-minimal models $L_\mathrm{Vir}(c_{q,3p},0)$, and also extends to the nonadmissible levels with $q=1$. Several special cases are particularly interesting. In the nonadmissible case $q=1$, the character identities extend to certain abelian intertwining algebras, specifically $\mathcal{V}^{(p)}$ and the doublet $\mathcal{A}^{(3p)}$. Specialising further to $p=2$, where $\mathcal{V}^{(2)}$ is the simple small $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal algebra of central charge $c=-9$, this recovers, via the 4d/2d-correspondence, a known identity between the Schur indices of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $(3,2)$ Argyres-Douglas theory. In the boundary admissible case $q=2$, in a similar vein, we obtain an identity between the Schur indices of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Argyres-Douglas theories of types $(A_1,D_{2n+1})$ and $(A_1,A_{6n})$. On the other hand, for integral levels, $p=1$, where both involved vertex operator algebras are strongly rational, our character identity induces a Galois conjugation between the representation categories $\mathrm{Rep}(L_{-2+q}(\mathfrak{sl}_2))$ and $\mathrm{Rep}(L_\mathrm{Vir}(c_{q,3},0))$. We conjecture that the characters are related by the action of certain Hecke operators. Finally, we also sketch how to extend the results of this paper to relaxed highest-weight and Whittaker modules.</p></details>

We then construct such a design on the space of sections of the tautological bundle over the complex projective line. By using the irreducible decomposition of this space as an SU(2)-representation, we show that the projection onto its lowest-dimensional summand can be realized as a finite sum of these local maps. Our construction relies on invariant theory for the binary icosahedral group and an analysis of fixed-point subspaces in symmetric tensor representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Montgomery in 1973 introduced the pair correlation method to study the vertical distribution of Riemann zeta-function zeros. This work assumed the Riemann Hypothesis (RH). One striking application was a short proof that at least 2/3 of zeta-zeros are simple zeros, the first result of its type. Over the last 50 years, most work on pair correlation of zeta-zeros has continued to assume RH. Here we show that if RH could be removed from Montgomery's simple zero proof, then this would also give a proof that 2/3 of the zeros are on the critical line. While at present we cannot unconditionally obtain this result, we have proved in joint work that this is true if we assume all the zeros are in a narrow enough region centered on the critical line. In separate joint work we use the same idea with a related pair correlation method to prove that assuming the Pair Correlation Conjecture, also without the assumption of RH, we obtain 100\% of the zeros are simple and on the critical line.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Continued fractions have been generalized over the field of $p$-adic numbers, where it is still not known an analogue of the famous Lagrange's Theorem. In general, the periodicity of $p$-adic continued fractions is well studied and addressed as a hard problem. In this paper, we show a strong connection between periodic $p$--adic continued fractions and the convergence to real quadratic irrationals. In particular, in the first part we prove that the convergence in $\mathbb{R}$ is a necessary condition for the periodicity of the continued fractions of a quadratic irrational in $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Moreover, we leave several conjectures on the converse, supported by experimental computations. In the second part of the paper, we exploit these results to develop a probabilistic argument for the non-periodicity of Browkin's $p$-adic continued fractions. The probabilistic results are conditioned under the assumption of uniform distribution of the $p$-adic digits of a quadratic irrational, that holds for almost all $p$-adic numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The space of two-dimensional geometric adeles of a surface is far from being a locally compact space and there is no translation countably additive invariant nontrivial measure on it. At the same time, certain subquotients of the adeles are direct limits of compact subquotients or inverse limits of discrete subquotients, compatible in a special way. Using this fact, the paper defines a translation invariant measure and integration on certain subquotients of the geometric adeles of surfaces. This theory is considerably different from the theory of integration on analytic adeles of surfaces. After revising aspects of one-dimensional theory, the paper includes a full definition of two-dimensional geometric adeles. A number of their new topological properties are established. The new translation invariant measure and integration on selective subquotients of the geometric adeles is used for integrals of certain functions in a two-dimensional method describing the size of adelic cohomology groups of surfaces, without using standard adelic complexes. A formula for the Euler characteristic of the surface and its divisor in terms of integrals over subquotients of geometric adeles is proved. Using the Euler characteristic, a new two-dimensional adelic intersection number is introduced. For geometric surfaces it is a positive multiple of the standard intersection number. Several results in the previous study of geometric adeles are given new proofs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We extend based cluster algebras from the finite rank case to the infinite rank case. By extending (quantum) cluster algebras whose initial seeds are associated with signed words (arising from double Bott--Samelson cells), we recover infinite rank cluster algebras arising from representations of (shifted) quantum affine algebras. As a main application, we show that the fundamental variables of the cluster algebras arising from double Bott--Samelson cells can be computed via a braid group action when the Cartan matrix is of finite type. We also obtain the equality A=U for the associated infinite rank (quantum) cluster algebras. Additionally, several conjectures regarding quantum virtual Grothendieck rings due to Jang--Lee--Oh and Oh--Park follow as consequences. Finally, we show that the cluster algebras arising from representations of shifted quantum affine algebras, discovered by Geiss--Hernandez--Leclerc, admit natural quantizations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We solve the conjecture of Ginzburg, Guay, Opdam, and Rouquier regarding constructing highest weight covers of the Hecke algebra, in type D. Departing from existing Cherednik-algebra techniques, our new theory is based on an interplay between a natural generalization of dual Specht modules, and a Grothendieck spectral sequence for finite-dimensional algebras that admit (inverse) Schur functors. While the main result is regarding type $D_{2m} = G(2,2,2m)$, partial results are proved along the way for complex reflection groups $G(d,d,dm)$ and $G(m,1,d)$. Our framework should extend to all Weyl groups and general $G(m,r,n)$. A key ingredient in our methods is a unifying construction of modules over quantum wreath products, in terms of parabolic inductions on tensor products of the ``wreath modules'' introduced in the article. This construction simultaneously recovers (and hence provides a more transparent realization of) important families of modules in the literature, including simple modules over the Ariki-Koike algebra, (anti)spherical modules and the Kashiwara-Miwa-Stern modules over the affine Hecke algebra, as well as the Specht and simple modules over the Hu algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Harish-Chandra classified discrete series representations of real semisimple Lie groups by describing their characters as tempered distributions with an explicit formula on the elliptic set. His approach was inspired by Weyl's proof of the character formula for irreducible representations of compact Lie groups. Hecht, Miličić, Schmid and Wolf gave an alternative construction using the localization theory of Beilinson and Bernstein: the discrete series are the global sections of standard Harish-Chandra sheaves on the flag variety attached to the closed orbits of the complexification of a maximal compact subgroup. Their approach was inspired by the Borel-Weil theorem. In this paper, we give an explicit correspondence between these parametrizations. First, for a nilpotent radical $\mathfrak{n}$ of any Borel subalgebra, we establish a geometric formula for the $\mathfrak{n}$-homology of a module over the universal enveloping algebra of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, in terms of its localization on the flag variety of $\mathfrak{g}$. Then we give applications of the formula to the discrete series. First, we give a geometric proof of Schmid's result describing the $\mathfrak{n}$-homology of discrete series representations for the nilpotent radical $\mathfrak{n}$ attached to a Borel subalgebra containing the Lie algebra of a maximal torus. Using Osborne's formula, this gives the formula for the character on the elliptic set, and leads to the matching of Harish-Chandra's parameters for discrete series representations with the geometric parameters. This gives an alternative approach to the study of the discrete series. As an example, we deduce Blattner's conjecture on the multiplicities of K-types of the discrete series from the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem for the maximal compact subgroup.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f$ and $f'$ be genus $2$ cuspidal Siegel paramodular newforms. We prove that if their Hecke eigenvalues $a_p$ and $a_p'$ satisfy a non-trivial polynomial relation $P(a_p, a_p') = 0$ for a set of primes $p$ of positive density, then $f$ is a scalar multiple of a quadratic twist of $f'$. This result extends the strong multiplicity one theorem, which handles the case $P(x,y) = x - y$, to arbitrary polynomial relations. Our proof analyses the image of the product Galois representation attached to the pair $(f, f')$: we show that this image is as large as possible, unless $f$ is a twist of $f'$. Our results also apply to elliptic modular forms. They therefore provide a unified method for distinguishing both elliptic and Siegel modular forms based on their Hecke data, including their Hecke eigenvalues, Satake parameters, Sato--Tate angles, and the coefficients of their $L$-functions. We apply our methods to recover and generalise a range of existing results and to prove new ones in both the elliptic and Siegel settings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Since their introduction, torsion theories have played a key role in the study of abelian and pointed categories. In representation theory, torsion theories and lattices of torsion classes of mod$ A$, for $A$ a finite-dimensional algebra, have been widely studied. The more recent definition of pretorsion theories, that can be given for any category, has expanded the theory, giving many more instances of ``non-pointed torsion theories'' in unexpected settings. In this work, we introduce and study the lattice $\mathcal{L}_t(A)$ of pretorsion classes of mod$ A$. These lattices are in close connection with the lattices tors$ A$ of torsion classes of mod$ A$. We fully describe the completely join-irreducible elements of $\mathcal{L}_t(A)$. Moreover, we characterise and give a full classification of when $\mathcal{L}_t(A)$ is distributive and further describe when it can be identified with the \emph{distributive closure} of tors$ A$. Finally, we show how the lattices of pretorsion classes, together with their duals, can be used to build pretorsion theories in mod$ A$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unfolding singular points in linear differential equations is a classical technique for studying the properties of irregular singularities by relating them to regular singularities. In this paper, we propose a general framework for unfolding unramified irregular singularities of meromorphic connections on the trivial principal $G$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. One of our main results is the description of the unfolding of singularities in terms of deformations of their moduli spaces. We show that every moduli space of irreducible meromorphic $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ can be deformed into a moduli space of irreducible Fuchsian $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. Furthermore, we study the unfolding of additive Deligne-Simpson problems, in which the unfolding of irregular singularities naturally generates a family of such problems. As an application of our main result, we prove that a Deligne-Simpson problem for $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities admits a solution if and only if every unfolded Deligne-Simpson problem in the family admits a simultaneous solution. We also provide a combinatorial and diagrammatic framework of the unfolding process in terms of spectral types and unfolding diagrams. Finally, we address a conjecture proposed by Oshima concerning the existence of irreducible $G$-connections that realize prescribed spectral types and their unfoldings. Our main result gives an affirmative answer to this conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $Γ$ denote a distance-regular graph with vertex set $X$ and diameter $D \geq 3$. Fix a vertex $x \in X$. Let the field $\mathbb{F}$ be either $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. Let $\mathrm{Mat}_X(\mathbb{F})$ denote the $\mathbb{F}$-algebra of matrices whose rows and columns are indexed by $X$ and all entries in $\mathbb{F}$. The Terwilliger algebra $T^\mathbb{F} = T^\mathbb{F}(x)$ is the subalgebra of $\mathrm{Mat}_X(\mathbb{F})$ generated by the adjacency matrix $A$ of $Γ$ and the dual primitive idempotents $\{E_i^*\}_{i=0}^D$ of $Γ$ with respect to $x$. Let $\{E_i\}_{i=0}^D$ denote the primitive idempotents of $A$. Assume that the ordering $\{E_i\}_{i=0}^D$ is $Q$-polynomial. Let $W$ denote an irreducible $T^\mathbb{F}$-module. We say that $W$ is sharp over $\mathbb{F}$ whenever $\dim (E_r^* W) = 1$, where $r$ is the endpoint of $W$. It is known, by Nomura and Terwilliger (2008), that every irreducible $T^\mathbb{C}$-module is sharp. In this paper, we prove that every irreducible $T^\mathbb{R}$-module is sharp. Once this is established, we obtain four additional results: (i) if $W$ is an irreducible $T^\mathbb{R}$-module, then its complexification $W^\mathbb{C}= W \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C}$ is an irreducible $T^\mathbb{C}$-module; (ii) two irreducible $T^\mathbb{R}$-modules $W_1$ and $W_2$ are isomorphic if and only if their complexifications $W_1^\mathbb{C}$ and $W_2^\mathbb{C}$ are isomorphic as $T^\mathbb{C}$-modules; (iii) if $\bigoplus_{i=1}^h \mathrm{Mat}_{n_i}(\mathbb{C})$ is the Wedderburn decomposition of $T^\mathbb{C}$, then $\bigoplus_{i=1}^h \mathrm{Mat}_{n_i}(\mathbb{R})$ is the Wedderburn decomposition of $T^\mathbb{R}$; (iv) each of the subalgebras $E_1^* T E_1^*$, $E_1 T E_1$, $E_D^* T E_D^*$, and $E_D T E_D$ is commutative and every element of these algebras is a symmetric matrix.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 29 pages. This is a revision of the part on stable equivalences in arXiv:2312.08794. New results are added. We stress that every finite-dimensional algebra over a field R is isomorphic to the centralizer of two matrices in a full matrix algebra over the field R. Thus the class of all centralizers of one matrix is an impotent part of finite-dimensonal algebras over fields

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As is known, every finite-dimensional algebra over a field is isomorphic to the centralizer algebra of two matrices. So it is fundamental to study first the centralizer algebra of a single matrix, called a centralizer matrix algebra. In this article, stable equivalences between centralizer matrix algebras over arbitrary fields are completely characterized in terms of a new equivalence relation on matrices. Moreover, stable equivalences of centralizer matrix algebras over perfect fields induce stable equivalences of Morita type, thus preserve dominant, finitistic and global dimensions. Our methods also show that algebras stably equivalent to a centralizer matrix algebra over a field have the same number of non-isomorphic, non-projective simple modules. Thus the Auslander--Reiten conjecture on stable equivalences holds true for centralizer matrix algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $Λ$ be a finite dimensional algebra. Let $\mathcal C$ be a functorially finite exact subcategory of $Λ$-mod with enough projective and injective objects and $\mathcal S (\mathcal C)$ be its monomorphism category. It turns out that the category $\mathcal S (\mathcal C)$ has almost split sequences. We show an explicit formula for the Auslander-Reiten translation in $\mathcal S (\mathcal C)$. Furthermore, if $\mathcal C$ is a stably $d$-Calabi-Yau Frobenius category, we calculate objects under powers of Auslander-Reiten translation in the triangulated category $\overline{\mathcal S(\mathcal C)}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Vafa-Witten observed that Yoshioka's blow-up formula for the Euler characteristics of rank $r$ instantons on an algebraic surface coincides with the character of the Wess-Zumino-Witten model for $\mathrm{SU}(r)$ at level $1$, and raised the question of finding a rational conformal field theory explanation for this striking coincidence. In this work, we provide an answer to this question by constructing and analyzing the affine $\mathrm{gl}_r$ action on various cohomology theories, including the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves, Hochschild homology, Chow groups, and Hodge cohomology, of the moduli space of stable sheaves on a blown-up surface. A key ingredient in our proof is a representation-theoretic reformulation of the theory of Grassmannians of Tor-amplitude $[0,1]$-perfect complexes studied by the first-named author in terms of the spin representation of the finite-dimensional Clifford algebra. This may be viewed as a finite analog of the question of Vafa-Witten via the Boson-Fermion correspondence.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Details added in various sections

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For all infinite rings $R$ that are finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}$, we show that Hilbert's tenth problem has a negative answer. This is accomplished by constructing elliptic curves $E$ without rank growth in certain quadratic extensions $L/K$. To achieve such a result unconditionally, our key innovation is to use elliptic curves $E$ with full rational $2$-torsion which allows us to combine techniques from additive combinatorics with $2$-descent.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Amdeberhan and Merca recently studied arithmetic properties of the sequence $a(n)$, the reciprocal of the crank parity function, which counts the number of integer partitions of weight $n$ whose even parts are monochromatic and whose odd parts may appear in one of three colors (OEIS A298311). A key result of their work was the congruence $a(7n + 2) \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ for all $n \geq 0$. We prove new congruences for the reciprocal crank parity function modulo powers of $7$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Mahler equations arise in a wide range of contexts including the study of finite automata, regular sequences, algebraic series over Fp(z), and periods of Drinfeld modules. Introduced a century ago by K. Mahler to study the transcendence of certain complex numbers, they have recently been the subject of several works establishing a deep connection between such transcendence properties and the nature of their solutions. While numerous studies have investigated these solutions, existing algorithms can only compute them in specific rings: rational functions, power series, Puiseux series, or Hahn series. This paper solves the problem by providing an algorithm that computes a complete basis of solutions for any Mahler equation, along with a decomposition of each solution over the field of Puiseux series. Along the way, we describe an algorithm that computes a fundamental matrix of solutions for any Mahler system.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $H_{2n^2}$ be the Kac-Paljutkin type Hopf algebra of dimension $2n^2$, $A$ its graded Koszul Artin-Schelter regular $H_{2n^2}$-module algebra of dimension $2$, $A^!$ the Koszul dual of $A$, and $A^{\mathrm{op}}_c$ the braided-opposite algebra of $A$. This paper describes $(0, 1)$-degree PBW-deformations of the smash product $A \sharp H_{2n^2}$ and those of $A^! \sharp\, H_{2n^2}$ under the condition that the Koszul dual $A^!$ of $A$ is also an $H_{2n^2}$-module algebra. Also, $0$-degree PBW-deformations of $(A \otimes^c A^{\mathrm{op}}_c) \sharp\, H_{2n^2}$ are explored, where $A \otimes^c A^{\mathrm{op}}_c$ is the associated braided tensor product algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a class of neither pointed nor semisimple Hopf algebras $H_{4n}$ of dimension $4n$, it is shown that they are quasi-triangular, which universal $R$-matrices are described. The corresponding weak Hopf algebras $\mathfrak{w}H_{4n}$ and their representations are constructed. Finally, their duality and their Green rings are established by generators and relations explicitly. It turns out that the Green rings of the associated weak Hopf algebras are not commutative even if the Green rings of $H_{4n}$ are commutative.</p></details>
