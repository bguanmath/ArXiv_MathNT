<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over a number field $k$. The Green--Griffiths--Lang conjecture relates the question of finiteness of rational points in $X$ to the triviality of rational maps from abelian varieties to $X$ and to complex hyperbolicity. Here we investigate the phenomenon of sparsity of rational points in $X$ -- roughly speaking, when there are very few rational points if counted ordered by height. We are interested in the case when sparsity holds over every finite extension of $k$, in which case we say that the variety is \emph{xeric}. We initiate a systematic study of the relation of this property with the non-existence of rational curves in $X$ as well as with certain notion of $p$-adic hyperbolicity.</p></details>
