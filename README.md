### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03208v1'>2510.03208</a>\]&nbsp; **Tilting Objects via Recollements and $p$-Cycles on Weighted Projective Lines**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-03 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Qiang Dong, Hongxia Zhang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we provide a new method for constructing tilting objects in a triangulated category via recollements. The $p$-cycle approach to exceptional curve processes significant advantages in constructing recollements and ladders, due to the existence of reduction/insertion functors. In order to construct tilting objects in the stable category of vector bundles over a weighted projective line, we give explicit expressions for line bundles and extension bundles due to the $p$-cycles constuctions. Furthermore, we provide an essential proof for tilting cuboic object and tilting objects consisting of Auslander bundles. Moreover, we construct certain new tilting objects in the stable category of vector bundles over a weighted projective line.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-03 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Robert Boltje, Gabriel Navarro &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 11 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is motivated by a strong version of Feit's conjecture, first formulated by the authors in joint work with A. Kleshchev and P. H. Tiep in 2025, concerning the conductor $c(\chi)$ of an irreducible character $\chi$ of a finite group $G$. We connect the conjecture with the following construction: For any positive integer $n$ dividing the exponent of $G$ and for any character $\chi$ of $G$, we introduce an integer-valued invariant $S(G,\chi,n)$ which can be defined as the sum of certain coefficients of the canonical Brauer induction formula of $\chi$, or alternatively as the multiplicity of the trivial character in a specified integral linear combination of Adams operations of $\chi$. We show two facts about this invariant. The first seems of independent interest (apart from Feit's conjecture): $S(G,\chi,n)$ is always non-negative, and it is positive if and only if a representation affording $\chi$ involves an eigenvalue of order $n$. Secondly, the strong version of Feit's conjecture holds for an irreducible character $\chi$ if and only if $S(G,\chi, c(\chi))>0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There has been a recent surge of interest on distributions of shapes of unit lattices in number fields, due to both their applications to number theory and the lack of known results. In this work we focus on $D_4$-quartic fields with signature $(2,1)$; such fields have a rank $2$ unit group. Viewing the unit lattice as a point of $GL_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash \mathfrak{h}$, we prove that every lattice which arises this way must correspond to a transcendental point on the boundary of a certain fundamental domain of $GL_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash \mathfrak{h}$. Moreover, we produce three explicit (algebraic) points of $GL_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash \mathfrak{h}$ which are limit points of the set of (points associated to) unit lattices of $D_4$-quartic fields with signature $(2,1)$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-03 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yuri Berest, Yun Liu, Ajay C. Ramadoss &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 124 pages; 6 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study a new class of topological $G$-spaces generalizing the classical flag manifolds $G/T$ of compact connected Lie groups. These spaces, which we call the $m$-quasi-flag manifolds $ F_m = F_m(G,T) $, are topological realizations of the algebras $ Q_k(W) $ of $k$-quasi-invariant polynomials of the Weyl group $ W $ in the sense that their (even-dimensional) $G$-equivariant cohomology $ H_G(F_m, {\mathbb C}) $ is naturally isomorphic to $ Q_k(W) $, where $ m $ is a $W$-invariant integer-valued multiplicity function on the system of roots of $W$ and $ k = \frac{m}{2}$ or $ \frac{m+1}{2}$ depending on whether $m$ is even or odd. Many topological properties and algebraic structures related to the flag manifolds can be extended to quasi-flag manifolds. We compute the cohomology of quasi-flag manifolds by constructing their rational algebraic models in terms of coaffine stacks -- a certain kind of derived stacks introduced by B.To\"en and J. Lurie to provide an algebro-geometric framework for rational homotopy theory. Besides cohomology, we also compute the equivariant K-theory of quasi-flag manifolds and extend some of our cohomological results to the multiplicative setting. On the topological side, our approach is strongly influenced by the classical work on homotopy decompositions of classifying spaces of compact Lie groups; however, the diagrams that we use in our decompositions do not arise from collections of subgroups of $G$ but rather from moment graphs -- combinatorial objects introduced in a different area of topology called the GKM theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The canonical van der Waerden theorem asserts that, for sufficiently large $n$, every colouring of $[n]$ contains either a monochromatic or a rainbow arithmetic progression of length $k$ ($k$-AP, for short). In this paper, we determine the threshold at which the binomial random subset $[n]_p$ almost surely inherits this canonical Ramsey type property. As an application, we show the existence of sets $A\subseteq [n]$ such that the $k$-APs in $A$ define a $k$-uniform hypergraph of arbitrarily high girth and yet any colouring of $A$ induces a monochromatic or rainbow $k$-AP.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-03 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yao Cheng &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 30 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The conjectural theory of local newofmrs for the split $p$-adic group ${\rm SO}_{2n+1}$, proposed by Gross, predicts that the space of local newforms in a generic representation is one-dimensional. In this note, we prove that this space is at most one-dimensional and verify its expected arithmetic properties, conditional on existence. These results play an important role in our proof of the existence part of the newform conjecture.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2; comments welcome! Minor changes from the last version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The unit group of the ring of integers of a number field, modulo torsion, is a lattice via the logarithmic Minkowski embedding. We examine the shape of this lattice, which we call the unit shape, within the family of prime degree $p$ number fields whose Galois closure has dihedral Galois group $D_p$ and a unique real embedding. In the case $p = 5$, we prove that the unit shapes lie on a single hypercycle on the modular surface (in this case, the modular surface is the space of shapes of rank $2$ lattices). For general $p$, we show that the unit shapes are contained in a finite union of translates of periodic torus orbits in the space of shapes.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 81 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe a framework for encoding cluster combinatorics using categorical methods. We give a definition of an abstract cluster structure, which captures the essence of cluster mutation at a tropical level and show that cluster algebras, cluster varieties, cluster categories and surface models all have associated abstract cluster structures. For the first two classes, we also show that they can be constructed from abstract cluster structures. By defining a suitable notion of morphism of abstract cluster structures, we introduce a category of these and show that it has several desirable properties, such as initial and terminal objects and finite products and coproducts. We also prove that rooted cluster morphisms of cluster algebras give rise to morphisms of the associated abstract cluster structures, so that our framework includes a version of the extant category of cluster algebras. We can do more, however, because we can relate different types of representation of abstract cluster structures (cluster algebra, varieties, categories) directly via morphisms of their associated abstract cluster structures, even though no direct map from e.g. a cluster category to the associated cluster algebra is possible. In fact, we do much of the above in the setting of abstract quantum cluster structures, with some analysis of the difference between the category of these and that of the unquantized version. In order to show the relationship between abstract quantum cluster structures and quantum cluster algebras, we reformulate the usual construction of the latter in a way that is more amenable to our purposes and which we expect will be of independent interest and use.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-03 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Rutwig Campoamor-Stursberg, Alessio Marrani, Michel Rausch de Traubenberg &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** hep-th &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 69 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this review, we present a general framework for the construction of Kac-Moody (KM) algebras associated to higher-dimensional manifolds. Starting from the classical case of loop algebras on the circle $\mathbb{S}^{1}$, we extend the approach to compact and non-compact group manifolds, coset spaces, and soft deformations thereof. After recalling the necessary geometric background on Riemannian manifolds, Hilbert bases and Killing vectors, we present the construction of generalized current algebras $\mathfrak{g}(\mathcal{M})$, their semidirect extensions with isometry algebras, and their central extensions. We show how the resulting algebras are controlled by the structure of the underlying manifold, and illustrate the framework through explicit realizations on $SU(2)$, $SU(2)/U(1)$, and higher-dimensional spheres, highlighting their relation to Virasoro-like algebras. We also discuss the compatibility conditions for cocycles, the role of harmonic analysis, and some applications in higher-dimensional field theory and supergravity compactifications. This provides a unifying perspective on KM algebras beyond one-dimensional settings, paving the way for further exploration of their mathematical and physical implications.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-03 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yu Min &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use the Tannakian formalism to define the Emerton--Gee stack for general groups. For a flat algebraic group G over Z_p, we are able to prove the associated Emerton--Gee stack is a formal algebraic stack locally of finite presentation over Spf(Z_p). We also define a derived stack of Laurent F-crystals with G-structure on the absolute prismatic site, whose underlying classical stack is proved to be equivalent to the Emerton--Gee stack. In the case of connected reductive groups, we show that the derived stack of Laurent F-crystals with G-structure is classical in the sense that when restricted to truncated animated rings, it is the \'etale sheafification of the left Kan extension of the Emerton--Gee stack along the inclusion from classical commutative rings to animated rings. Moreover, when G is a generalised reductive group, the classicality result still holds for a modified version of the Emerton--Gee stack. In particular, this completes the picture that the derived stack of local Langlands parameters for the Langlands dual group of a reductive group is classical.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish new restrictions on the values of the lifting obstruction for projective unitary representations of second countable, locally compact Hausdorff groups on operator algebras. Using these, we show that every projective representation on the Jiang--Su algebra lifts to a genuine group representation. We also characterise the possible values of lifting obstructions for finite group projective representations on UHF-algebras of infinite type and Cuntz algebras. Finally we show that certain 2-cocycles of Property (T) groups cannot arise as lifting invariants of projective representations on the Hyperfinite II$_{1}$ factor.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-03 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Konstanze Rietsch &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By a theorem of Edrei, an infinite, normalised totally nonnegative upper-triangular Toeplitz matrices is determined by a pair of nonnegative parameter sequences, the `Schoenberg parameters', where nonzero parameters correspond to the roots and poles of a naturally associated generating function. These totally nonnegative Toeplitz matrices and their parameters also arise in the classification of characters of the infinite symmetric group by later work of Thoma. Moreover the Schoenberg parameters have an asymptotic interpretation in terms of irreducible representations of S_n and their Young diagrams by Vershik-Kerov. In this article we consider infinite totally positive Toeplitz matrices as limits of finite ones, and we obtain two further asymptotic descriptions of the Schoenberg parameters that are now related to quantum cohomology of the flag variety as n goes to infinity. One is related to asymptotics of normalised quantum parameters, and the other to asymptotics of the Chern classes of the tautological line bundles. We also describe the asymptotics of (quantum) Schubert classes in terms of the Schoenberg parameters. Our limit formulas relate to and were motivated by a tropical analogue of this theory that we survey. In the tropical setting one finds an asymptotic relationship between the `tropical Schoenberg parameters' and the weight map from Lusztig's parametrisation of the canonical basis.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages, 1 figure, 1 table; v2: minor changes

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any cluster-tilting object $\mathsf{T}$ in the cluster category $\mathscr{C}_{n}$ of type $\mathbb{A}_{n}$, we construct a rank-four oriented matroid $\mathcal{M}_{\mathsf{T}}$ such that stackable triangulations of $\mathcal{M}_{\mathsf{T}}$ are in bijection with equivalence classes of maximal green sequences with initial cluster $\mathsf{T}$. This generalises the result that equivalence classes of maximal green sequences of linearly oriented $\mathbb{A}_{n}$ are in bijection with triangulations of a three-dimensional cyclic polytope. The definition of the oriented matroid $\mathcal{M}_{\mathsf{T}}$ arises from the extriangulated structure on $\mathscr{C}_{n}$ which makes $\mathsf{T}$ projective.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: cleverref issue solved

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is the second part of a series that intends to study the resolving subcategories for gentle algebras over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{K}$. As in the first part, we continue to focus on gentle quivers $(Q,R)$, where $Q$ is a directed tree, known as gentle trees. In our previous work, via a modified surface model for gentle algebras with finite global dimension, we studied the join-irreducible elements of the lattice of resolving subcategories of $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R \rangle - \text{mod}$, which happen to be those generated by a non-projective indecomposable object. In this paper, we notice that this lattice is not semidistributive in general and, accordingly, introduce a so-called upper join-decomposition, replacing the canonical one. Together with the techniques we develop in our geometric model, it allows us to describe the resolving subcategories of any gentle tree. These same techniques let us explicitly construct the resolving subcategory generated by any collection of indecomposable $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R\rangle$-modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is the first part of a series that intends to study the resolving subcategories for gentle algebras over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{K}$. In a general setting, we improve the precision of an algorithm from Takahashi for resolving closure calculations in well-behaved abelian categories. Then, we modify the geometric model of Baur--Coelho-Sim\~oes and Opper--Plamondon--Schroll to compute such subcategories for gentle quivers that have a finite global dimension. Finally, we focus on gentle quivers $(Q,R)$ such that $Q$ is a directed tree, and we study the monogeneous resolving subcategories, which are the ones generated by a single non-projective indecomposable $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R \rangle$-module. By the way, we prove that these subcategories are the join-irreducible elements of the poset of all the resolving subcategories ordered by inclusion.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 13 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1887, Minkowski determined the least common multiple of the orders of all finite subgroups of $GL_n(\mathbb{Q})$; we refer to this number as $M(n)$. In (Katznelson, 1994), Katznelson provides the asymptotic behaviour of $M(n)$, with a small error term. In this paper, we use elementary techniques to find explicit upper and lower bounds on $M(n)$ that improve on Katznelson's results; we also recover his asymptotic result. Our results immediately imply explicit bounds on functions closely related to $M(n)$, which appear in the study of abelian varieties (see, for example, (Silverberg, 1992), (Guralnick and Kedlaya, 2017) and (Ozeki, 2024)). Finally, we examine the function $\Phi(n)$, which also appears in (Ozeki, 2024), defined as the greatest positive integer $m$ for which $\varphi(m)$ divides $2n$. We provide explicit upper bounds on $\Phi(n)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the shrinking target and recurrence set associated to non-autonomous measure-preserving systems on compact metric spaces, establishing zero-one criteria in the spirit of classical Borel-Cantelli results. Our first main theorem gives a quantitative shrinking target result for non-autonomous systems under a uniform mixing condition, providing asymptotics with an optimal error term. This general result is applicable to certain families of inner functions, yielding concrete applications such as digit patterns in multi-base expansions. Turning to recurrence, we establish new zero-measure laws for non-autonomous systems. In the autonomous case, we prove a zero-one criterion for recurrence sets of centred, one-component inner functions via Markov partitions and distortion estimates. Together, these results provide a unified framework for shrinking target and recurrence problems in both autonomous and non-autonomous dynamics.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Questions related to Brauer-Manin obstructions to the Hasse principle and weak approximation for homogeneous spaces of tori over a number field are well-studied, generally using arithmetic duality theorems, starting with works of Sansuc and of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene. In this article, we prove the analogous statements (and include obstructions to strong approximation over finite places) in the general case of a commutative affine group scheme $G$ of finite type over a global field in any characteristic. We also study finiteness of different variants of the second Tate-Shafarevich kernel (such as $S$-kernels and $\omega$-kernels) of the Cartier dual of $G$. All this is made possible by some recent theoretical advancements in positive characteristic, namely the finiteness theorems of B. Conrad and the generalized Tate duality of Z. Rosengarten.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define a notion of slant sum of quiver gauge theories, a type of surgery on the underlying quiver. Under some mild assumptions, we relate torus fixed points on the corresponding Higgs branches, which are Nakajima quiver varieties. Then we prove a formula relating the quasimap vertex functions before and after a slant sum, which is a type of ``branching rule" for vertex functions. Our construction is motivated by a conjecture, which we make here, for the factorization of the vertex functions of zero-dimensional quiver varieties. The branching rule allows this conjecture to be approached inductively. In special cases, it also provides a formula for the $\hbar=q$ specialization of vertex functions for quiver varieties not necessarily of Dynkin type as a sum over reverse plane partitions. When passed through the quantum Hikita conjecture, such expressions provide conjectural formulas for graded traces of Verma modules on the 3d mirror dual side. We also consider the Coulomb side. We make some conjectures reflecting what can be seen on the Higgs side and prove them in ADE type. We study slant sums of Coulomb branches and their quantizations. We prove that for one-dimensional framing, slant sum operation on the Coulomb branch side corresponds to taking products.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Minor edits: typos corrected + clarification that reduction at 2 throughout this paper means reduction mod mathfrak{p} dividing 2

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The parity of the partition function $p(n)$ remains strikingly mysterious. Beyond a handful of fragmentary results, essentially nothing is known about the distribution of parity. We prove a uniform result on quadratic progressions. If $1<D\equiv 23\pmod{24}$ is square-free and only divisible by primes $\ell\equiv 1, 7\pmod 8$, then both parities occur infinitely often among $$ p\left(\frac{Dm^2+1}{24}\right), $$ with $(m,6)=1.$ The argument takes place on the modular curve $X_0(6)$ and shows that parity along these thin orbits is \emph{not constant}. The proof connects classical identities for the partition generating function, through the method of (twisted) Borcherds products, to the arithmetic geometry of {\it ordinary} CM fibers on the Deligne-Rapoport model of $X_0(6)$ in characteristic 2. This result is a special case of a general theorem for the coefficients of suitable vector-valued weight 1/2 harmonic Maass forms that satisfy a "Heegner packet'' condition.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a number field $K \neq \mathbb{Q}$, in a now classic work, Stark pinpointed the possible source of a so-called Landau-Siegel zero of the Dedekind zeta function $\zeta_K(s)$ and used this to give effective upper and lower bounds on the residue of $\zeta_K(s)$ at $s=1$. We extend Stark's work to give effective upper and lower bounds for the leading term of the Laurent expansion of general Artin $L$-functions at $s=1$ that are, up to the value of implied constants, as strong as could reasonably be expected given current progress toward the generalized Riemann hypothesis. Our bounds are completely unconditional, and rely on no unproven hypotheses about Artin $L$-functions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 24 pages, 5 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper studies a basic Markov chain, the Burnside process, on the space of flags $G/B$ with $G = GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $B$ its upper triangular matrices. This gives rise to a shuffling: a Markov chain on the symmetric group realized via the Bruhat decomposition. Actually running and describing this Markov chain requires understanding Springer fibers and the Steinberg variety. The main results give a practical algorithm for all n and q and determine the limiting behavior of the chain when q is large. In describing this behavior, we find interesting connections to the combinatorics of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence and to the geometry of orbital varieties. The construction and description is then carried over to finite Chevalley groups of arbitrary type, describing a new class of Markov chains on Weyl groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we provide details on the proofs of the quantum polynomial time algorithm of Biasse and Song (SODA 16) for computing the $S$-unit group of a number field. This algorithm directly implies polynomial time methods to calculate class groups, S-class groups, relative class group and the unit group, ray class groups, solve the principal ideal problem, solve certain norm equations, and decompose ideal classes in the ideal class group. Additionally, combined with a result of Cramer, Ducas, Peikert and Regev (Eurocrypt 2016), the resolution of the principal ideal problem allows one to find short generators of a principal ideal. Likewise, methods due to Cramer, Ducas and Wesolowski (Eurocrypt 2017) use the resolution of the principal ideal problem and the decomposition of ideal classes to find so-called ``mildly short vectors'' in ideal lattices of cyclotomic fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>These are expanded notes from graduate courses about Lie algebras and Chevalley groups held at the University of Stuttgart. In the 1950s Chevalley showed how linear groups over arbitrary fields could be obtained~ -- ~by a uniform procedure~ -- ~from the simple Lie algebras over $\C$ occurring in the Cartan--Killing classification. Together with subsequent variations, Chevalley's work had a profound and long-lasting impact on group theory and Lie theory in general. Classical, and widely used references are the lectures notes by Steinberg (1967) and the monograph by Carter (1972). Our aim here is to present a self-contained introduction to the theory of Chevalley groups, based on recent simplifications arising from Lusztig's fundamental theory of ``canonical bases''. A further feature of our text is that we explicitly incorporate algorithmic methods in our treatment, both for the handling of substantial examples and regarding some aspects of the general theory. Eventually, this may turn into a book project.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Fixed broken cross references

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that $\kgl$-linear cohomology theories over an affine Dedekind scheme $S$ admit a canonical weight filtration on resolvable motives without inverting residual characteristics. Combined with upcoming work of Annala--Hoyois--Iwasa, this endows essentially all known logarithmic cohomology theories with weight filtrations when evaluated on projective sncd pairs $(X,D)$ over $S$. Furthermore, the weight-filtered cohomology is an invariant of the open part $U = X-D$. On variants of de Rham cohomology, we show that our weight filtration recovers the d\'ecalaged pole-order filtration defined by Deligne. One interpretation of this is that the spectral sequence associated to the pole-order filtration is an invariant of $U$ from the $E_2$-page onwards, which generalizes a result of Deligne from characteristic 0 to positive and mixed characteristic, and suggests that ``mixed Hodge theory'' is a useful invariant of $S$-schemes. Finally, we compute explicit examples of weight filtered pieces of cohomology theories. One of the computations reproves a slight weakening of a result of Thuillier stating that the singular cohomology of the dual complex associated to the boundary divisor of a good projective compactification does not depend on the chosen compactification. In the appendix, we prove the folklore results that the Whitehead tower functor is fully faithful and that perfect bivariant pairings with respect to the twisted arrow category correspond to duality.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 34 pages, 3 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The colored Jones polynomial $J_{K,N}$ is an important quantum knot invariant in low-dimensional topology. In his seminal paper on quantum modular forms, Zagier predicted the behavior of $J_{K,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$ under the action of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ on $x \in \mathbb{Q}$. More precisely, Zagier made a prediction on the asymptotic value of the quotient $J_{K,0}(e^{2 \pi i \gamma(x)})/ J_{K,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$ for fixed $\gamma \in SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$, as $x \to \infty$ along rationals with bounded denominator. In the case of the figure-eight knot $4_1$, which is the most accessible case, there is an explicit formula for $J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$ as a sum of certain trigonometric products called Sudler products. By periodicity, the behavior of $J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$ under the mapping $x \mapsto x+1$ is trivial. For the second generator of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$, Zagier conjectured that with respect to the mapping $x \mapsto 1/x$, the quotient $h(x) = \log ( J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i x}) / J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i /x}))$ can be extended to a function on $\mathbb{R}$ that is continuous at all irrationals. This conjecture was recently established by Aistleitner and Borda in the case of all irrationals that have an unbounded sequence of partial quotients in their continued fraction expansion. In the present paper we prove Zagier's continuity conjecture in full generality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Kleshchev and Livesey proved the existence of RoCK $p$-blocks for double covers of symmetric and alternating groups over large enough coefficient rings. They proved that RoCK blocks of double covers are Morita equivalent to standard ``local" blocks via bimodules with endopermutation source. Based on this, Kleshchev and Livesey proved that these RoCK blocks are splendidly Rickard equivalent to their Brauer correspondents. The analogous result for blocks of symmetric groups, a theorem of Chuang and Kessar, was an important step in Chuang and Rouquier ultimately proving Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for symmetric groups. In this paper we show that in most cases the Morita equivalences and splendid Rickard equivalences constructed by Kleshchev and Livesey descend to the ring $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p$-adic integers, hence prove Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for most of these RoCK blocks.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The connection between simple Lie algebras and their Yangian algebras has a long history. In this work, we construct finite-dimensional representations of Yangian algebras $\mathsf{Y}(\mathfrak{sl}_{n})$ using the quiver approach. Starting from quivers associated to Dynkin diagrams of type A, we construct a family of quiver Yangians. We show that the quiver description of these algebras enables an effective construction of representations with a single non-zero Dynkin label. For these representations, we provide an explicit construction using the equivariant integration over the corresponding quiver moduli spaces. The resulting states admit a crystal description and can be identified with the Gelfand-Tsetlin bases for $\mathfrak{sl}_{n}$ algebras. Finally, we show that the resulting Yangians possess notable algebraic properties, and the algebras are isomorphic to their alternative description known as the second Drinfeld realization.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Topographs, introduced by Conway in 1997, are infinite trivalent planar trees used to visualize the values of binary quadratic forms. In this work, we study series whose terms are indexed by the vertices of a topograph and show that they can be evaluated using telescoping sums over its edges. Our technique provides arithmetic proofs for modular graph function identities arising in string theory, yields alternative derivations of Hurwitz-style class number formulas, and provides a unified framework for well-known Mordell-Tornheim series and Hata's series for the Euler constant $\gamma$. Our theorems are of the following spirit: we cut a topograph along an edge (called the root) into two parts, and then sum $\frac{1}{rst}$ (the reciprocal of the product of labels on regions adjacent to a vertex) over all vertices of one part. We prove that such a sum is equal to an explicit expression depending only on the root and the discriminant of the topograph.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We make an application of ideas from partition theory to a problem in multiplicative number theory. We propose a deterministic model of prime number distribution, from first principles related to properties of integer partitions, that naturally predicts the prime number theorem as well as the twin prime conjecture. The model posits that, for $n\geq 2$, $$p_{n}\ =\ 1\ +\ 2\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\left\lceil \frac{d(j)}{2}\right\rceil\ +\ \varepsilon(n),$$ where $p_k$ is the $k$th prime number, $d(k)$ is the divisor function, and $\varepsilon(k)$ is an explicit error term that is negligible asymptotically; both the main term and error term represent enumerative functions in our conceptual model. We refine the error term to give numerical estimates of $\pi(n)$ similar to those provided by the logarithmic integral, and much more accurate than $\mathrm{li}(n)$ up to $n=10{,}000$ where the estimates are {\it almost exact}. We then perform computational tests of unusual predictions of the model, finding limited evidence of predictable variations in prime gaps.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: cleveref issues solved

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>On one hand, exact structures were introduced by D. Quillen in the '70s. They can be defined as collections of short exact sequences in a fixed abelian category satisfying additional properties. On the other hand, in a recent work, A. Garver, R. Patrias, and H. Thomas introduced Jordan recoverability. Given a bounded quiver $(Q,R)$, a full additive subcategory of $\mathrm{rep}(Q,R)$ is said to be Jordan recoverable if any $X \in \mathscr{C}$ can be recovered, up to isomorphism, from the Jordan form of its generic nilpotent endomorphisms. Such a subcategory $\mathscr{C}$ is said to be canonically Jordan recoverable if, moreover, there exists a precise algebraic procedure that allows one to get back $X \in \mathscr{C}$ from that same Jordan form data. We introduce a new family of operators, called Gen-Sub operators $\mathrm{GS}_\mathcal{E}$, parametrized by the exact structures $\mathcal{E}$ of abelian categories. After showing some properties of those operators in hereditary abelian categories, by focusing on the setting of modules over type $A$ quivers endowed with the diamond exact structure $\mathcal{E}_\diamond$, we establish that the maximal canonically Jordan recoverable subcategories are precisely of the form $\mathrm{GS}_{\mathcal{E}_\diamond}(T)$ for some tilting object $T$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a stably birational classification for algebraic tori of dimensions $3$ and $4$ over a field $k$. First, we define the weak stably equivalence of algebraic tori and show that there exist $13$ (resp. $128$) weak stably equivalent classes of algebraic tori $T$ of dimension $3$ (resp. $4$) which are not stably rational by computing some cohomological stably birational invariants, e.g. the Brauer-Grothendieck group of $X$ where $X$ is a smooth compactification of $T$, provided by Kunyavskii, Skorobogatov and Tsfasman. We make a procedure to compute such stably birational invariants effectively and the computations are done by using the computer algebra system GAP. Second, we define the $p$-part of the flabby class $[\hat{T}]^{fl}$ as a $\mathbb{Z}_p[{\rm Syl}_p(G)]$-lattice and prove that they are faithful and indecomposable $\mathbb{Z}_p[{\rm Syl}_p(G)]$-lattices unless it vanishes for $p=2$ (resp. $p=2,3$) in dimension $3$ (resp. $4$) via $p$-adic analysis. The $\mathbb{Z}_p$-ranks of them are also given. Third, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for which two not stably rational algebraic tori $T$ and $T^\prime$ of dimensions $3$ (resp. $4$) are stably birationally equivalent in terms of the splitting fields and the weak stably equivalent classes of $T$ and $T^\prime$. In particular, the splitting fields of them should coincide if $\hat{T}$ and $\hat{T}^\prime$ are indecomposable. Forth, for each $7$ cases of not stably but retract rational algebraic tori of dimension $4$, we find an algebraic torus $T^\prime$ of dimension $4$ which satisfies that $T\times_k T^\prime$ is stably rational. Finally, we give a criteria to determine whether two algebraic tori $T$ and $T^\prime$ of general dimensions are stably birationally equivalent when $T$ (resp. $T^\prime$) is stably birationally equivalent to some algebraic torus $T^{\prime\prime}$ of dimension up to $4$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The theory of representations of a crossed module is a direct generalization of the theory of representations of groups. For a finite group G, the Drinfeld quantum double of the group G is a Hopf algebra that represents a special case of crossed module of finite groups. Here we study how to extend the construction of the Drinfeld quantum double for any other kind of crossed module of finite groups. This leads to a Hopf algebra D(G, H) that presents similarities with a Drinfeld double. We then study simple subalgebras of D(G, H) and give two isomorphisms for the decomposition into a product of simple subalgebras. We then study the category D(G, H)-modFd of finite dimensional modules over D(G, H), which turns out to be isomorphic to the category of finite dimensional representations of finite crossed modules of groups. These categories being monoidal, we also study links between direct sums of simple objects and tensor products of simple objects and give some results for a Clebsch-Gordan formula. We, in this context, present and develop the character theory for representations of crossed modules of finite groups, and detail the proofs. We then study the category itself, which leads to some ribbon invariants.</p></details>

Let $\pi_{\ell,a,b}$ be the number of primes $p\leq g_{\ell,a,b}$ having at least $\ell+1$ solutions for (1) and $\pi(x)$ the number of primes not exceeding $x$. In this article, we prove that for a fixed integer $a\ge 3$ with $\gcd(a,b)=1$, $$ \pi_{\ell,a,b}=\left(\frac{a-2}{2(\ell a+a-1)}+o(1)\right)\pi\bigl(g_{\ell,a,b}\bigr)\quad(\text{as}~ b\to\infty). $$ For any non-negative $\ell$ and relatively prime integers $a,b$, satisfying $e^{\ell+1}\leq a<b$, we show that \begin{equation*} \pi_{\ell,a,b}>0.005\cdot \frac{1}{\ell+1}\frac{g_{\ell,a,b}}{\log g_{\ell,a,b}}. \end{equation*} Let $\pi_{\ell,a,b}^{*}$ be the number of primes $p\leq g_{\ell,a,b}$ having at most $\ell$ solutions for (1).

Our main focus is on establishing improved dispersive and Strichartz estimates for this model, which govern the space-time behavior of solutions. We prove refined Strichartz bounds using Van der Corput-type derivative tests, beating previous known results where Strichartz estimates incur 1/4 losses. Moreover, assuming sharp bounds for certain exponential sums, our results indicate the possibility to reduce these losses further to $1/6 + \epsilon$ for all $\epsilon>0$, which would be sharp. We further expect that analogous Strichartz bounds should hold within the Friedlander model domain in higher dimensions.</p></details>

They proved two sets of Ramanujan--like congruences satisfied by $a_5(n)$, relying heavily on modular forms.

I also added some moment bounds and exponential concentraction inequalities, as well as some applications to a some natural combinatorial problem. In view of that the title of the paper has changed

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X_p, p\in\cP$ be a sequence of independent random variables s.t. $\bbP(X_p=\pm 1)=1/2$. Let $\te_j=\prod_{p|j}X_p$ if $j$ is square free and $\te_j=0$ otherwise. Denote $S_n=\sum_{\ell=1}^n\te_\ell$. The from this point of view proving limit theorems for $S_n$ is natural problem, since $S_n$ mimics the behavior of $e^{\sqrt{\ln(\beta)}}$. It is a natural guiding conjecture that $S_n/\sqrt n$ obeys the central limit theorem (CLT). However, S. Chatterjee conjectured (as expressed in \cite{[25]}) that the CLT should not hold. Chatterjee's conjecture was proved by Harper \cite{[17]}, and by now it is a direct consequence of a more recent breakthrough by Harper \cite{Har20} that $\frac{S_n}{b_n}\to 0$ in $L^1$, where $b_n=(n^{1/2}(\ln(\ln(n)))^{-1/4})u_n, u_n\to\infty$. In particular $S_n/\sqrt n\to 0$. Nevertheless, the question whether there exists a sequence $a_n=o(b_n)$ such that $S_n/a_n$ converges to some limit remains a mystery. Note that the corresponding problem in the Steinhaus Setting was recently resolved by \cite{Gor1}. In this paper make an attempt to shed some light on the convergence of $S_n/a_n$. Additionally, we obtain explicit estimates on hight moments of $S_n$ without restrictions on the size of the moment compared to $n$ like in \cite[Theorem 1.2]{Har19}, which is of independent interest. This is achieved by a martingale argument together with the Burkholder inequality, and it has applications in a natural number theoretic combinatorial problem. Using martingale techniques we will also obtain exponential concentration inequalities for $S_n$ (in the large deviations regime)</p></details>

The bulk of the proof concerns p-primary torsion in characteristic p. Our approach gives a more direct proof of the boundedness of the p-primary torsion of the Brauer group of an abelian variety, as recently proved by D'Addezio. We show that the transcendental Brauer group of a Kummer surface over k has finite exponent, but can be infinite when k is an infinite field of positive characteristic. This answers a question of Zarhin and the author.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The set of infinite upper-triangular totally positive Toeplitz matrices has a classical parametrisation proved by Edrei et al and originally conjectured by Schoenberg, that involves pairs of sequences of positive real parameters. These matrices (and their parameters) are central for understanding characters of the infinite symmetric group by work of Thoma. On the other hand there is a very different parametrisation theorem that applies to the finite analogue of this set. These finite Toeplitz matrices and their parameters relate to quantum cohomology of flag varieties and mirror symmetry. In this paper we replace the positive reals by a semifield with valuation to then construct tropical analogues for both parametrisation theorems. In the finite case we tropicalise using positive generalised Puiseaux series. This builds on work of Judd and L\"udenbach. In the infinite case we use a new valued semifield of continuous functions. We arrive at different natural infinite analogues of totally positive Toeplitz matrices, depending on a choice of topology on our valued semifield. We then prove an asymptotic result relating the tropical parameters from the finite case to the tropicalisations of the Schoenberg parameters. Moreover, we show that our finite type tropical parametrisation map is given by Lusztig's weight map from the theory of canonical bases. This results in a surprising connection between the classical Edrei theorem with its Schoenberg parameters and Lusztig's canonical basis parametrisation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the vertex functions of finite type A bow varieties. Vertex functions are K-theoretic analogs of I-functions, and 3d mirror symmetry predicts that the q-difference equations satisfied by the vertex functions of a variety and its 3d mirror dual are the same after a change of variable swapping the roles of the various parameters. Thus the vertex functions are related by a matrix of elliptic functions, which is expected to be the elliptic stable envelope of M. Aganagic and A. Okounkov. We prove all of these statements. The strategy of our proof is to reduce to the case of cotangent bundles of complete flag varieties, for which the q-difference equations can be explicitly identified with Macdonald difference equations. A key ingredient in this reduction, of independent interest, involves relating vertex functions of the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety with those of a ``finer" flag variety. Our formula involves specializing certain K\"ahler parameters (also called Novikov parameters) to singularities of the vertex functions. In the $\hbar\to \infty$ limit, this statement is expected to degenerate to an analogous result about I-functions of flag varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Assuming the four exponentials conjecture, Hansel and Safer showed that if a subset $S$ of the Gaussian integers is both $\alpha=-m+i $- and $\beta=-n+i$-recognizable, then it is syndetic, and they conjectured that $S$ must be eventually periodic. Without assuming the four exponentials conjecture, we show that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are multiplicatively independent Gaussian integers, and at least one of $\alpha$, $\beta$ is not an $n$-th root of an integer, then any $\alpha$- and $\beta$-automatic configuration is eventually periodic; in particular we prove Hansel and Safer's conjecture. Otherwise, there exist non-eventually periodic configurations which are $\alpha$-automatic for any root of an integer $\alpha$. Our work generalises the Cobham-Semenov theorem to Gaussian numerations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper introduces an archimedean, locally Cantor multi-field $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$ which gives an analog of the $p$-adic number field at a place at infinity of a real quadratic extension $K$ of $\mathbb{Q}$. This analog is defined using a unit $1<\theta\in \mathcal{O}_{K}^{\times}$, which plays the same role as the prime $p$ does in $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$; the elements of $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$ are then greedy Laurent series in the base $\theta$. There is a canonical inclusion of the integers $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ with dense image in $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$ and the operations of sum and product extend to multi-valued operations having at most three values, making $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$ a multi-field in the sense of Marty. We show that the (geometric) completions of 1-dimensional quasicrystals contained in $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ map canonically to $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$. The motivation for this work arises in part from a desire to obtain a more arithmetic treatment of a place at infinity by replacing $\mathbb{R}$ with $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$, with an eye toward obtaining a finer version of class field theory incorporating the ideal arithmetic of quasicrystal rings.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages. Minor improvements in the exposition. To appear in Israel J. Math

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It follows from the Grothendieck-Ogg-Shafarevich formula that the rank of an abelian variety (with trivial trace) defined over the function field of a curve is bounded by a quantity which depends on the genus of the base curve and on bad reduction data. Using a function field version of classical $\ell$-descent techniques, we derive an arithmetic refinement of this bound, extending previous work of the second and third authors from elliptic curves to abelian varieties, and improving on their result in the case of elliptic curves. When the abelian variety is the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve, we produce a more explicit $2$-descent map. Then we apply this machinery to studying points on the Jacobians of certain genus $2$ curves over $k(t)$, where $k$ is some perfect base field of characteristic not $2$.</p></details>

These formulas refine and generalize the classical $\rho$-decomposition of Kostant, and in particular we prove that the characters involved exhibit three structural phenomena: divisibility (by a large power of 2), equidistribution, and uniform factorization formulas.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In order to extend the study of the regular version of the regular inverse Galois problem to skew fields, we generalize the definition of regular field extensions for commutative fields to the case of arbitrary fields. We then propose a general version of the inverse Galois property and show that for a field k, the study of the class InvReg(k) of non-trivial regular extensions of k satisfying this property constitutes a natural generalization of the classical regular inverse Galois problem. Next, we use recent results from Behajaina, Deschamps, and Legrand on the inverse Galois problem in the noncommutative setting to show that certain skew fraction fields h(t, {\sigma}, {\delta}) belong to the class InvReg(h). Finally, we generalize Behajaina's method to construct extensions belonging to InvReg(h) that are not of the form h(t, {\sigma}) with {\sigma} an automorphism of finite order.</p></details>

The proof closely follows and elaborates on a recent argument of D.E. Martin. We expect that there is just one orbit generically.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve with conductor $N=N_+N_-$, where $N_+$ and $N_-$ are coprime and $N_-$ is squarefree. Let $D$ be a positive fundamental discriminant satisfying the modified Heegner hypothesis with respect to $(N_+,N_-)$: primes dividing $N_+$ (resp. $N_-$) split (resp. are inert) in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})$; we denote by $E^D/\mathbb{Q}$ the quadratic twist of $E/\mathbb{Q}$ by $D$. In the first half of the paper we consider the situation where $N_-$ is a squarefree product of an odd number of distinct primes, and we show the following: assuming that $E/\mathbb{Q}$ is of analytic rank zero (resp. one), and that the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer formula holds for $E/\mathbb{Q}$ modulo $(\mathbb{Q}^{\times})^2$, then for those $D$ such that $E^D/\mathbb{Q}$ is of analytic rank one (resp. zero), we also have the validity of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer formula for $E^D/\mathbb{Q}$ modulo $(\mathbb{Q}^{\times})^2$. To show this, we establish auxiliary results without rank assumptions. The most difficult case is when $D$ is even, and our proof crucially relies on the recent classification of how local Tamagawa numbers change under quadratic twists. In the final part of the paper analogous results are also obtained in the other situation when $N_-$ is a squarefree product of an even number distinct primes, concerning the case when both $E/\mathbb{Q}$ and $E^D/\mathbb{Q}$ have analytic rank zero (resp. one). As a consequence of our work, we obtain that if $E/\mathbb{Q}$ is semistable with conductor $N$ and whose analytic rank is at most one, then for any positive fundamental discriminant $D$ that is coprime to $N$, such that $E^D/\mathbb{Q}$ again has analytic rank at most one, we have that the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer formula modulo $(\mathbb{Q}^{\times})^2$ holds for $E/\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if it holds for $E^D/\mathbb{Q}$.</p></details>

Highlights include: asymptotics for cyclics between consecutive squares with a second-order term (Conj.~9), Legendre- and $k$-fold Oppermann-type results in short quadratic intervals (Conj.~6, Conj.~20, and twin cyclics between cubes, Conj.~32), gap and growth analogs (Visser, Rosser, Ishikawa, and a sum-3-versus-sum-2 inequality; Conj.~47,~52,~54,~56), limiting ratios (Vrba and Hassani; Conj.~60,~61), and structure results for Sophie Germain cyclics (Conj.~36,~37). We also resolve two Firoozbakht-type conjectures for cyclics (Conj.~41--42). On the negative side we exhibit counterexamples to the Panaitopol, Dusart, and Carneiro analogs (Conj.~59,~53,~50--51). Finally, for the lexicographically least sequence of pairwise distinct positive integers whose running averages are Fibonacci numbers (\seqnum{A248982}), we give explicit closed forms for all $n$ and prove Fried's Conjecture~2 asserting the disjointness of the parity-defined value sets (equivalently, $F_{n+2}+2nF_{n+1}$ is never a Fibonacci number).

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Stratifying systems, which have been defined for module, triangulated and exact categories previously, were developed to produce examples of standardly stratified algebras. A stratifying system $\Phi$ is a finite set of objects satisfying some orthogonality conditions. One very interesting property is that the subcategory $\mathcal{F}(\Phi)$ of objects admitting a composition series-like filtration with factors in $\Phi$ has the Jordan-H\"{o}lder property on these filtrations. This article has two main aims. First, we introduce notions of subobjects, simple objects and composition series for an extriangulated category, in order to define a Jordan-H\"{o}lder extriangulated category. Moreover, we characterise Jordan-H\"{o}lder, length, weakly idempotent complete extriangulated categories in terms of the associated Grothendieck monoid and Grothendieck group. Second, we develop a theory of stratifying systems in extriangulated categories. We define projective stratifying systems and show that every stratifying system $\Phi$ in an extriangulated category is part of a minimal projective one $(\Phi,Q)$. We prove that $\mathcal{F}(\Phi)$ is a length, Jordan-H\"{o}lder extriangulated category when $(\Phi,Q)$ satisfies a left exactness condition. We give several examples and answer a recent question of Enomoto--Saito in the negative.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the average number of surjections from class groups of quadratic function fields over $\mathbb F_q(t)$ onto finite odd order groups $H$, once $q$ is sufficiently large. These yield the first known moments of these class groups, as predicted by the Cohen--Lenstra heuristics, apart from the case $H = \mathbb Z/3\mathbb Z$. The key input to this result is a topological one, where we compute the stable rational homology groups of Hurwitz spaces associated to non-splitting conjugacy classes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is known that a large class of characters of 2d conformal field theories (CFTs) can be written in the form of a Nahm sum. In \cite{Zagier:2007knq}, D. Zagier identified a list of Nahm sum expressions that are modular functions under a congruence subgroup of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and can be thought of as candidates for characters of rational CFTs. Motivated by the observation that the same formulas appear as the half-indices of certain 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories, we perform a general search over low-rank 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ abelian Chern-Simons matter theories which either flow to unitary TFTs or $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-zero SCFTs in the infrared. These are exceptional classes of 3d theories, which are expected to support rational and $C_2$-cofinite chiral algebras on their boundary. We compare and contrast our results with Zagier's and comment on a possible generalization of Nahm's conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the sequence of the last nonzero digits of factorials in every integer base $b>2$ is not eventually periodic. We also extend the Adamczewski--Bugeaud criterion, originally formulated for integer base expansions, to Cantor base expansions associated with a periodic Cantor base. As an application, we show that a certain real number expressed through a Cantor base expansion is transcendental when the Cantor base and the digit sequence satisfy suitable conditions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $S$ be a semigroup (written multiplicatively). Endowed with the operation of setwise multiplication induced by $S$ on its parts, the non-empty subsets of $S$ form themselves a semigroup, denoted by $\mathcal P(S)$. Accordingly, we say that a semigroup $H$ is globally isomorphic to a semigroup $K$ if $\mathcal P(H)$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal P(K)$; and that a class $\mathscr C$ of semigroups is globally closed if a semigroup in $\mathscr C$ can only be globally isomorphic to an isomorphic copy of a semigroup in the same class. We show that the classes of groups, torsion-free monoids, and numerical monoids are each globally closed. The first result extends a 1967 theorem of Shafer, while the last relies non-trivially on the second and on a classical theorem of Kneser from additive number theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 40 pages. Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Witt algebra $W_{\geq -1}$ is the Lie algebra of algebraic vector fields on a line. We investigate the two-sided ideal structure of its universal enveloping algebra, by studying the orbit homomorphisms $\Psi_n: U(W_{\geq -1}) \rightarrow T_n$, an infinite family of homomorphisms to noncommutative Noetherian algebras. The orbit homomorphisms lift primitive ideals from solvable Lie algebras to $U(W_{\geq -1})$, thereby playing a central role in the orbit method for the Witt algebra. We prove that the kernel of any orbit homomorphism is generated by an infinite set of differentiators as a one-sided ideal, whilst being generated by any single element of this set as a two-sided ideal. One consequence is an explicit description of primitive and semi-primitive ideals of $U(W_{\geq -1})$ corresponding to one-point local functions. We also prove that the image $B_n$ of the nth orbit homomorphism is both non-Noetherian and birational to the Noetherian algebra $T_n$. On the other hand, the degree zero subring of $B_n$ is left and right Noetherian, and we conjecture that the same holds for $U(W_{\geq -1})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be an extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $A/K$ an elliptic curve. If $\mathrm{Gal}(\bar K/K)$ is finitely generated, then $A$ is of infinite rank over $K$. In particular, this implies the $g=1$ case of the Junker-Koenigsmann conjecture. This "anti-Mordellic'' result follows from a new "Mordellic'' theorem, which asserts that if $K_0$ is finitely generated over $\mathbb{Q}$, the points of an abelian variety $A_0/K_0$ over the compositum of all bounded-degree Galois extensions of $K_0$ form a virtually free abelian group. This, in turn, follows from a second Mordellic result, which asserts that the group of $A_0$ over the extension of $K_0$ defined by the torsion of $A_0(\bar K_0)$ is free modulo torsion.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gerard Gonzalo Calbetó &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classification of the finite subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ is a classical problem in the field of finite group theory, dating back to the late 19th century with authors like Klein, Jordan, Blichfeldt, etc. Throughout its long history, many results concerning the classification have been scattered in the mathematical literature. In this survey, we explore many of the most relevant results related to the classification, its structure, and the lists of groups. We mostly focus on the irreducible groups. In particular, classification statements are provided for primitive and imprimitive groups over prime dimension, and quasi-primitive groups of small composite dimension. We also provide tables with a detailed list of all (quasi)-primitive finite groups of dimension $n<8$. Finally, we provide a computer program implementing many of the known results specific to the finite quasisimple irreducible projective groups, to improve and preserve the accessibility to these results and further their classification. See \S 4.2 and [37]. We aim this survey to the non-specialist, so the provided classification results may easily accessible to mathematicians working outside of group theory.</p></details>
