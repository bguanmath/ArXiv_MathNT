### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10780v3'>2507.10780</a>\]&nbsp; **Primes in Arithmetic Progressions to Large Moduli and Siegel Zeroes**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Thomas Wright &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\chi$ be a Dirichlet character mod $D$ with $L(s,\chi)$ its associated $L$-function, and let $\psi(x,q,a)$ be Chebyshev's prime-counting function for primes congruent to $a$ modulo $q$. We show that under the assumption of an exceptional character $\chi$ with $L(1,\chi)=o\left((\log D)^{-5}\right)$, for any $q<x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$, the asymptotic $$\psi(x,q,a)=\frac{\psi(x)}{\phi(q)}\left(1-\chi\left(\frac{aD}{(D,q)}\right)+o(1)\right)$$ holds for almost all $a$ with $(a,q)=1$. We also find that for any fixed $a$, the above holds for almost all $q<x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$ with $(a,q)=1$. Previous prime equidistribution results under the assumption of Siegel zeroes (by Friedlander-Iwaniec and the current author) have found that the above asymptotic holds either for all $a$ and $q$ or on average over a range of $q$ (i.e. for the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture), but only under the assumption that $q<x^{\theta}$ where $\theta=\frac{30}{59}$ or $\frac{16}{31}$, respectively.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hemjyoti Nath, Manjil P. Saikia &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this short note, we prove several infinite family of congruences for some restricted partitions introduced by Pushpa and Vasuki (2022) (thereby, also proving a conjecture of Dasappa et. al. (2023)). We also prove some isolated congruences which seem to have been missed by earlier authors. Our proof techniques uses both elementary means as well as the theory of modular forms.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hung Viet Chu, Rishabh Gulecha, Sicheng Guo, Nathanael Johnson, Steven J. Miller, Yeju Shin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given two relatively prime numbers $a$ and $b$, it is known that exactly one of the two Diophantine equations has a nonnegative integral solution $(x,y)$: $$ ax + by \ =\ \frac{(a-1)(b-1)}{2}\quad \mbox{ and }\quad 1 + ax + by \ =\ \frac{(a-1)(b-1)}{2}. $$ Furthermore, the solution is unique. This paper surveys recent results on finding the solution and determining which equation is used when $a$ and $b$ are taken from certain sequences. We contribute to the literature by finding $(x,y)$ when $a$ and $b$ are consecutive terms of sequences having the Fibonacci recurrence and arbitrary initial terms.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Christian Kassel, Christophe Reutenauer &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In previous work we computed the number $C_n(q)$ of ideals of codimension $n$ of the algebra ${\mathbb{F}}_q[x,y,x^{-1}, y^{-1}]$ of two-variable Laurent polynomials over a finite field: it turned out that $C_n(q)$ is a palindromic polynomial of degree $2n$ in $q$, divisible by $(q-1)^2$. The quotient $P_n(q) = C_n(q)/(q-1)^2$ is a palindromic polynomial of degree $2n-2$. For each $n\geq 1$ let ${\overline{P}}_n(X) \in {\mathbb{Z}}[X]$ be the degree $n-1$ polynomial such that ${\overline{P}}_n(q+q^{-1}) = P_n(q)/q^{n-1}$. In this note we show that for any integer $N$ the integer value ${\overline{P}}_n(N)$ is close to the value at $N$ of the degree $n-1$ polynomial $F_{n-1}(X) = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \, {\overline{T}}_k(X)$, which is a sum of monic versions ${\overline{T}}_k(X)$ of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. We give a precise formula for ${\overline{P}}_n(X)$ as a linear combination of $F_k(X)$'s, each appearance of the latter being parametrized by an odd divisor of $n$. As a consequence, ${\overline{P}}_n(X) = F_{n-1}(X)$ if and only if $n$ is a power of $2$. We exhibit similar formulas for $C_n(q)$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nicola Ottolini &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 26 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $S$ be a smooth irreducible curve defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian scheme over $S$ and $\mathcal{C}$ a curve inside $\mathcal{A}$, both defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. In this paper we prove that the set of points in which $\mathcal{C}$ intersects proper flat subgroup schemes of $\mathcal{A}$ tangentially is finite. The crucial case of elliptic curves already follows from a result by Corvaja, Demeio, Masser and Zannier: in this case we provide an alternative proof using the Pila-Zannier method. Such a proof may lead to an effective result using an effective point-counting theorem. This fits in the framework of the so-called problems of unlikely intersections, and can be seen as a variation of the relative Pink conjecture for abelian varieties.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kaidi Wu, Hongfeng Zhang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop the Bernstein-Zelevinsky theory for quasi-split real classical groups and employ this framework to establish an Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic formula for general linear groups. The key to our approach is establishing the Casselman-Wallach property for the homology of the Jacquet functor, which also provides an affirmative resolution to an open question proposed by A. Aizenbud, D. Gourevitch and S. Sahi. Furthermore, we prove the vanishing of higher extension groups for arbitrary pairs of generic representations, confirming a conjecture of Dipendra Prasad. We also utilize the Bernstein-Zelevinsky theory to establish two additional results: the Leibniz law for the highest derivative and a unitarity criterion for general linear groups. Lastly, we apply the Bernstein-Zelevinsky theory to prove the Hausdorffness and exactness of the twisted homology of split even orthogonal groups.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Cristiana Bertolin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Schanuel Conjecture contains all ``reasonable" statements that can be made on the values of the exponential function. In particular it implies the Lindemann-Weierstrass Theorem. In my Ph.D. I showed that Schanuel Conjecture has a geometrical origin: it is equivalent to the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture applied to a 1-motive without abelian part. In this paper, we state a conjecture in Schanuel style, which will imply conjectures in Lindemann-Weierstrass style, for the semi-elliptic exponential function, that is for the exponential map of an extension G of an elliptic curve E by a multiplicative group. We propose the semi-elliptic Conjecture, which concerns the exponential function, the Weierstrass $\wp,$ $\zeta$ functions and Serre functions. The case of a trivial extension has been treated in \cite{BW}, where we introduced the split semi-elliptic Conjecture. As in Schanuel's case, we expect that the semi-elliptic Conjecture contains all ``reasonable" statements that can be made on the values of the exponential function, of the Weierstrass $\wp$, $\zeta$ functions and of Serre functions. We show that the semi-elliptic Conjecture has a geometrical origin (as Schanuel Conjecture): it is equivalent to the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture applied to a 1-motive whose underlying abelian part is an elliptic curve. We prove the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture for 1-motives defined by an elliptic curve with algebraic invariants and complex multiplication and by torsion points. We introduce the $\sigma$-Conjecture which involves the Weierstrass $\wp$, $\zeta$ and $\sigma$ functions and we show that this conjecture is a consequence of the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture applied to an adequate 1-motive.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14624v2'>2410.14624</a>\]&nbsp; **Sharp bound for the Erdős-Straus non-averaging set problem**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Huy Tuan Pham, Dmitrii Zakharov &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Revised version, 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A set of integers $A$ is non-averaging if there is no element $a$ in $A$ which can be written as an average of a subset of $A$ not containing $a$. We show that the largest non-averaging subset of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ has size $n^{1/4+o(1)}$, thus solving the Erd\H{o}s-Straus problem. We also determine the largest size of a non-averaging set in a $d$-dimensional box for any fixed $d$. Our main tool includes the structure theorem for the set of subset sums due to Conlon, Fox and the first author, together with a result about the structure of a point set in nearly convex position.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Fei Chen, Wen-Wei Li &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 32 pages. Published version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathrm{Mp}(2n)$ be the metaplectic group over a local field $F \supset \mathbb{Q}_p$ defined by an additive character of $F$ of conductor $4\mathfrak{o}_F$. Gan-Savin ($p \neq 2$) and Takeda-Wood ($p=2$) obtained an equivalence between the Bernstein block of $\mathrm{Mp}(2n)$ containing the even (resp. odd) Weil representation and the Iwahori-spherical block of the split $\mathrm{SO}(2n+1)$ (resp. its non-split inner form), by giving an isomorphism between Hecke algebras. We revisit this equivalence from an endoscopic perspective. It turns out that the L-parameters of irreducible representations are preserved, whilst the difference between characters of component groups is governed by symplectic local root numbers.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Emiliano Ambrosi, Nirvana Coppola, Francesc Fité &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Two abelian varieties $A$ and $B$ over a number field $K$ are said to be strongly locally quadratic twists if they are quadratic twists at every completion of $K$. While it was known that this does not imply that $A$ and $B$ are quadratic twists over $K$, the only known counterexamples (necessarily of dimension $\geq 4$) are not geometrically simple. We show that, for every prime $p\equiv 13 \pmod{24}$, there exists a pair of geometrically simple abelian varieties of dimension $p-1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ that are strongly locally quadratic twists but not quadratic twists. The proof is based on Galois cohomology computations and class field theory.</p></details>
