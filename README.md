### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04187v1'>2601.04187</a>\]&nbsp; **On the Strong Unital Property for the Affine VOAs**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Angela Cai &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Representations of vertex operator algebras $V$ (VOAs) have numerous applications, including the construction of sheaves of conformal blocks on moduli spaces of curves. For a $V$-module $W = \oplus W_d$, a sequence of associative algebras $\mathfrak{A}_d$ acts on each graded component $W_d$. When these $d$th-mode transition algebras $\mathfrak{A}_d$ are strongly unital - meaning they are unital with units acting as the identity on $W_d$ - the associated sheaves of conformal blocks are vector bundles rather than merely coherent sheaves. This strong unital property, while difficult to verify in practice, has other important implications as well. Here we construct explicit strong units for $L_{\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}(1,0)$, the simple affine VOA for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at level $1$, and establish that mode transition algebras for universal affine VOAs for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ are never strongly unital at any level $k$ not equal to the critical level $-2$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Koustav Banerjee, Kathrin Bringmann, William J. Keith &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Andrews and Bachraoui considered a generating function $F_{k,m}(q)$ associated with certain two-color partitions, and conjectured that this function has non-negative coefficients for $m=1$. They showed this property for $1 \leq k \leq 4$. In this note, we prove that $F_{k,1}(q)$ has non-negative coefficients for $5 \leq k \leq 10$. Moreover, we show that, as $k\to\infty$, $F_{k,1}(q)$ is related to Ramanujan's third order mock theta function $ω(q)$ and to quotients of certain $q$-binomial coefficients.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Chris Bowman, Zajj Daugherty, Maud De Visscher, Rob Muth, Loic Poulain D'andecy &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct gradings on the simple modules of 2-boundary Temperley--Lieb algebras and symplectic blob algebras by realising the latter algebras as quotients of Varagnolo--Vasserot's orientifold quiver Hecke algebras. We prove that the symplectic blob algebras are graded cellular and provide a conjectural algorithm for calculating their graded decomposition matrices. In doing so, we give the first explicit family of finite-dimensional graded quotients of the orientifold quiver Hecke algebras, providing a new entry point for the structure of these algebras -- in the spirit of Libedinsky--Plaza's ``blob algebra approach'' to modular representation theory.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04008v1'>2601.04008</a>\]&nbsp; **Affine Hecke and Schur algebras of type A without a square root of q**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Rose Berry &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide an affine cellular structure on the extended affine Hecke algebra and affine $q$-Schur algebra of type $A_{n-1}$ that is defined over $\mathbb{Z}\left[q^{\pm1}\right]$, that is, without an adjoined $q^{\frac{1}{2}}$. This is with an eye to applications in the representation theory of $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$ for a $p$-adic field $F$ over coefficient rings in which $p$ is invertible but does not have a square root, which have been a topic of recent interest. This is achieved via a renormalisation of the known affine cellular structure over $\mathbb{Z}\left[q^{\pm\frac{1}{2}}\right]$ at each left and right cell, which is chosen to ensure that the diagonal intersections remain subalgebras and that the left and right cells remain isomorphic. We furthermore show that the affine cellular structure on the Schur algebra has idempotence properties which imply finite global dimension, an important ingredient for the applications to representations of $p$-adic groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study restricted overpartitions and concave compositions. Using q-series transformations, we show that their generating functions are related to modular forms, mock theta functions, false theta functions, and mock Maass theta functions. Moreover, we obtain their asymptotic main terms. We also study related rank statistics.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Consider the subset of a Weyl group with a fixed descent set. For Weyl groups of classical types, we determine the number of two-sided cells this subset intersect. Moreover, we apply this result to prove that certain rational Whittaker polynomials associated with covering groups split over the field of rational numbers.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sota Asai, Osamu Iyama &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 20 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an abelian length category $\mathcal{A}$ with only finitely many isoclasses of simple objects, we have the wall-chamber structure and the TF equivalence on the dual real Grothendieck group $K_0(\mathcal{A})_\mathbb{R}^*=\mathrm{Hom}_\mathbb{R}(K_0(\mathcal{A})_\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$, which are defined by semistable subcategories and semistable torsion pairs in $\mathcal{A}$ associated to elements $θ\in K_0(\mathcal{A})_\mathbb{R}^*$. In this paper, we introduce the $M$-TF equivalence for each object $M \in \mathcal{A}$ as a systematic way to coarsen the TF equivalence. We show that the set $Σ(M)$ of closures of $M$-TF equivalence classes is a finite complete fan in $K_0(\mathcal{A})_\mathbb{R}^*$, and that $Σ(M)$ is the normal fan of the Newton polytope $\mathrm{N}(M)$ in $K_0(\mathcal{A})_\mathbb{R}$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03949v1'>2601.03949</a>\]&nbsp; **Sets of distinct representations of numbers in numeral systems with a natural base and a redundant alphabet**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Mykola Pratsiovytyi, Oleh Vynnyshyn &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we study a numeral system with a natural base $s \geq 2$ and a redundant alphabet $A_r=\{0,1, \dots, r\}$, where $s \leq r \leq 2s-2$. We investigate the topological, metric, and fractal properties of the set of numbers in the interval $\left[0,\frac{r}{s-1}\right]$ that admit a unique representation $x=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{α_n} {s^n}\equivΔ^{r_s}_{α_1α_2...α_n...}$, $α_n\in A_r$. The criterion for the uniqueness of the number representation is established. It is proved that the Hausdorff--Besicovitch dimension of the set of numbers with a unique representation is equal to $\frac{\ln(2s-r-1)}{\ln s}$. An analysis of the quantity of representations of numbers having purely periodic representations with a simple period (a single-digit period) is carried out. It is proved that the set of numbers that admit a continuum of distinct representations has full Lebesgue measure. Conditions for a number to belong to this set are given in terms of one of its representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this short note we study the Hall induction of cotangent representations of reductive groups. We prove its torsion freeness in Borel-Moore homology.

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03910v1'>2601.03910</a>\]&nbsp; **An Algebraic Representation Theorem for Linear GENEOs in Geometric Machine Learning**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Francesco Conti, Patrizio Frosini, Nicola Quercioli &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Geometric and Topological Deep Learning are rapidly growing research areas that enhance machine learning through the use of geometric and topological structures. Within this framework, Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) have emerged as a powerful class of operators for encoding symmetries and designing efficient, interpretable neural architectures. Originally introduced in Topological Data Analysis, GENEOs have since found applications in Deep Learning as tools for constructing equivariant models with reduced parameter complexity. GENEOs provide a unifying framework bridging Geometric and Topological Deep Learning and include the operator computing persistence diagrams as a special case. Their theoretical foundations rely on group actions, equivariance, and compactness properties of operator spaces, grounding them in algebra and geometry while enabling both mathematical rigor and practical relevance. While a previous representation theorem characterized linear GENEOs acting on data of the same type, many real-world applications require operators between heterogeneous data spaces. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a new representation theorem for linear GENEOs acting between different perception pairs, based on generalized T-permutant measures. Under mild assumptions on the data domains and group actions, our result provides a complete characterization of such operators. We also prove the compactness and convexity of the space of linear GENEOs. We further demonstrate the practical impact of this theory by applying the proposed framework to improve the performance of autoencoders, highlighting the relevance of GENEOs in modern machine learning applications.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Version 2: added Theorem C and D, which give more explicit results

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the continuous bounded cohomology of the full automorphism groups of regular trees in all positive degrees, with coefficients arising from any irreducible continuous unitary representations. To the author's knowledge, this seems to be the first instance where the continuous bounded cohomology is determined in all positive degrees with coefficients arising from any irreducible continuous unitary representations without being zero in all cases.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 28 pages. Revised (v4) - substantial changes to control and classicity theorems (using geometry of spherical-level Hilbert variety rather than Iwahori-level), added proof of concentration in one degree for cuspidal complex when $k_2 \ne \{0, 1, 2\}$

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct p-adic Asai L-functions for cuspidal automorphic representations of GL2 / F, where F is a real quadratic field in which p splits.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zhao Yu Ma &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 45 pages, 6 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an equivalence between filtrations of primitive bialgebras and filtrations of factorizable perverse sheaves, generalizing the results obtained by Kapranov-Schechtman. Under this equivalence, we find that the word length filtration of quantum shuffle algebras as defined in Ellenberg-Tran-Westerland corresponds to the codimension filtration of factorizable perverse sheaves. Furthermore, we find that the geometric weight filtration of factorizable perverse sheaves corresponds to a filtration on quantum shuffle algebras which has not been previously defined in the literature, and we call this the algebraic weight filtration. To apply this to Hurwitz spaces, we prove a comparison theorem between the weight filtrations for Hurwitz spaces over $\mathbb F_p$ and $\mathbb C$, generalizing the comparison theorem of Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland. This allows us to determine the cohomological weights for Hurwitz spaces explicitly using the algebraic weight filtration of the corresponding quantum shuffle algebra. As a consequence, we find that most weights of Hurwitz spaces are smaller than expected from cohomological degree, and we prove explicit nontrivial upper bounds for weights in some cases, such as when $G=S_3$ and $c$ is the conjugacy class of transpositions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Inspired by the work of Deninger, we present a formula that relates the Mahler measure of a two-variable variant of cyclotomic polynomial to regulator of class in motivic cohomology associated to cyclotomic fields and linear combination of special values of the derivative of Dirichlet $L$-functions. The formula is derived by studying the Beilinson regulator map applied to systematically constructed elements in the motivic cohomology group. Under linear independence hypothesis on the derivative of partial Dirichlet $L$-values at $s=0$ and $-1$, we study a Galois module structure of the relevant motivic cohomology and obtain the refined identity for a single $L$-value.</p></details>

We also prove many new structural results about these representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(K)$ and their subquotients.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the distribution of the cokernels of random row-sparse integral matrices $A_n$ according to the determinantal measure from a structured matrix $B_n$ with a parameter $k_n \ge 3$. Under a mild assumption on the growth rate of $k_n$, we prove that the distribution of the $p$-Sylow subgroup of the cokernel of $A_n$ converges to that of Cohen--Lenstra for every prime $p$. Our result extends the work of A. Mészáros which established convergence to the Cohen--Lenstra distribution when $p \ge 5$ and $k_n=3$ for all positive integers $n$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we study the structure of the difference set $E - E$ for subsets $E \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2$ of positive upper Banach density. In [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 146 (2018), 3449-3453, Problem 2] Fish asked whether, for every such set $E$, there exists a nonzero integer $k$ such that $$ k \cdot \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \{\, xy : (x,y) \in E - E \,\}. $$ Although this question remains open, we establish a relatively weaker form of this conjecture. Specifically, we prove that there exist infinitely many integers $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ and a sequence $\langle x_n \rangle_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ such that $$ k \cdot FS(\langle x_n \rangle_{n \in \mathbb{N}}) \subseteq \{\, xy : (x,y) \in E - E \,\}, $$ where $FS(\langle x_n \rangle)$ denotes the finite sums set generated by the sequence.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Genqiang Liu, Mingjie Li &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A weight $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$-module with finite-dimensional weight spaces is called a cuspidal module, if every root vector of $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$ acts injectively on it. In \cite{LL}, it has been shown that any block with a generalized central character of the cuspidal $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$-module category is equivalent to a block of the category of finite-dimensional modules over the minimal nilpotent finite $W$-algebra $W(e)$ for $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$. In this paper, using a centralizer realization of $W(e)$ and an explicit embedding $W(e)\rightarrow U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$, we show that every finite-dimensional irreducible $W(e)$-module is isomorphic to an irreducible $W(e)$-quotient module of some finite-dimensional irreducible $\mathfrak{gl}_n$-module. As an application, we can give very explicit realizations of all irreducible cuspidal $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$-modules using finite-dimensional irreducible $\mathfrak{gl}_n$-modules, avoiding using the twisted localization method and the coherent family introduced in \cite{M}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ be subcategories of tensor categories $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$, respectively, both of which are abelian categories with finitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects. We prove that if their derived categories $\mathbf{D}^b(\mathcal{A})$ and $\mathbf{D}^b(\mathcal{B})$ are left triangulated tensor ideals and are equivalent as triangulated $\mathbf{D}^b(\mathcal{C})$-module categories via an equivalence induced by a monoidal triangulated functor $F:\mathbf{D}^b(\mathcal{C})\rightarrow \mathbf{D}^b(\mathcal{D})$, then the original module categories $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are themselves equivalent.

> **Comment:** 18 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a connection between Drinfeld modules and rank metric codes, focusing on the case of semifield codes. Our framework constructs rank metric codes from linear subspaces of endomorphisms of a Drinfeld module, using tools such as characteristic polynomials on Tate modules and the Chebotarev density theorem. We show that Sheekey's construction [She20] fits naturally into this setting, yielding a short conceptual proof of one of his main results. We then give a new construction of infinite families of semifield codes arising from Drinfeld modules defined over finite fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the first moment of cubic Hecke $L$-functions over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ evaluated at any $s$ inside the critical strip. The first moment for $s<\frac{1}{2}$ is particularly interesting, and we show there is a phase transition at $s=\frac{1}{3}$. This extends the analogue result of David-Meisner for the first moment over function fields. As in their work, the computation of the moment at $s=\frac{1}{3}$ relies on a cancellation between two terms which are a priori not related: a main term of the principal sum which comes from cubes, and the contribution from infinitely many residues of Dirichlet series of cubic Gauss sums to the dual sum. The cancellation also improves the error term and exhibits a secondary term for all $s$. In particular, at $s=\frac{1}{2}$, we prove the existence of a secondary term of size $Q^{5/6}$, where the size of the family is $Q$. We conjecture that a similar behaviour would hold for higher order Hecke $L$-functions attached to $\ell^{th}$ order residue symbols, refining a function field conjecture of David and Meisner. The proof follows the steps of writing $L(s,χ)$ as two finite sums with the approximate functional equation. Two main ingredients are then exploited: the bound on the second moment of $L(1/2+it,χ)$ that follows from Heath-Brown's cubic large sieve, and the deep work of Kubota and Patterson which connects the Dirichlet series of cubic Gauss sums to metaplectic forms, and gives a formula for its residues in terms of the Fourier coefficients of metaplectic theta functions. This is only known for cubic Gauss sums, and not for general Gauss sums of order $\ell\geq 4$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates the Waring problem of harmonic polynomials. By characterizing the annihilating ideal of a homogeneous harmonic polynomial, i.e., a real binary form that is in the kernel of the Laplacian, we show that its Waring rank equals its degree. Moreover, we show that any linear form can appear in a minimal Waring decomposition of a homogeneous harmonic polynomial, implying that the forbidden locus is empty. We also provide an explicit algorithm for computing the minimal Waring decompositions.</p></details>

Denote the image set of this polynomial as $V_{f}=\{f(α)\midα\in\mathbb{F}_{q}\}$ and denote the cardinality of this set as $N_{f}$. A much sharper bound for $N_{f}$ is established in this paper. In particular, for any $p\neq 2, 3$, and for nearly every generic quartic polynomial $f \in \mathbb{F}_{q}[x]$, we obtain $$\lvert N_f - \frac{5}{8} q \rvert \leq \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{q} + \frac{3}{4},$$ which holds as a simple corollary of the main result.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Ramanujan's original definition of mock theta functions from 1920 involves their asymptotic behaviors at roots of unity on the boundary of the disk of convergence $|q|<1$. More recently this topic has been related by several authors, including the first author with Ono and Rhoades in 2013, to quantum modular forms, first defined in 2010 by Zagier. In 2021, Lovejoy defined and studied related quantum $q$-series identities, which do not hold as equalities between power series inside the disk $|q|<1$ but which do hold on dense subsets of roots of unity on the boundary. Inspired by this, in our prior joint work from 2024 we further studied quantum $q$-series identities as related to mock theta functions and quantum modular forms; we also defined and studied antiquantum $q$-series identities, between series which are equal inside the disk $|q|<1$ but which hold at dense sets of roots of unity on the boundary for which one of the series diverges and is unnaturally truncated. Here, building from our previous work, we establish antiquantum $q$-series identities for all of Ramanujan's third order mock theta functions. We deduce these results in part by establishing and applying more general identities which are also of independent interest, and by using the theory of modular eta-quotients.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the curves $y^2=x^{2^m} -1$ and $y^2=x^{2^{d}+1}-x$ over the rationals. These curves are related via their associated Jacobian varieties in that the Jacobians of the latter appear as factors of the Jacobians of the former. One of the principal aims of this paper is to fully describe their Sato-Tate groups and distributions by determining generators of the component groups. In order to do this, we first prove the nondegeneracy of the two families of Jacobian varieties via their Hodge groups. We then use results relating Sato-Tate groups and twisted Lefschetz groups of nondegenerate abelian varieties to determine the generators of the associated Sato-Tate groups. The results of this paper add new examples to the literature of families of nondegenerate Jacobian varieties and of noncyclic component groups of Sato-Tate groups. Furthermore, we compute moment statistics associated to the Sato-Tate groups which can be used to verify the equidistribution statement of the generalized Sato-Tate conjecture by comparing them to moment statistics obtained for the traces in the normalized $L$-polynomials of the curves.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we generalize the following problem, which is called the rational angle bisection problem, to the $n$-dimensional space $k^n$ over a subfield $k$ of $\mathbb R$: on the coordinate plane, for which rational numbers $a$ and $b$ are the slopes of the angle bisectors between two lines with slopes $a$ and $b$ rational? First, we give a few characterizations of when the angle bisectors between two lines with direction vectors in $k^n$ have direction vectors in $k^n.$ To find solutions to the problem in the case when $k = \mathbb Q,$ we also give a formula for the integral solutions of $x_1{}^2+\dots +x_n{}^2 = dx_{n+1}{}^2,$ which is a generalization of the negative Pell's equation $x^2-dy^2 = -1,$ where $d$ is a square-free positive integer. Second, by applying the above characterizations, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the incenter of a given $n$-simplex with $k$-rational vertices to be $k$-rational. On the coordinate plane, we prove that every triangle with $k$-rational vertices and incenter can be obtained by scaling a triangle with $k$-rational side lengths and area, which is a generalization of a Heronian triangle. We also state certain fundamental properties of a few centers of a given triangle with $k$-rational vertices.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 29 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Berry and Tabor conjectured in 1977 that spectra of generic integrable quantum systems have the same local statistics as a Poisson point process. We verify their conjecture in the case of the two-point spectral density for a quantum particle in a three-dimensional box, subject to a Diophantine condition on the domain's proportions. A permissible choice of width, height and depth is for example $1,2^{1/3},2^{-1/3}$. This extends previous work of Eskin, Margulis and Mozes (Annals of Math., 2005) in dimension two, where the problem reduces to the quantitative Oppenheim conjecture for quadratic forms of signature $(2,2)$. The difficulty in three and higher dimensions is that we need to consider the distribution of indefinite forms in shrinking rather than fixed intervals, which we are able to resolve for special diagonal forms of signature $(3,3)$ in various scalings, including a rate of convergence. A key step of our approach is to represent the relevant counting problem as an average of a theta function on $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})^3\backslash\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})^3$ over an expanding family of one-parameter unipotent orbits. The asymptotic behaviour of these unipotent averages follows from Ratner's measure classification theorem and subtle escape of mass estimates.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $γ=0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $δ=0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $γ+δ/e=\mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $γ^{(n)}+δ^{(n)}/e=η^{(n)}$, $n\ge0$ for sequences of constants $γ^{(n)}$, $δ^{(n)}$, and $η^{(n)}$ (given respectively by raw, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). Investigating the $γ^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations (where $γ^{(0)}=1$ and $γ^{(1)}=γ$), we find that at least one of the pair {$γ,γ^{(2)}$} and -- conditional on a realistic conjecture verified for $2\leq n\leq26$ -- at least two of each set {$γ,γ^{(n)},γ^{(n+1)},\ldots,γ^{(2n)}$} are transcendental, implying that the $γ^{(n)}$ are transcendental infinitely often (with analogous results for the sequence $Γ^{(n)}(1)=\left(-1\right)^{n}γ^{\left(n\right)}$). We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $η^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent, and therefore transcendental, for all $n\ge0$, implying that at least one of each pair, {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e$} and {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e,δ^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n\ge1$. Further analysis of the $γ^{(n)}$ and $η^{(n)}$ reveals that the values $δ^{(n)}/e$ are transcendental infinitely often with positive asymptotic density. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tildeδ^{(n)}$ and $\tildeη^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $γ^{(n)}+\tildeδ^{(n)}/e=\tildeη^{(n)}$.</p></details>

Minimal generating sets arising in this context throw many surprises compared to the analogous concept in linear algebra: they can be of different cardinalities. In fact we establish that for a certain family of polynomials over the rationals, we have minimal generating sets of all cardinalities in a certain range and that these are the only possible cardinalities for minimal generating set for such a polynomial. We also study how minimal generating sets behave under multiple transitivity of the Galois group and consequently prove the existence of polynomials with all minimal generating sets of uniformly same cardinality. We also connect minimal generating sets with the concept of root cluster tower of an irreducible polynomial introduced by the second author and Krithika in [8].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any compactly generated triangulated category we introduce two topological spaces, the shift-spectrum and the shift-homological spectrum. We use them to parametrise a family of thick subcategories of the compact objects, which we call radical. These spaces can be viewed as non-monoidal analogues of the Balmer and homological spectra arising in tensor-triangular geometry: we prove that for monogenic tensor-triangulated categories the Balmer spectrum is a subspace of the shift-spectrum. To construct these analogues we utilise quotients of the module category, rather than the lattice theoretic methods which have been adopted in other approaches. We characterise radical thick subcategories and show in certain cases, such as the perfect derived categories of tame hereditary algebras or monogenic tensor-triangulated categories, that every thick subcategory is radical. We establish a close relationship between the shift-homological spectrum and the set of irreducible integral rank functions, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for every radical thick subcategory to be given by an intersection of kernels of rank functions. In order to facilitate these results, we prove that both spaces we introduce may equivalently be described in terms of the Ziegler spectrum.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the differential and boomerang properties of a class of binomial $F_{r,u}(x) = x^r(1 + uχ(x))$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, where $r = \frac{p^n+1}{4}$, $p^n \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$, and $χ(x) = x^{\frac{p^n -1}{2}}$ is the quadratic character in $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$. We show that $F_{r,\pm1}$ is locally-PN with boomerang uniformity $0$ when $p^n \equiv 3 \pmod{8}$. To the best of our knowledge, it is the second known non-PN function class with boomerang uniformity $0$, and the first such example over odd characteristic fields with $p > 3$. Moreover, we show that $F_{r,\pm1}$ is locally-APN with boomerang uniformity at most $2$ when $p^n \equiv 7 \pmod{8}$. We also provide complete classifications of the differential and boomerang spectra of $F_{r,\pm1}$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Previous research on exceptional units has primarily focused on the ring of rational integers or abstract finite rings, often restricted to linear or quadratic constraints. In this paper, we extend the concept of polynomial-type exceptional units to the ring of integers of an arbitrary algebraic number field. We investigate the number of these polynomial-type exceptional units on general algebraic varieties. By employing the Chinese Remainder Theorem and Hensel's lifting technique, we derive an exact counting formula for the number of these exceptional units on a smooth closed subscheme under the assumption of good reduction. Furthermore, using the Lang-Weil inequality, we establish an asymptotic estimate for the counting function. In particular, we prove that for varieties of degree at most two, the error term can be significantly improved, yielding a sharper asymptotic bound.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The action of the cactus group $C_n$ on Young tableaux of a given shape $λ$ goes back to Berenstein and Kirillov and arises naturally in the study of crystal bases and quantum integrable systems. We show that this action is $2$-transitive on standard Young tableaux of the shape $λ$ if and only if $λ$ is not self-transpose and not a single hook. Moreover, we show that in these cases, the image of the cactus group in the permutation group of standard Young tableaux is either the whole permutation group or the alternating group, and prove that both cases are possible for infinitely many $λ$ (though the alternating group is more frequent). As an application, this implies that the Galois group of solutions to the Bethe ansatz in the Gaudin model attached to the Lie group $GL_d$ is, in many cases, at least the alternating group. This also extends the results of Sottile and White on the multiple transitivity of the Galois group of Schubert calculus problems in Grassmannians to many new cases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Symmetric quiver varieties with potentials are natural generalizations of Nakajima quiver varieties, and their equivariant critical cohomologies provide more flexible settings for geometric representation theory and enumerative geometry. In this paper, we study their geometric properties and show that they behave like universally deformed Nakajima quiver varieties. Based on this, we provide a new proof of the existence of critical stable envelopes on them. Following an idea of Nakajima, we give a sheaf theoretic interpretation of critical stable envelopes by the hyperbolic restriction in the affinization of symmetric quiver varieties. The associativity of hyperbolic restrictions implies the triangle lemma of critical stable envelopes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $b>0$ and $n\geqslant 1$, we consider the $n\times n$ tridiagonal matrix $V_n(b)$ with diagonal entries $b+1$, superdiagonal entries $1$, and subdiagonal entries $b$. A diagonal similarity reduces $V_n(b)$ to a symmetric tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix and hence makes its spectrum explicit. Since $\det\left(V_n(b)\right)$ equals the geometric sum $1+b+\cdots+b^{n}$, taking determinants yields a finite cosine product evaluation for this quantity. As further consequences, we derive sharp bounds from the extremal eigenvalues, write down explicit eigenvectors with respect to a natural weighted inner product, and obtain a closed formula for $V_n(b)^{-1}$.</p></details>

It generalizes orbit mutations arising from quiver coverings and allows for infinite mutation sequences even when orbit mutations are obstructed. We further construct quivers with homotopies from triangulations of marked surfaces with colored punctures, and prove that flips correspond to mutations, extending the Fomin-Shapiro-Thurston model to the setting with 2-cycles.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Minor corrections. An error in the proof of Proposition 8.26 was fixed

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop the theory of "virtual morphisms" in logarithmic algebraic geometry, introduced by Howell. It allows one to give algebro-geometric meaning to various useful maps of topological spaces that do not correspond to morphisms of (log) schemes in the classical sense, while retaining functoriality of key constructions. In particular, we explain how virtual morphisms provide a natural categorical home for Deligne's theory of tangential basepoints: the latter are simply the virtual morphisms from a point. We also extend Howell's results on the functoriality of Betti and de Rham cohomology. Using this framework, we lift the topological operad of little $2$-disks to an operad in log schemes over the integers, whose virtual points are isomorphism classes of stable marked curves of genus zero equipped with a tangential basepoint. The gluing of such curves along marked points is performed using virtual morphisms that transport tangential basepoints around the curves. This builds on Vaintrob's analogous construction for framed little disks, for which the classical notion of morphism in logarithmic geometry sufficed. In this way, we obtain a direct algebro-geometric proof of the formality of the little disks operad, following the strategy envisioned by Beilinson. Furthermore, Bar-Natan's parenthesized braids naturally appear as the fundamental groupoids of our moduli spaces, with all virtual basepoints defined over the integers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish improved bounds for bilinear forms with Kloosterman fractions of the form ${\sum\sum}_{m,n} α_m β_n e(a\overline{m}/(bn))$ with $M<m\le 2M$, $N < n \le 2N$ and $(m,n)=1$. Our approach works directly with arbitrary coefficient sequences $(α_m), (β_n) \in \mathbb{C}$, avoiding the temporary restriction to squarefree support used in prior work. While this requires handling additional arithmetic complexity, it yields strictly stronger bounds that improve upon the estimates of Duke, Friedlander, and Iwaniec \cite{DFI} and Bettin-Chandee \cite{BC}; in the balanced case $M \approx N$, the new saving over the trivial bound is $1/12$%, compared to $1/48$ in \cite{DFI} . As an application, we prove a generalized asymptotic formula for the twisted second moment of the Riemann zeta-function with Dirichlet polynomials of length $T^{1/2+δ}$ for $δ= 1/46$, extending beyond the previously limiting $θ= 1/2$ barrier established by Bettin, Chandee, and Radziwiłł \cite{BCR}. We also establish bounds for related Hermitian sums involving Salié-type exponential phases and develop techniques for more general bilinear forms with Kloosterman fractions.</p></details>

The discrepancy of $\mathcal{P}$ with respect to $C$ is defined as \begin{equation*} \mathcal{D}(\mathcal{P},\, C)=\sum_{\mathbf{p}\in\mathcal{P}}\sum_{\mathbf{n}\in\mathbb{Z}^2}\mathds{1}_C(\mathbf{p}+\mathbf{n})-N|C|. \end{equation*} A standard approach for estimating how a point distribution deviates from uniformity is to average the latter quantity over a family of sets; in particular, when considering quadratic averages over translations and dilations, one obtains \begin{equation*} \mathcal{D}_2(\mathcal{P},\, C)=\int_{0}^{1}\int_{[0,1)^2}\left|\mathcal{D}( \mathcal{P},\,\boldsymbolτ+δC)\right|^2\,{\rm d}\boldsymbolτ\,{\rm d} δ. \end{equation*} This paper concerns the behaviour of optimal \textit{homothetic quadratic discrepancy} \begin{equation*} \inf_{\# \mathcal{P}=N} \mathcal{D}_2(\mathcal{P},\, C)\quad\text{as}\quad N\to+\infty. \end{equation*} Beck and Chen \cite{MR1489133} showed that the optimal \textit{h.q.d.} of convex polygons has an order of growth of $\log N$. More recently, Brandolini and Travaglini \cite{MR4358540} showed that the optimal \textit{h.q.d.} of planar convex bodies has an order of growth of $N^{1/2}$ if their boundary is $\mathcal{C}^2$, and of $N^{2/5}$ if their boundary is only piecewise-$\mathcal{C}^2$ and not polygonal. We show that, in general, no order of growth is required. First, by an implicit geometric construction, we show that one can obtain prescribed oscillations from a logarithmic order of $\log N$ to polynomial orders of $N^{2/5}$ and $N^{1/2}$, and vice versa.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the relationship between the representation theory of the quantum affine algebra $\mathcal{U}_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_\infty})$ of infinite rank, and that of the quantum toroidal algebra $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_{2n,\mathrm{tor}})$. Using monoidal categorifications due to Hernandez-Leclerc and Nakajima, we establish a cluster-theoretic interpretation of the folding map $φ_{2n}$ of $q$-characters, introduced by Hernandez. To this end, we introduce a notion of foldability for cluster algebras arising from infinite quivers and study a specific case of cluster algebras of type $A_\infty$. Using this interpretation of $φ_{2n}$, we prove a conjecture of Hernandez in new cases. Finally, we study a particular simple $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_{2n,\mathrm{tor}})$-module whose $q$-character is not a cluster variable, and conjecture that it is imaginary.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Based on the pioneering ideas of Kashaev [Kas98,Kas00], we present a fully explicit construction of a finite-dimensional projective representation of the dotted Ptolemy groupoid when the quantum parameter $q$ is a root of unity, which reproduces the central charge of the $SU(2)$ Wess--Zumino--Witten model. A basic ingredient is the cyclic quantum dilogarithm [FK94]. A notable contribution of this work is a reinterpretation of the relations among the parameters in the cyclic quantum dilogarithm to ensure its pentagon identity in terms of the mutations of coefficients. In particular, we find the dual roles of these parameters: as coefficients in quantum cluster algebras and as the central characters of quantum cluster variables. We also provide a geometric method to decompose the space of quantum states into irreducible modules of the Chekhov--Fock algebra. We introduce two versions of quantum intertwiners associated with a mapping class: on the entire representation space and on each irreducible component, each being an explicit composite of cyclic quantum dilogarithm operators. We prove that the former gives an intertwiner of local representations of quantum Teichmüller space in the sense of Bai--Bonahon--Liu [BBL07], and also coincides with the transpose of the reduced quantum hyperbolic operator of Baseilhac--Benedetti [BB18]. The mutation relation of coefficients is equivalent to the quantum gluing equation. The irreducible intertwiner conjecturally coincides with the Bonahon--Liu intertwiner [BL07], and we give a partial evidence.</p></details>

Next, we give various constructions of modified Rota-Baxter operators of non-zero weight according to constructions of $3$-Lie algebras. Furthermore, we define a cohomology of modified Rota-Baxter operators of non-zero weight on $3$-Lie algebras with coefficients in a suitable representation. As an application, we study formal deformations of modified Rota-Baxter operators of non-zero weight that are generated by the above-defined cohomology. In the final part of the paper, we construct two \(L_\infty[1]\)-algebra structures whose Maurer-Cartan elements correspond to relative and absolute modified Rota-Baxter \(3\)-Lie algebra structures of nonzero weight, respectively. Lastly, we compare our \(L_\infty[1]\)-algebraic approach with the deformation-controlling \(L_\infty[1]\)-algebra for relative Rota-Baxter \(3\)-Lie operators developed by Hou, Sheng, and Zhou.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We completely classify Laurent series converging on the unit circle over a non-Archimedean local field (of any characteristic) that map infinitely many roots of unity to roots of unity. For a given Laurent series $f$ over a field of positive characteristic with residue field $\mathbb{F}_q$, we prove effective bounds for the number of possible roots of unity in terms of the number of zeroes of the auxilliary function $f(x^q)-f(x)^q$ on the unit circle. In characteristic $0$ our bound is still effective but also depends on the ramification degree of the base field over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ as well as the size of the coefficients of $f$. This has applications to the Manin-Mumford conjecture in $\mathbb{G}_m^2$. In characteristic $0$, this work builds upon a pigeon-hole based method by Schmidt.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a problem with three equivalent formulations: describing Gibbs measures for five-vertex model in quadrant; classifying coherent systems on a p-deformation of the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph related to Grothendieck polynomials; finding the Martin boundary for discrete time TASEP with p-geometric jumps. We find a wide family of the Gibbs measures, parameterized by certain analytic functions. A subset of our measures have probabilistic interpretation as interacting particle systems with fixed particles speeds. In contrast to previous related boundary problems, we find that admissible speeds are not arbitrary, but must be larger than $\frac{p}{1-p}$. For this subset we further establish Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem, connecting the fluctuations to families of independent GUE eigenvalues. As a consequence, the measures from the subset are extreme points of the Martin boundary. It remains open whether our list of measures is exhaustive.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the following problem: what is the smallest possible distance between a cubic irrational $ξ$ and a rational number $p/q$ in terms of the height $H(ξ)$ and $q$? More precisely, we consider the set $D_{3,1}$ consisting of all pairs $(u,v)$ of positive real numbers such that $|ξ- p/q| > cH^{-u}(ξ)q^{-v}$ for all cubic irrationals $ξ$ and rationals $p/q$. First, we transform this problem into one about the root separation of cubic polynomials. Second, under the assumption of the famous abc-conjecture, we give an almost complete description of $D_{3,1}$. Namely, the points $(u,v)$ with $2\le v\le 3$ that lie in the interior of $D_{3,1}$ are characterised by the inequality $u> 10-3v$. Assuming only the weaker Hall conjecture, we also obtain nontrivial results about the shape of $D_{3,1}$, although these are not as strong as those derived from the abc-conjecture. Finally, we discuss an analogue of the set $D_{3,1}$ in function fields where we are able to give an almost complete description unconditionally.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we develop a quantitative inverse theory for the Gowers uniformity norm $\|\cdot\|_{\mathsf{U}^4}$ in general finite abelian groups. We identify a new type of obstructions to uniformity, which we call almost-cubic polynomials. An almost-cubic polynomial $q$ on a Bohr set $B(Γ, ρ_0)$ is a function such that, for each $ρ\leq \min\{ρ_0, 1/8\}$, we have $$\|Δ_{a,b,c,d} q(x)\|_{\mathbb{T}} \leq 2^{10} ρ$$ for all $x, a,b,c,d \in B(Γ, ρ)$. Let $f : G \to \mathbb{D}$ be a function with $\|f\|_{\mathsf{U}^4} \geq c$. We prove quasipolynomial inverse theorems: $\bullet$ when $(|G|, 6) = 1$, there exists an almost-cubic $q : B(Γ, ρ)$ for $|Γ| \leq \log^{O(1)} c^{-1}$ and $ρ\geq \exp(-\log^{O(1)} c^{-1})$, and an element $t \in G$ such that $$\Big|\sum_{x \in G} 1_{B}(x) f(x + t) \mathrm{e}(q(x))\Big| \geq \exp(-\log^{O(1)} c^{-1})|G|,$$ $\bullet$ when $G = (\mathbb{Z}/2^d\mathbb{Z})^n$, there exists a cubic polynomial $q : G \to \mathbb{T}$ such that $$\Big|\sum_{x \in G} f(x)\mathrm{e}(q(x))\Big| \geq \exp(-\log^{O_d(1)} c^{-1})|G|.$$ Almost-cubic polynomials are rather rigid and we exhibit a strong connection with generalized polynomials in the case of cyclic groups, as well as with polynomials in the classical sense in the case of finite vector spaces. We also answer a question of Jamneshan, Shalom and Tao concerning the inverse theory in groups of bounded torsion. The central result from which the inverse theorems follow is a structural result for Freiman bihomomorphisms in general finite abelian groups. In our proof, we generalize methods of our previous work in the case of finite vector spaces and introduce novel ideas concerning extensions of Freiman bihomomorphisms. In the problem of extension of Freiman bihomomorphisms, genuinely new phenomena appear in general finite abelian groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In $2003$, Pei and Wang introduced higher level analogs of the classical Cohen--Eisenstein series. In recent joint work with Beckwith, we found a weight $\frac{1}{2}$ sesquiharmonic preimage of their weight $\frac{3}{2}$ Eisenstein series under $ξ_{\frac{1}{2}}$ utilizing a construction from seminal work by Duke, Imamoglu and Tóth. In further joint work with Beckwith, when restricting to prime level, we realized our preimage as a regularized Siegel theta lift and evaluated its (regularized) Fourier coefficients explicitly. This relied crucially on work by Bruinier, Funke and Imamoglu. In this paper, we extend both works to higher weights. That is, we provide a harmonic preimage of Pei and Wang's generalized Cohen--Eisenstein series under $ξ_{\frac{3}{2}-k}$, where $k > 1$. Furthermore, when restricting to prime level, we realize them as outputs of a regularized Shintani theta lift of a higher level holomorphic Eisenstein series, which builds on recent work by Alfes and Schwagenscheidt. Lastly, we evaluate the regularized Millson theta lift of a higher level Maass--Eisenstein series, which is known to be connected to the Shintani theta lift by a differential equation by earlier work of Alfes and Schwagenscheidt.</p></details>
