 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Benjamin V. Holt &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** The last section was expanded to include more details about future research directions

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A permutiple is a natural number whose representation in some base is an integer multiple of a number whose representation has the same collection of digits. A previous paper utilizes a finite-state-machine construction and its state graph to recognize permutiples and to generate new examples. Permutiples are associated with walks on the state graph which necessarily satisfy certain conditions. However, the above effort does not provide sufficient conditions for the existence of permutiples. In this paper, we provide such a condition which we will state using the language of multigraphs.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Benjamin V. Holt &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** The title was changed again to further clarify the topic of the paper

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A permutiple is a natural number whose representation in some base, $b>1$, is an integer multiple of a number whose base-$b$ representation has the same collection of digits. Previous efforts have made progress in finding such numbers using graph-theoretical and finite-state-machine constructions. These are the mother graph and the Hoey-Sloane machine. In this paper, we leverage the inherent symmetry of the above constructions for the purpose of finding new permutiples from old. Such results also help us to see previous work through a new lens.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Peter Crooks, Rebecca Goldin, Yiannis Loizides &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.SG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Symplectic slice theorems elucidate the local structure of symplectic manifolds carrying Hamiltonian actions of compact Lie groups. We generalize these theorems in two natural settings. The first is based on the idea that complex reductive algebraic groups are the natural complex-geometric counterparts of compact Lie groups. Using new definitions of Poisson and symplectic slices, we prove analogues of the classical symplectic slice theorems for Hamiltonian actions of complex reductive algebraic groups. These analogues have versions in the complex-algebraic and holomorphic categories, and make extensive use of Slodowy slices and decomposition classes in complex reductive Lie algebras. The starting point for our second setting is the fact that Hamiltonian Lie group actions are special cases of Hamiltonian symplectic groupoid actions. We generalize the classical symplectic slice theorems to the latter case.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Il-Seung Jang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 28 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the prefundamental modules $L_{s,a}^{\pm}$ over the Borel subalgebras of the twisted quantum loop algebras, which are introduced by Wang. A character formula for $L_{s,a}^{\pm}$ is obtained from that for the prefundamental modules over the untwisted quantum loop algebras by applying a character folding map. This allows us to realize minuscule prefundamental modules $L_{s,a}^{\pm}$ for types $A_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ and $D_{n+1}^{(2)}$ in terms of the unipotent quantum coordinate ring associated with the fundamental $s$-th coweight, where $s = 1$ for type $A_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ and $s = n$ for type $D_{n+1}^{(2)}$. This result is a continuation of the realization of (co)minuscule prefundamental modules established by earlier works [J-Kwon-Park, Int. Math. Res. Not., 2023] and [J-Kwon-Park, J. Algebra, 2025].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the distributional behavior of additive arithmetic functions evaluated at integers drawn from the harmonic distribution. Our main result shows that a broad family of such functions converges in law to conditioned Dickman-type limits. This contrasts with the Gaussian limits of the classical Erdös-Kac theorem for uniform samples. Our perspective combines the probabilistic representation of harmonic samples via independent geometric variables with analytic inputs such as Mertens' approximation, together with a Poissonization procedure</p></details>

> **Comment:** 16 pages. Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a central limit theorem of $(1/\sqrt{h_p})\sum_{X< n \leq X+h_p}\big(\tfrac{n}{p}\big)$ for almost all the primes $p$, with $X$ uniformly random in $[g(p)]$, $g(p)$ an arbitrary divergent function growing slower than any power of $p$, provided $(\log h_p)/(\log g(p))\rightarrow 0, \, h_p \rightarrow \infty$ as $p \rightarrow \infty$. This improves the recent results of Basak, Nath and Zaharescu, who established this for $g(p) = (\log p)^A, A>1$. We also use the best currently available tools to expand the original central limit theorem of Davenport and Erdős for all the primes to a shorter interval of starting points. In this paper we exploit a Selberg's sieve argument, recently used by Harper, an intersection result due to Evertse and Silverman and some consequences of the Weil bound on general character sums.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper provides the technical tools needed in ongoing work of the authors to compute p-adic étale Abel-Jacobi maps in order to obtain explicit reciprocity laws for GSp4. In particular, we define and study syntomic polynomial cohomology for filtered Frobenius log-isocrystals over proper and semistable schemes over the ring of integers of a local field, with smooth generic fiber, endowed with horizontal divisors. We introduce syntomic polynomial cohomology with support, we define Kunneth morphisms, trace maps and cup products, Gysin maps with respect to divisors and we study some of their properties. We establish the relation with Hyodo-Kato cohomology of the special fiber and de Rham cohomology of the generic fiber. We also introduce overconvergent variants with and without support by restricting to open smooth formal subschemes. Most of all, in case that the filtered log-isocrystal is associated to a p-adic local system on the generic fiber, we establish comparison morphisms between étale and syntomic cohomology and compatibilities with Hochschild-Serre morphisms and between Gysin morphisms.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00263v2'>2512.00263</a>\]&nbsp; **A Uniform Rewriting Algorithm for Twisted Tensor Representations of Finite General Linear Groups**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Dang Vo Phuc &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 23 pages. The author welcomes comments and suggestions for improvement

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $q=p^f$ be a prime power and let $H$ be a classical group of type $A$, so $H \cong \mathrm{SL}_d(q)$ or $\mathrm{GL}_d(q)$, acting on its natural module $V$ of dimension $d$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Let $W$ be an absolutely irreducible $\mathbb{F}_qH$--module such that, over an algebraic closure, $W$ is isomorphic (up to Frobenius twists) to a tensor product $\bigotimes_{t=1}^r L(λ^{(t)})$, where each $L(λ^{(t)})$ is an irreducible polynomial representation of $\mathrm{GL}_d$ of degree $k_t$, and the total degree $K=\sum_t k_t$ satisfies $K<q-1$. We prove a base-$q$ injectivity lemma which shows that, for a Singer cycle $s \in H$, the eigenvalues of $s$ on $W \otimes_{\mathbb{F}_q} \mathbb{F}_{q^d}$ are parametrised by digit vectors of length $d$ with entries bounded by $K$. In particular, distinct weights of $W$ correspond to distinct eigenvalues. If in addition $W$ is multiplicity-free for the diagonal torus of $\mathrm{GL}_d$, then every eigenspace of $s$ is one-dimensional, so $s$ has a simple spectrum on $W$. Using this spectral property we design a Las Vegas rewriting algorithm which, given $G \leq \mathrm{GL}(W)$ isomorphic to $H$ and acting irreducibly on $W$, constructs a projective representation of $G$ of degree $d$ equivalent to the natural representation of $H$. The expected running time is polynomial in $d$, $\log q$ and $K$, and in the cost of field operations and discrete logarithm computations in $\mathbb{F}_{q^d}$. This extends earlier rewriting algorithms of Magaard--O'Brien--Seress and of Gül--Ankaralıoğlu to a broader class of twisted tensor products of polynomial modules.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jan-Willem van Ittersum, Lukas Mauth, Ken Ono, Ajit Singh &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Paper revised to address minor referee comments

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>MacMahon's partition functions and their extensions provide equations that identify prime numbers as solutions. These results depend on the theory of (mixed weight) quasimodular forms on $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$. Two of the authors, along with Craig, conjectured an explicit description of the set of prime-detecting quasimodular forms in terms of Eisenstein series and their derivatives. Kane et al.\ recently verified this conjecture using analytic methods. We offer an alternative proof using the theory of $\ell$-adic Galois representations associated to modular forms.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** J E Cremona &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 14 pages. Mostly minor revisions from v2, with added application to explicit construction of cubic extensions of number fields

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the question of determining whether two binary cubic forms over an arbitrary field $K$ whose characteristic is not $2$ or $3$ are equivalent under the actions of either GL$(2,K)$ or SL$(2,K)$, deriving two necessary and sufficient criteria for such equivalence in each case. One of these involves an algebraic invariant of binary cubic forms which we call the Cardano invariant, which is closely connected to classical formulas and also appears in the work of Bhargava et al. The second criterion is expressed in terms of the base field itself, and also gives explicit matrices in SL$(2,K)$ or GL$(2,K)$ transforming one cubic into the other, if any exist, in terms of the coefficients of bilinear factors of a bicovariant of the two cubics. We also consider automorphisms of a single binary cubic form, show how to use our results to test equivalence of binary cubic forms over an integral domain such as~$\mathbb{Z}$, and briefly recall some connections between binary cubic forms and the arithmetic of elliptic curves. The methods used are elementary, and similar to those used in our earlier work with Fisher concerning equivalences between binary quartic forms.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages. Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, by using the arithmetic theory of ternary quadratic forms, we study some refinements on Lagrange's four-square theorem. For example, given positive integers $a,b$ satisfying some algebraic conditions and a positive integer $C\ge3$, we will show that for any sufficiently large integer $n$ with $\ord_2(n)\le C$, there exist non-negative integers $x,y,z,w$ such that $$ \begin{cases} x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2=n, ax+by\in\mathcal{S}, \end{cases} $$ where $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of all squares over $\mathbb{Z}$. In particular, we obtain some progress on Zhi-Wei Sun's $x+24y$ conjecture.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jiaxu Hu, Kenneth J. Roche &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** cs.IT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables. Interactive demo: https://sltracer.github.io/ECC_Paper_Website_Demo/index_SEC_TED_en.html

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a simple $q$-ary family of single-error-correcting, double-error-detecting (SEC--DED) linear codes whose parity checks are tied directly to the base-$p$ ($q=p$ prime) digits of the coordinate index. For blocklength $n=p^r$ the construction uses only $r+1$ parity checks -- \emph{near-Hamming} overhead -- and admits an index-based decoder that runs in a single pass with constant-time location and magnitude recovery from the syndromes. Based on the prototype, we develop two extensions: Code A1, which removes specific redundant trits to achieve higher information rate and support variable-length encoding; and Code A2, which incorporates two group-sum checks together with a 3-wise XOR linear independence condition on index subsets, yielding a ternary distance-4 (SEC--TED) variant. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the framework generalizes via $n$-wise XOR linearly independent sets to construct codes with distance $d = n + 1$, notably recovering the ternary Golay code for $n = 5$ -- showing both structural generality and a serendipitous link to optimal classical codes. Our contribution is not optimality but \emph{implementational simplicity} and an \emph{array-friendly} structure: the checks are digitwise and global sums, the mapping from syndromes to error location is explicit, and the SEC--TED upgrade is modular. We position the scheme against classical $q$-ary Hamming and SPC/product-code baselines and provide a small comparison of parity overhead, decoding work, and two-error behavior.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the irreducible smooth $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_{2}$-modules recently constructed in arXiv:2404.03855, and demonstrate that these modules admit a Wakimoto-type realization at both critical and non-critical levels. In the critical level case, we identify simple quotients of these modules with the Wakimoto modules whose irreducibility was already established in arXiv:math/0602181, arXiv:1402.6100. We also generalize some Wakimoto modules constructed in arXiv:1409.5354 and identify them as generalized Whittaker modules.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a connected linear algebraic group over a number field $K$. In this article, we study the almost strong approximation property (ASA) of $G$ raised by Rapinchuk and Tralle. Building on Demarche's results on strong approximation with Brauer-Manin obstruction, we introduce a necessary and sufficient condition for (ASA) to hold in terms of the Brauer group of $G$. Using the criteria, we conclude that (ASA) can be completely controlled by the Dirichlet density of the places and the splitting field of $G$, which generalizes a result of Rapinchuk and Tralle.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04639v2'>2411.04639</a>\]&nbsp; **Complexity theory of orbit closure intersection for tensors: reductions, completeness, and graph isomorphism hardness**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Vladimir Lysikov, Michael Walter &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** cs.CC &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 26 pages, 4 figures. Accepted to FOCS 2025

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Many natural computational problems in computer science, mathematics, physics, and other sciences amount to deciding if two objects are equivalent. Often this equivalence is defined in terms of group actions. A natural question is to ask when two objects can be distinguished by polynomial functions that are invariant under the group action. For finite groups, this is the usual notion of equivalence, but for continuous groups like the general linear groups it gives rise to a new notion, called orbit closure intersection. It captures, among others, the graph isomorphism problem, noncommutative PIT, null cone problems in invariant theory, equivalence problems for tensor networks, and the classification of multiparty quantum states. Despite recent algorithmic progress in celebrated special cases, the computational complexity of general orbit closure intersection problems is currently quite unclear. In particular, tensors seem to give rise to the most difficult problems. In this work we start a systematic study of orbit closure intersection from the complexity-theoretic viewpoint. To this end, we define a complexity class TOCI that captures the power of orbit closure intersection problems for general tensor actions, give an appropriate notion of algebraic reductions that imply polynomial-time reductions in the usual sense, but are amenable to invariant-theoretic techniques, identify natural tensor problems that are complete for TOCI, including the equivalence of 2D tensor networks with constant physical dimension, and show that the graph isomorphism problem can be reduced to these complete problems, hence GI$\subseteq$TOCI. As such, our work establishes the first lower bound on the computational complexity of orbit closure intersection problems, and it explains the difficulty of finding unconditional polynomial-time algorithms beyond special cases, as has been observed in the literature.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Added Corollary 5.7 and Theorem 6.2 (that was conjectured in version 1) and following remarks. Corrected typos

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a definition of Coxeter-Dynkin algebras of canonical type generalising the definition as a path algebra of a quiver. Moreover, we construct two tilting objects over the squid algebra - one via generalised APR-tilting and one via one-point-extensions and reflection functors - and identify their endomorphism algebras with the Coxeter-Dynkin algebra. This shows that our definition gives another representative in the derived equivalence class of the squid algebra, and hence of the corresponding canonical algebra. Finally, we have a closer look at the Grothendieck group and the Euler form which illustrates the connection to Saito's classification of marked extended affine root systems. On the other hand, this enables us to prove that in the domestic case Coxeter-Dynkin algebras are of finite representation type.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent article, Iyama and Marczinzik showed that a lattice is distributive if and only if the incidence algebra is Auslander regular, giving a new connection between homological algebra and lattice theory. In this article we study when a distributive lattice has a pure minimal injective coresolution, a notion first introduced and studied in a work of Ajitabh, Smith and Zhang. We will see that this problem naturally leads to studying when certain antichain modules are perfect modules. We give a classification of perfect antichain modules under the assumption that their canonical antichain resolution is minimal and use this to give a completion classification in lattice theoretic terms of incidence algebras of distributive lattices with pure minimal injective coresolution. We use our results to answer a question raised by Ajitabh, Smith and Zhang by showing that there exist Auslander-Gorenstein polynomial identity rings without a pure injective coresolution.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, for a given Dirichlet character mod $N$ with $4\nmid N$, we give a lower bound of order $\sqrt{s/\log(s)}$ for the dimension of the $\mathbb{Q}(e^{2iπ/N})$-vector space spanned by the values of its $L$-function at integers $\leq s$ of a given parity. We thus generalize a result Fischler proved in 2021, corresponding to the principal character mod 1. To this end, we construct linear combinations of these values of $L$-function with a refined version of Siegel's lemma, and we apply to them a linear independence criterion generalizing the one used by Fischler. To check the assumptions of this criterion, we rely on a ``Shidlovskii's lemma''.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider mod $p$ Hilbert modular forms for a totally real field $F$, viewed as sections of automorphic line bundles on Hilbert modular varieties in prime characteristic $p$. For a Hecke eigenform of arbitrary weight, we prove the existence of an associated two-dimensional representation of the absolute Galois group of $F$. Furthermore, for any such irreducible Galois representation, we formulate a conjecture predicting the set of weights of eigenforms from which it arises. This generalizes Edixhoven's variant of the weight part of Serre's Conjecture (in the case $F = \mathbb{Q}$), and removes the restriction that $p$ be unramified in $F$ from prior work in this direction. We also establish one direction of a conjectural relation with the algebraic analogue of the weight part of Serre's Conjecture in this context. Finally, we prove results towards our conjecture in the case of partial weight one for real quadratic fields $F$ in which $p$ is ramified.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper provides a detailed expository and computational account of the elementary methods developed by P. L. Chebyshev and J. J. Sylvester to establish explicit bounds on the prime counting function. The core of the method involves replacing the Möbius function with a finitely supported arithmetic function in the convolution identities, relating the Chebyshev function psi(x) to the summatory logarithm function T(x) = log([x]!). We present a comprehensive analysis of the various schemes proposed by Chebyshev and Sylvester, with a central focus on Sylvester's innovative iterative refinement procedure. By implementing this procedure computationally, we replicate, verify, and optimize the historical results, providing a self-contained pedagogical resource for this pivotal technique in analytic number theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>While Kronecker coefficients $g(λ,μ,ν)$ with bounded rows are polynomial-time computable via lattice-point methods, no explicit closed-form formulas have been obtained for genuinely three-row cases in the 87 years since Murnaghan's foundational work. This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse. We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge. We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \mod 2)$ for all $n \geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.</p></details>

As an application, we derive an upper bound for the self-intersection number of relative dualizing sheaf in terms of successive minima with respect to $L^2$-norm. The result has the geometric analogue that the slopes of the Harder-Narasimhan filtration of relative dualizing sheaf provide an upper bound for self-intersection number. Suppose that the arithmetic surface admits a section and has generic fiber of genus at least two, we obtain a refined upper bound for the self-intersection number, which is governed by the topological and arithmetic information of the section.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The infinity symmetric power $L$-functions play a fundamental role in Wan's groundbreaking work on Dwork's conjecture[16]. Building upon this foundation, Haessig[8] established the $p$-adic estimates for these $L$-functions in the case of the one-dimensional Kloosterman family. In this paper, we extend Haessig's results by deriving a uniform lower bound for the $q$-adic Newton polygon of the infinite symmetric power $L$-functions associated with the hyper-Kloosterman family. For the $1$-dimensional Kloosterman family, Haessig[8] showed that there is a $p$-adic cohomology theory for the infinity symmetric power $L$-function. In this paper, we prove there is also a cohomological description of the infinity symmetric power $L$-function for the hyper-Kloosterman family. By applying the Frobenius endomorphism to this cohomology, we derive a uniform lower bound for the corresponding $L$-function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Rosenfeld postulated ``generalized'' projective planes, which exploit a correspondence between rank-one idempotents of Jordan algebras $\mathfrak{J}_3(\mathbb{A})$ and points of projective planes $\mathbb{A}P^2$. The isometry groups of the generalized projective planes (which were later defined rigorously as homogeneous spaces) are entries of the Tits-Freudenthal magic square. Given recent interest in the Dixon algebra $\mathbb{R}\otimes\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}\otimes\mathbb{O}$, we extend Rosenfeld's approach and present three new coset manifolds. These "Dixon-Rosenfeld planes" have isometry algebras that are obtained from Tits' magic formula and involve all tensorial components of the Dixon algebra. We show that these are the only three planes obtainable with Tits' formula that preserve the analogy with Rosenfeld's planes. These non-simple Lie algebras generalize $\mathfrak{f}_{4},\mathfrak{e}_{6},\mathfrak{e}_{7}$ and $\mathfrak{e}_{8}$ for the octonionic plane $\mathbb{O}P^{2}$ and in the octonionic Rosenfeld planes $\left(\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{O}\right)P^{2}$, $\left(\mathbb{H}\otimes\mathbb{O}\right)P^{2}$ and $\left(\mathbb{O}\otimes\mathbb{O}\right)P^{2}$. We finally investigate the relationships between the isometry algebras of the Dixon-Rosenfeld planes and the exceptional Lie algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For certain groups, parabolic subgroups appear as stabilizers of flags of sets or vector spaces. Quotients by these parabolic subgroups represent orbits of flags, and their cardinalities asymptotically reveal entropies (as rates of exponential or superexponential growth). The multiplicative "chain rules" that involve these cardinalities induce, asymptotically, additive analogues for entropies. Many traditional formulas in information theory correspond to quotients of symmetric groups, which are a particular kind of reflection group; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by multinomial coefficients and are asymptotically related to Shannon entropy. One can treat similarly quotients of the general linear groups over a finite field; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by $q$-multinomials and are asymptotically related to the Tsallis 2-entropy. In this contribution, we consider other finite reflection groups as well as the symplectic group as an example of a classical group over a finite field (groups of Lie type). In both cases, the groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams into infinite series of similar groups $A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$ and a finite number of exceptional ones. The $A_n$ series consists of the symmetric groups (reflection case) and general linear groups (Lie case). Some of the other series, studied here from an information-theoretic perspective for the first time, are linked to new entropic functionals.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{M}_n$ be the multiplicative monoid of $n \times n$ matrices over a finite field. The monoid algebra $\mathbf{C}[\mathfrak{M}_n]$ has been studied for several decades. One of the important early results is Kovács' theorem that the two-sided ideal spanned by matrices of rank at most $r$ has a unit. Our most significant result is an explicit formula for this unit. Prior to our work, such a formula was only known in a few examples. We also study the module theory of $\mathbf{C}[\mathfrak{M}_n]$. We explicitly describe the simple modules, and establish induction and restriction rules. We show that the simple decomposition of an arbitrary module can be determined using character theory of finite general linear groups; this relies on a Pieri rule of Gurevich--Howe. We also establish a version of Schur--Weyl duality for $\mathbf{C}[\mathfrak{M}_n]$. Many of these results hold over more general coefficient fields.</p></details>

In the most interesting cases, the dominance region is a line segment, which we describe explicitly. Motivations for this work include a project to determine all pointed bases for cluster algebras of affine type and a separate project to determine all theta functions in the affine case. The proofs draw on known results from the doubled Cambrian fan and almost-positive roots models, as well as a new tool that we develop: a detailed description of neighboring seeds of affine type (seeds that are, in some sense, as close as possible to the boundary of the g-vector fan).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study whether a Large Language Model can learn the deterministic sequence of trees generated by the iterated prime factorization of the natural numbers. Each integer is mapped into a rooted planar tree and the resulting sequence $ \mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$ defines an arithmetic text with measurable statistical structure. A transformer network (the GPT-2 architecture) is trained from scratch on the first $10^{11}$ elements to subsequently test its predictive ability under next-word and masked-word prediction tasks. Our results show that the model partially learns the internal grammar of $\mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$, capturing non-trivial regularities and correlations. This suggests that learnability may extend beyond empirical data to the very structure of arithmetic.</p></details>

These turn out to be indexed by integer partitions arising as topological completions of specific direct limits of Hecke-Specht modules. We give detailed analysis of these representations and construct functionals analogous to finite Hecke algebra traces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a novel $n(n+1)/2$-dimensional non-semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_n$, a generalisation of both $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{K})$ and the two-photon Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}_6$. We investigate its properties, including its structure, representations, and its Casimir elements. In particular, we prove that there exists only one non-trivial Casimir polynomial of degree $n$ given by the determinant of an $n\times n$ symmetric matrix. We then associate this Lie algebra to a hierarchy of Hamiltonian systems with integrability properties depending on $n$, and describe their first integrals as sums of squares of linear combinations of the components of the angular momentum. In particular, we obtain that these systems are integrable for $n=2$, quasi-integrable for $n=3$, and of Poincaré-Lyapunov-Nekhoroshev type for $n\geq4$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 24 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study Dirichlet $L$-functions via discrete analogs $L_n$ arising from the spectral theory of cyclic graphs as $n\rightarrow \infty$. Using a refined Euler-Maclaurin asymptotic expansion due to Sidi, together with an independent polynomiality property of these finite spectral sums at integers, we obtain exact special-value formulas, even starting at $n=1$. This yields new expressions for certain trigonometric sums of interest in physics, and recovers, by a different method, the striking formulas of Xie, Zhao, and Zhao. It also gives infinite families of recursion relations among special values of the Riemann zeta function and of Dirichlet $L$-functions. Concerning zeros, we prove that, for odd primitive characters, a natural asymptotic functional equation for the discrete functions $L_n$ is equivalent to the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for the corresponding Dirichlet $L$-function. We also provide some remarks about the non-existence of possible real zeros.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 60 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider several old problems involving the number of prime divisors function $ω(n)$, as well as the related functions $Ω(n)$ and $τ(n)$. Firstly, we show that there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $ω(n+k) \leq Ω(n+k) \ll k$ for all positive integers $k$, establishing a conjecture of Erdős and Straus. Secondly, we show that the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} ω(n)/2^n$ is irrational, settling a conjecture of Erdős. Thirdly, we prove an asymptotic formula conjectured by Erdős, Pomerance and Sárközy for the number of $n\leq x$ satisfying $ω(n)=ω(n+1)$, for almost all $x$, with similar results for $Ω$ and $τ$. Common to the resolution of all these problems is the use of the probabilistic method. For the first problem, this is combined with computations involving a high-dimensional sieve of Maynard-type. For the second and third problems, we instead make use of a general quantitative estimate for two-point correlations of multiplicative functions with a small power of logarithm saving that may be of independent interest. This correlation estimate is derived by using recent work of Pilatte.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $ρ: Γ\to G$ be an Anosov representation, with $Γ$ a word hyperbolic group and $G$ a semisimple Lie group. Previous works (Guichard--Wienhard, Kapovich--Leeb--Porti, and Carvajales--Stecker) constructed an open domain of discontinuity $Ω_ρ\subset G/H$, where $H$ is a parabolic or symmetric subgroup. In this paper, we extend the properly discontinuous $Γ$-action via $ρ$ to the space of connections on the pullbacks of the tangent bundle over $Ω_ρ$. When $Ω_ρ$ is a complex curve, we show that the $Γ$-action is properly discontinuous on the union of Higgs bundle structures associated with the $(1,0)$ part of the complexified pullback bundles. We further construct a free abelian group $F^{ab}$ generated by these holomorphic line bundles and induce a topoogical structure on it, so that $ρ(Γ)$ acts properly discontinuously on $F^{ab} \setminus \{\mathrm{id}\}$. This free abelian group is well-defined up to isomorphism over the character variety of Zariski dense Anosov representations. Finally, we endow the space of Anosov representations with a categorical structure compatible with $Ω_ρ$ and construct a natural functor to the category of abelian groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study the (co)homology of Tanabe algebras, which are a family of subalgebras of the partition algebras exhibiting a Schur-Weyl duality with certain complex reflection groups. The homology of the partition algebras has been shown to be related to the homology of the symmetric groups by Boyd-Hepworth-Patzt and the results they obtain depend on a parameter. In all known results, the homology of a diagram algebra is dependent on one of two things: the invertibility of a parameter in the ground ring or the parity of the positive integer indexing the number of pairs of vertices. We show that the (co)homology of Tanabe algebras is isomorphic to the (co)homology of the symmetric groups and that this is independent of both the parameter and the parity of the index. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a result of this sort. Along the way we will also study the (co)homology of the uniform block permutation algebra and the totally propagating partition algebra as well collecting cohomological analogues of known results for the homology of partition algebras and Jones annular algebras.</p></details>

Also, we construct closed forms that count all Mersenne primes between $0$ and $2^{n+2}-1$, respectively all Fermat primes between $0$ and $6n+5$ and all twin-prime pairs between $0$ and $n$. Every closed form is an arithmetic term, i. e. a fixed finite composition of the following arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division with remainder and the exponentiation $2^n$. While for generating these sets with repetitions, only Wilson's Theorem is applied, for the counting forms we use more specific tests, i.e. Lucas-Lehmer, respectively Pepin, and we apply to some extent Jones' work (see Acta Arithmetica XXXV, pg. 210 - 221, 1979). To count twin primes we apply Clement's Theorem, which is closely related to Wilson's. A closed form to count the Sophie Germain primes can be constructed similarly.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For almost a century, the decidability of the Skolem Problem - that is, the problem of finding whether a given linear recurrence sequence (LRS) has a zero term - has remained open. A breakthrough in the 1980s established that the Skolem Problem is indeed decidable for algebraic LRS of order at most 3, and real algebraic LRS of order at most 4. However, for general algebraic LRS of order 4 the question of decidability has remained open. Our main contribution in this paper is to prove decidability for this last case, i.e. we show that the Skolem Problem is decidable for all algebraic LRS of order at most 4.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 155 pages,

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present the first algorithm for computing class groups and unit groups of arbitrary number fields that provably runs in probabilistic subexponential time, assuming the Extended Riemann Hypothesis (ERH). Previous subexponential algorithms were either restricted to imaginary quadratic fields, or relied on several heuristic assumptions that have long resisted rigorous analysis. The heart of our method is a new general strategy to provably solve a recurring computational problem in number theory (assuming ERH): given an ideal class $[\mathfrak{a}]$ of a number field $K$, sample an ideal $\mathfrak b \in [\mathfrak{a}]$ belonging to a particular family of ideals (e.g., the family of smooth ideals, or near-prime ideals). More precisely, let $\mathcal{S}$ be an arbitrary family of ideals, and $\mathcal{S}_B$ the family of $B$-smooth ideals. We describe an efficient algorithm that samples ideals $\mathfrak b \in [\mathfrak{a}]$ such that $\mathfrak b \in \mathcal{S} \cdot\mathcal{S}_B$ with probability proportional to the density of $\mathcal{S}$ within the set of all ideals. The case where $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of prime ideals yields the family $\mathcal{S}\cdot\mathcal{S}_B$ of near-prime ideals, of particular interest in that it constitutes a dense family of efficiently factorable ideals. The case of smooth ideals $\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{S}_B$ regularly comes up in index-calculus algorithms (notably to compute class groups and unit groups), where it has long constituted a theoretical obstacle overcome only by heuristic arguments.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study modules over a generalized Weyl algebra $R(σ,a)$ which are free when restricted to the base ring $R$. When $R$ is an integral domain, we construct all such finite-rank modules up to isomorphism, leading to new simple modules over a variety of algebras. In particular, we show that free modules that have rank $1$ over $R$ can be parametrized as $V_{\mathsf{p}}$ where $\mathsf{p}$ is a divisor of $a$. We give simplicity criteria for $V_{\mathsf{p}}$ and, additionally, when $R$ is a PID, provide a complete combinatorial description of the submodule structure of $V_{\mathsf{p}}$ and of the weight modules occurring as subquotients. We also show that, under some mild conditions on $R(σ,a)$, there exist simple $R$-free modules of arbitrary finite rank. We apply our results to $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ in order to construct new families of simple Cartan-free modules of all finite ranks.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Chevalley group schemes are group schemes defined over the integers that parametrize connected reductive groups over algebraically closed fields as geometric fibers. In this paper, we construct closed subgroup schemes of Chevalley group schemes that parametrize symmetric subgroups of reductive groups as geometric fibers. Our construction relies crucially on the theory of quantum symmetric pairs and thus naturally admits a quantization. At the quantum level, this leads to the construction of coisotropic quantum right subgroups of the quantized function algebras of reductive groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For primes $p$ and $\ell$ such that $\ell$ divides $p-1$, Hirano and Morishita constructed a nonabelian Galois extension of the function field $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$ whose degree is $\ell^3$ and Galois group is of Heisenberg type. Here we analyze how primes of degree one decompose in such extensions. It amounts to investigating the decomposition of the principal ideal $(t-a)$ for $a \in \mathbb{F}_p-\{0,1\}$ and our main result determines when it decomposes completely in terms of an explicit polynomial in $a$. It is reminiscent of Euler's criterion. The proof relies on both the group structure of the mod-$\ell$ Heisenberg group and the arithmetic of field extensions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a uniform construction of "mixed versions" or "graded lifts" in the sense of Beilinson-Ginzburg-Soergel which works for arbitrary Artin stacks. In particular, we obtain a general construction of graded lifts of many categories arising in geometric representation theory and categorified knot invariants. Our new theory associates to each Artin stack of finite type $\mathcal{Y}$ over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q$ a symmetric monoidal DG-category $\mathsf{Shv}_{\mathsf{gr}, c}(\mathcal{Y})$ of constructible graded sheaves on $\mathcal{Y}$ along with the six-functor formalism, a perverse $t$-structure, and a weight (or co-$t$-)structure in the sense of Bondarko and Pauksztello, compatible with the six-functor formalism, perverse $t$-structures, and Frobenius weights on the category of (mixed) $\ell$-adic sheaves. Classically, mixed versions were only constructed in very special cases due to the non-semisimplicity of Frobenius. Our construction sidesteps this issue by semi-simplifying the Frobenius action itself. However, the category $\mathsf{Shv}_{\mathsf{gr}, c}(\mathcal{Y})$ agrees with those previously constructed when they are available. For example, for any reductive group $G$ with a fixed pair $T\subset B$ of a maximal torus and a Borel subgroup, we have an equivalence of monoidal DG weight categories $\mathsf{Shv}_{\mathsf{gr}, c}(B\backslash G/B) \simeq \mathsf{Ch}^b(\mathsf{SBim}_W)$, where $\mathsf{Ch}^b(\mathsf{SBim}_W)$ is the monoidal $\mathsf{DG}$-category of bounded chain complexes of Soergel bimodules and $W$ is the Weyl group of $G$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The theory of normality for base $g$ expansions of real numbers in $[0,1)$ is rich and well developed. Similar theories have been developed for many other numeration systems, such as the regular continued fraction expansion, $β$-expansions, and Lüroth series expansions. Let $Q=(q_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of integers greater than or equal to 2. The $Q$-Cantor series expansion of $x \in [0,1)$ is the unique sum of the form $x=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x_n}{q_1q_2\cdots q_n}$, where $x_n \neq q_n-1$ infinitely often. For the Cantor series expansions, most of the literature thus far considers $Q$ where the theory of normality differs drastically from that of the base $g$ expansions. We introduce the class of dynamically generated Cantor series expansions, which is a large class of Cantor series expansions for which much of the classical theory of base $g$ expansions can be developed in parallel. This class includes many examples such as the Thue-Morse sequence on $\{2,3\}$ and translated Champernowne numbers. A special case of our main results is that if $Q$ is a bounded basic sequence that is dynamically generated by an ergodic system having zero entropy, then normality base $Q$ coincides with distribution normality base $Q$, and $Q$ possesses a Hot Spot Theorem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We answer several questions of Erdős regarding sequences of natural numbers $A$ whose translates $n+A$ intersect with the squarefree numbers in various specified ways. For instance, we show that if every translate only contains finitely many squarefree numbers, then $A$ has zero density, although the decay rate of this density can be arbitrarily slow. On the other hand, there exist sequences $A$ with optimal density $6/π^2$ for which infinitely many $n$ exist such that $n+a$ is squarefree for all $a \in A$ with $a < n$. In fact, infinitely many such $n$ exist for every exponentially increasing sequence, as long as the sequence avoids at least one residue class modulo $p^2$ for all primes $p$, a property we call admissible. If one instead requires infinitely many $n$ to exist such that $n+a$ is squarefree for all $a \in A$, then $A$ can have density arbitrarily close to, but not equal to, $6/π^2$. Finally, we prove bounds on the growth rate of sequences $A$ for which $a+a'$ is squarefree for all $a,a' \in A$, as well as bounds on the largest admissible subset of $\{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We completely classify Laurent series converging on the unit circle over a non-Archimedean local field (of any characteristic) that map infinitely many roots of unity to roots of unity. For a given Laurent series $f$ over a field of positive characteristic with residue field $\mathbb{F}_q$, we prove effective bounds for the number of possible roots of unity in terms of the number of zeroes of the auxilliary function $f(x^q) -f(x)^q$. In characteristic $0$ our bound is still effective but also depends on the ramification degree of the base field over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ as well as the size of the coefficients of $f$. This has applications to the Manin-Mumford conjecture in $\mathbb{G}_m^2$. In characteristic $0$, this work builds upon a pigeon-hole based method by Schmidt.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A field $K$ is $d$-local if there exist fields $K=k_d,...,k_0$ with $k_{i+1}$ complete discrete valuation with residue field $k_i$, and $k_0$ finite of characteristic $p$. By work of Deninger and Wingberg, the Galois cohomology of such fields with finite coefficients satisfies a duality generalizing Tate duality when either $d=0$, $\mathrm{char} k_1=0$ or the coefficients have no $p$-torsion. Reviewing and synthesizing results of Suzuki and Kato, we obtain $p$-torsion duality statements under the weaker assumption that either $d\leq 1$ or $\mathrm{char} k_2=0$, as well as for varieties over $K$, where duality is stated in terms of locally compact Hausdorff topologies on the étale cohomology groups. More generally we obtain results for any perfect $k_0$, endowing the totally unramified cohomology groups of $K$ with the structure of ind-pro-quasi-algebraic $k_0$-groups.</p></details>

Furthermore, a necessary and sufficient condition, in terms of class groups of $p$-extensions, for the vanishing of 3-fold Massey products is given.

In this paper, we achieve multiple goals: (\textbf{A}) establish the implication $\mathrm{MT}_p\Leftrightarrow \mathrm{logAL}_p \Rightarrow \mathrm{geoAO_p}$, and show that they all follow from the Tate conjecture for abelian varieties. The equivalence $\mathrm{MT}_p\Leftrightarrow \mathrm{logAL}_p$ is exploited from both sides, which enables us to \noindent(\textbf{B}) develop a representation theory approach to $\mathrm{logAL}_p$ and $\mathrm{geoAO_p}$ by first establishing many cases of MT$_p$ via classical techniques, and (\textbf{C}) develop an algebraization approach to $\MTT_p$ that transcends the limitation of classical methods. In particular, we introduce ``crystalline Hodge loci'', a rigid analytic geometric object that encodes the essential information needed for proving $\mathrm{logAL}_p$, while being very approachable via (integral and relative) $p$-adic Hodge theory. This enables us to prove $\mathrm{logAL}_p$ for compact Tate-linear curves with unramified $p$-adic monodromy.

Along the way, we solve Chai's Tate-linear conjecture for products of GSpin Shimura varieties, and reveal an intimate relation among the four conjectures mentioned above. Our proof uses Crew's parabolicity conjecture which is recently proven by D'Addezio.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the 1970s, Serre proved that the adelic index of a non-CM elliptic curve over a number field is finite. More recently, Zywina conjectured the complete set of adelic indices for such curves over $\mathbb{Q}$. In this article, we prove that Zywina's conjecture is true for the family of non-CM elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ that admit a nontrivial rational cyclic isogeny. This strengthens a result of Lemos that resolved Serre's uniformity question for the same family of curves. Our proof proceeds by analyzing a collection of modular curves associated with each prime isogeny degree, using recent advances on $\ell$-adic images, isogeny-torsion graphs, and computations of models and rational points.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the modular resolution method using new tools called polynumbers and polyseries, introduced by Prof. Wildberger N.J. We try to prove an equivalence theorem of the existence and the uniqueness of the solutions of the modular quadratic equations, using the recurrence formula between the Catalan sequence terms and introducing the following notions: Wildberger's polynumber sequences (polynomials), binomial Chu-Vandermonde identity and truncated polyseries.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a CM field. In this paper, we prove the local-global compatibility for cohomological cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{A}_F)$ at $p \neq l$ by using certain potential automorphy theorems in some cases including higher dimensional cases. Moreover, we also prove the Ramanujan conjecture for cohomological cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{A}_F )$.</p></details>
