### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16978v2'>2501.16978</a>\]&nbsp; **$\otimes$-Frobenius functors and exact module categories**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** David Jaklitsch, Harshit Yadav &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** v2: 48 pages. Streamlined parts of the text; introduced the notion of a tensor functor being Frobenius with respect to a module category (Sec. 4), including examples from Hopf algebras (Sec. 5); corrected an error in Lemma 4.10 from the previous version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We call a tensor functor $F:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{D}$ between finite tensor categories $\otimes$-Frobenius if the left and right adjoints of $F$ are isomorphic as $\mathcal{C}$-bimodule functors. We provide various characterizations of $\otimes$-Frobenius functors such as the unimodularity of the centralizer $\mathcal{Z}({}_F\mathcal{D}_F)$. We analyze the procedure of pulling back actions of tensor categories on module categories along tensor functors, and show that properties like pivotality and unimodularity are preserved if $F$ if $\otimes$-Frobenius. These results allow the transport of Frobenius algebras under certain conditions. We apply the results to internal natural transformations and examples coming from Hopf algebras.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Alexander Hazeltine, Dihua Jiang, Baiying Liu, Chi-Heng Lo, Qing Zhang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a new conjecture (Conjecture 1.1) on the structure of the unitary dual by means of the Arthur representations for general reductive algebraic groups defined over any non-Archimedean local field of characteristic zero. We also propose a conjecture (Conjecture 1.2) refining Conjecture 1.1 for representations of good parity. The relations among the two conjectures and special families of representations are explained in Figure 1. The main results include a partial approval of Conjecture 1.1 (Theorem 1.5); an algorithm to determine a candidate of the unitary dual (Algorithm 8.5); and the verification of Conjectures 1.1 and 1.2 for many known unitary duals, especially for representations of corank at most 3 for symplectic or split odd special orthogonal groups, based on Tadi{\'c}'s classification (Theorem 1.6), and G_2. To prove the main results, we develop new algorithms to determine whether a given irreducible representation is of Arthur type and give an inductive approach to classify the family of unitary representations that are of Arthur type for classical groups. We explicate this approach towards the unitary dual problem for representations of corank 3 and several new families of representations.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Davide De Leo, Michael Stoll &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Removed Conjecture 1.1; added Remark 1.1. Corrected some typos and improved clarity

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let \( p \geq 5 \) be a prime. In 2003 Conrad, Edixhoven, and Stein conjectured that the rational torsion subgroup of the modular Jacobian \( J_1(p) \) coincides with the rational cuspidal divisor class group. Using explicit computations in Magma, the open case \( p = 29 \) has been proven by Derickx, Kamienny, Stein, and Stoll in 2023. We extend these results to primes \( p = 97, 101, 109, \) and \( 113 \). In addition, we provide a list of the groups \( J_1(p)(\mathbb{Q})_{\text{tors}} \) for every prime up to \( p \leq 113 \). However, our method is general and can be applied to larger primes.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Isabela Recio &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 29 pages. Coloured figures. Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present two applications of the concept of higher idempotent completion to higher categories relevant in link homology theory and higher representation theory. We show that singular Soergel bimodules can be recovered from Soergel bimodules through partial 2-categorical idempotent completions. Specializing to type A, we further assemble singular Soergel bimodules into a semistrict monoidal 2-category and identify certain quotients as semistrict monoidal 2-categories of gl_N foams. Our second main result uses 2-categorical idempotent completions to formulate a higher categorical branching rule for such foam theories, which underlie the Lee-Gornik-Rasmussen-Wu deformations of coloured gl_N link homology. In particular, we provide a fully local version of Rose-Wedrich's decomposition theorem on deformed coloured link homology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The *somewhere-to-below shuffles* are the elements $$ t_{\ell} := \mathrm{cyc}_{\ell}+\mathrm{cyc}_{\ell,\ell+1}+\mathrm{cyc}_{\ell,\ell+1,\ell+2}+\cdots+\mathrm{cyc}_{\ell,\ell+1,\ldots,n} $$ (for $\ell \in \{1,2,\dots,n\}$) in the group algebra $\mathbf{k}[S_n]$ of the $n$-th symmetric group $S_n$. Their linear combinations are called the *one-sided cycle shuffles*. We determine the eigenvalues of the action of any one-sided cycle shuffle on any Specht module $\mathcal{S}^{\lambda}$ of $S_n$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 35 pages, 14 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we examine the groups $G_2$ and $G_3$ associated to the $2 \times 2$ and $3 \times 3$ Rubik's cubes. We express $G_2$ and $G_3$ in terms of familiar groups and exhibit a split homomorphism $\psi: G_3 \longrightarrow G_2$ to prove that $G_2$ embeds inside $G_3$ as a subgroup. In addition, we prove several results bounding the dimensions of minimal faithful representations of finite abelian groups split by some complementary subgroup. We then employ these results to determine the minimal faithful dimensions of $G_2$ and $G_3$ over both $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{R}$. We find that $G_2$ has minimal dimension 8 over $\mathbb{C}$ and 16 over $\mathbb{R}$, and that $G_3$ has minimal dimension 20 over $\mathbb{C}$ and 28 over $\mathbb{R}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 6 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use recently developed algorithms and a new database of modular curves constructed for the L-functions and Modular Forms Database to enumerate completely decomposable modular Jacobians of level N < 240. In particular, we find examples in 13 previously unknown genera of Jacobian varieties isogenous to a product of elliptic curves over Q. The new genera are: 38, 68, 75, 76, 77, 78, 113, 135, 137, 157, 159, 169, and 409.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 9 pages, 5 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A scalar integer partition problem asks for a number of nonnegative integer solutions to a linear Diophantine equation with integer positive coefficients. The manuscript discusses an algorithm of derivation of linear relations involving the finite number of scalar partitions. The algorithm employs the Cayley theorem about the reduction of a double partition to a sum of scalar partitions based on the variable elimination procedure.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 47 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A problem raised by Cuadra and Simson in 2007 asks whether a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category with enough flat objects has enough projective objects. We prove that the categories involved in the statement are precisely the locally finitely presented Grothendieck categories with exact product functors. This enables reformulations of the problem that answer the latter in the negative and prove that it is related to a classical problem posed by Miller in 1975 and to the Telescope Conjecture for compactly generated triangulated categories. Our partial affirmative answers imply that any locally finitely presented Grothendieck category whose subcategory of finitely presented objects is Krull--Schmidt has enough flat objects if, and only if, it has a set of finitely generated projective generators.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 13 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a topological characterization of quivers whose path algebra satisfies a polynomial identity. This class includes the oriented cycle and acyclic quivers and, in the latter case, we describe the associated T-ideal. We introduce a generalization of Arnold's A-graded algebras, which we call locally A-graded algebras, and prove that they are also PI. We give an example of a quiver algebra satisfying a polynomial identity, even if the path algebra of the quiver does not.</p></details>

> **Comment:** The new version shows that the conjectural leading constant is well-defined and fixes some typos

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We formulate a conjecture on the number of integral points of bounded height on log Fano varieties in analogy with Manin's conjecture on the number of rational points of bounded height on Fano varieties. We also give a prediction for the leading constant which is similar to Peyre's interpretation of the leading constant in Manin's conjecture. We give evidence for our conjecture by proving it for toric varieties. The proof is based on harmonic analysis on universal torsors.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Arithmetic properties of some families in $\frac{\mathbb{F}_l[x]}{\langle x^{p^sq^t}-1\rangle}$ are obtained by using the cyclotomic classes of order 2 with respect to $n=p^sq^t$, where $p\equiv3 \mathrm{mod} 4$, $\gcd(\phi(p^s),\phi(q^t))=2$, $l$ is a primitive root modulo $q^t$ and $\mathrm{ord}_{p^s}(l)=\phi(p^s)/2$. The form of these cyclotomic classes enables us to further generalize the results obtained in \cite{ref1}. The explicit expressions of primitive idempotents of minimal ideals in $\frac{\mathbb{F}_l[x]}{\langle x^{p^sq^t}-1\rangle}$ are also obtained.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Pavel Guerzhoy &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Several authors have recently proved results which express a cusp form as a $p$-adic limit of weakly holomorphic modular forms under repeated application of Atkin's $U$-operator. Initially, these results had a deficiency: one could not rule out the possibility when a certain quantity vanishes and the final result fails to be true. Later on, Ahlgren and Samart \cite{AS} found a method to prove that no exceptions happen in the specific case considered by El-Guindy and Ono, Hanson and Jameson, and (independently) Dicks. generalized this method to finitely many other cases. In this paper, we present a different approach which allows us to prove a similar non-vanishing result for an infinite family of similar cases. Our approach also allows us to return back to the original example considered by El-Guindy and Ono, where we calculate the (manifestly non-zero) quantity explicitly in terms of Morita's $p$-adic $\Gamma$-function.</p></details>

We propose some conjectures concerning the simple quotients of $M\otimes N$, where $M,N$ are objects in the representation category $\mathscr{X}({\bf G})$. We provide several pieces of evidence for these conjectures. In particular, we show that these conjectures are valid for ${\bf G}=SL_2(\bar{\mathbb{F}}_q)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages, results significantly expanded

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study admissible subcategories of the derived categories of smooth noncommutative (nc) curves as classified by Reiten-van den Bergh. We prove that any admissible subcategory of the derived category of a smooth nc curve is again the derived category of a smooth nc curve. We use this result to classify semiorthogonal decompositions in derived categories of nc curves. The results obtained imply that phantom categories do not exist in these cases. As a further application, we prove an extension of the Bondal-Orlov reconstruction theorem to the case of orbifold curves.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 31 pages, comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of almost unital and finite-dimensional (AUF) algebras, which are associative $\mathbb C$-algebras that may be non-unital or infinite-dimensional, but have sufficiently many idempotents. We show that the pseudotrace construction, originally introduced by Hattori and Stallings for unital finite-dimensional algebras, can be generalized to AUF algebras. Let $A$ be an AUF algebra. Suppose that $G$ is a projective generator in the category $\mathrm{Coh}_{\mathrm{L}}(A)$ of finitely generated left $A$-modules that are quotients of free left $A$-modules, and let $B = \mathrm{End}_{A,-}(G)^{\mathrm{opp}}$. We prove that the pseudotrace construction yields an isomorphism between the spaces of symmetric linear functionals $\mathrm{SLF}(A)\xrightarrow{\simeq} \mathrm{SLF}(B)$, and that the non-degeneracies on the two sides are equivalent.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using the WZ method to prove supercongruences critically depends on an inspired WZ pair choice. This paper demonstrates a procedure for finding WZ pair candidates to prove a given supercongruence. When suitable WZ pairs are thus obtained, coupling them with the $p$-adic approximation of $\Gamma_p$ by Long and Ramakrishna enables uniform proofs for the Van Hamme supercongruences B.2, C.2, D.2, E.2, F.2, G.2, and H.2. This approach also yields the known extensions of G.2 modulo $p^4$, and of H.2 modulo $p^3$ when $p$ is $3$ modulo $4$. Finally, the Van Hamme supercongruence I.2 is shown to be a special case of the WZ method where Gosper's algorithm itself succeeds.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages. v3: comments from the referee. To appear in Math Z

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Inspired by the papers by Angelo and Xu, Q.J Math., 74, pp. 767-777, and improvements by Kerr and Klurman, arXiv:2211.05540, we study the probability that the weighted sums of a Rademacher random multiplicative function, $\sum_{n\leq x}f(n)n^{-\sigma}$, are positive for all $x\geq x_\sigma\geq 1$ in the regime $\sigma\to1/2^+$. In a previous paper by Heap, Zhao and the author, and by the author, when $0\leq \sigma\leq 1/2$ this probability is zero. Here we give a positive lower bound for this probability depending on $x_\sigma$ that becomes large as $\sigma\to1/2^+$. The main inputs in our proofs are a maximal inequality based in relatively high moments for these partial sums combined with a Bonami--Hal\'asz's moment inequality, and also explicit estimates for the partial sums of non-negative multiplicative functions.</p></details>

Let $E$ be an algebraically closed countable field extension of the residue field of $F$. In this short note, we explain how the methods from arXiv:1809.10247 and arXiv:2210.07281 can be used to construct irreducible smooth representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$ over $E$ without a central character. We also construct irreducible smooth representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$ over $E$ with simultaneously a central character, nonscalar endomorphisms, and if $n>3$, without a Hecke eigenvalue.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a field of characteristic not 2 or 3. We establish polynomial lower bounds on the ambient dimension $N$ for an intersection $X\subset\mathbb{P}^N$ of quadrics, cubics and quartics to have a dense collection of solvable points, i.e. points in $X(k^{\mathsf{Sol}})$ where $k^{\mathsf{Sol}}/k$ is a solvable closure. Our method connects the classical theory of polar hypersurfaces, as redeveloped by Sutherland, to Fano varieties $\mathcal{F}(j,X)$ of $j$-dimensional linear subspaces on $X$, and we use this to obtain improved control on the arithmetic of $\mathcal{F}(j,X)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The celebrated L\'evy--Khintchine theorem is a fundamental limiting law that describes the growth rate of the denominators of the convergents in the continued fraction expansion of a Lebesgue-typical real number. In a recent breakthrough, Cheung and Chevallier \textit{(Annales scientifiques de l'ENS, 2024)} extended this theorem to higher dimensions. In this paper, we resolve a conjecture of Y. Cheung and answer a question of Cheung and Chevallier concerning L\'evy--Khintchine type theorems for arbitrary norms. We also establish a higher-dimensional analogue of the Doeblin--Lenstra law. While our results are new in higher dimensions, they also yield significant improvements in the classical one-dimensional setting. Specifically, we revisit the L\'evy--Khintchine theorem and the Doeblin--Lenstra law through the lens of Mahler's influential proposal to study Diophantine approximation on fractals. In particular, we prove these results for almost every point on the middle-third Cantor set. More broadly, our framework applies to a wide class of measures, including those supported on curves and on self-similar fractals generated by iterated function systems (IFS), and it also allows constraints on the selection of best approximates.</p></details>

In the first part of this article we define certain \emph{Invariants} for the isomorphism classes in $\bcalNT,$ following in the same spirit of \cite{Lobos3}, where a series of \emph{Isomorphism criteria} were found.

Let $\ell$ be a prime number distinct from $p$. Let $E$ be a cyclic Galois extension of $F$ with $[E:F]=\ell$. Let $\Pi$ be a finite length $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell$-representation (or an $\ell$-modular representation) of $G(E)\rtimes {\rm Gal}(E/F)$. In this context, we prove a conjecture of Treumann and Venkatesh which predicts that the Tate cohomology groups $\widehat{H}^i({\rm Gal}(E/F), \Pi)$ are finite length representations of $G(F)$. We discuss the explicit computation of these Tate cohomology groups when $G$ is ${\rm GL}_n$ and $\Pi$ is obtained as a base change lifting of a depth-zero cuspidal representation of ${\rm GL}_n(F)$. The primary novelty from our previous work is that we treat the case where $\Pi$ is possibly non-cuspidal. We also study the ${\rm Gal}(\mathbb{F}_{q^\ell}/\mathbb{F}_q)$-Tate cohomology groups of the mod-$\ell$ reduction of the unipotent cuspidal representation of ${\rm Sp}_4(\mathbb{F}_{q^\ell})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Vertex algebras that arise from four-dimensional, $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories inherit a collection of novel structural properties from their four-dimensional ancestors. Crucially, when the parent SCFT is unitary, the corresponding vertex algebra is not unitary in the conventional sense. In this paper, we motivate and define a generalized notion of unitarity for vertex algebras that we call \emph{graded unitarity}, and which captures the consequences of four-dimensional unitarity under this correspondence. We also take the first steps towards a classification program for graded-unitary vertex algebras whose underlying vertex algebras are Virasoro or affine Kac--Moody vertex algebras. Remarkably, under certain natural assumptions about the $\mathfrak{R}$-filtration for these vertex algebras, we show that only the $(2,p)$ central charges for Virasoro VOAs and boundary admissible levels for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ Kac--Moody vertex algebras can possibly be compatible with graded unitarity. These are precisely the cases of these vertex algebras that are known to arise from four dimensions.</p></details>

We study a new set of dominant weights over Borcherds-Kac-Moody algebras, to obtain weights of any highest weight module V; and explore characters of the associated simples. Added Theorem D on characters of all V (including simples) with top weights Weyl vectors, in a negative type A setting

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix any Borcherds-Kac-Moody $\mathbb{C}$-Lie algebra (BKM LA) $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{g}(A)$ of BKM-Cartan matrix $A$, and Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}\subset \mathfrak{g}$. In this paper, we obtain explicit weight formulas of any highest weight $\mathfrak{g}$-module $V$ with top weight $\lambda\in \mathfrak{h}^*$ : 1) Generalizing and extending those in one stroke from Kac-Moody (KM) case, of simples $V=L(\lambda)$ by Khare [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 2017] and Dhillon-Khare [Adv. Math. 2017 \& J. Algebra. 2022] and recently of all $V$ by Khare-Teja; via parabolic and higher order Verma $V$. 2) Uniform for all $(\mathfrak{g}, \lambda, V)$; seemingly novel even for integrable ($L(\lambda)$ and all intermediate) $V$ for dominant integral $\lambda\in P^+$. 3) As Weyl-orbit formulas (of finite-dim. $L(\lambda)$s) for several $V$; and for our candidates of parabolic Vermas over BKM LAs. 4) Using our concepts of holes (1-dim. weight-spaces lost) in $V$, and $P^{\pm}$-dominant weights to cover Chevalley-Serre relations in generic simple $V$s. We define $P^{\pm}$ to be the set of $\mu\in \mathfrak{h}^*$ paired with simple co-roots for $A_{ii}\geq 0$ as usual, but notably by negative multiples of $\frac{|A_{ii}|}{2}$ if $A_{ii}<0$. By-products of working with $P^{\pm}$: study of simples $L(\lambda)\ \forall\ \lambda\in P^{\pm}$, notably of $L(\rho)$ for Weyl vectors $\rho\in P^{\pm} \setminus P^+$, and their Verma covers; all novel to our best knowledge. For Weyl-Kac-Borcherds character type formulas of these $L(\lambda)$s over negative rank-2 $\mathfrak{g}$ and of $L(\rho)$ over negative $A_n$ type $\mathfrak{g}$ $\forall$ $n\in \mathbb{N}$, we explore : i) their presentations; ii) their Verma modules' structures; iii) problems on maximal vectors or Verma embeddings, from Kac-Kazhdan [Adv.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper addresses the interactions between three properties that a group algebra or more generally a pointed Hopf algebra may possess: being noetherian, having finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, and satisfying the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence. First it is shown that the second and third of these properties are equivalent for group algebras $kG$ of polycyclic-by-finite groups, and are, in turn, equivalent to $G$ being nilpotent-by-finite. In characteristic 0, this enables us to extend this equivalence to certain cocommutative Hopf algebras. In the second and third parts of the paper finiteness conditions for group algebras are studied. In the second section we examine when a group algebra satisfies the Goldie conditions, while in the final section we discuss what can be said about a minimal counterexample to the conjecture that if $kG$ is noetherian then G is polycyclic-by-finite.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is a paper in smooth $4$-manifold topology, inspired by the N\'{e}ron-Lang Theorem in number theory. More precisely, we prove that a smooth version $\MW(\pi)$ of Mordell-Weil group of an elliptic fibration $\pi:M\to\Pb^1$ is finitely generated. We compute $\MW(\pi_d)$ explicitly for elliptic fibrations $\pi_d:M_d\to\Pb^1$, where $M_d$ is a simply-connected complex surfaces $M_d$ of arithmetic genus $d\geq 1$ and all fibers of $\pi_d$ are nodal. We prove in this case that the fibered structure is unique up topological isotopy. By combining this with a result of Donaldson, we obtain the following remarkable consequence: any diffeomorphism of $M_d$ with $d\geq 3$ is topologically isotopic to a diffeomorphism taking fibers to fibers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of radical preservation and prove that a radical-preserving homomorphism of left artinian rings of finite projective dimension with superfluous kernel reflects the finiteness of the little finitistic, big finitistic and global dimension. As an application, we prove that every bound quiver algebra with quasi-uniform Loewy length, a class of algebras introduced in this paper, has finite (big) finitistic dimension. The same result holds more generally in the context of semiprimary rings. Moreover, we construct an explicit family of such finite dimensional algebras where the finiteness of their big finitistic dimension does not follow from existing results in the literature.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F_h(n)$ denote the minimum cardinality of an additive {\em $h$-fold basis} of $\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$: a set $S$ such that any integer in $\{1,2,\cdots, n\}$ can be written as a sum of at most $h$ elements from $S$. While the trivial bounds $h!n \; \lesssim \; F_h(n)^h \; \lesssim \; h^h n$ are well-known, comparatively little has been established for $h>2$. In this paper, we make significant improvements to both of the best-known bounds on $F_h(n)$ for sufficiently large $h$. For the lower bound, we use a probabilistic approach along with the Berry-Esseen Theorem to improve upon the best-known asymptotic result due to Yu. We also establish the first nontrivial asymptotic upper bound on $F_h(n)$ by leveraging a construction for additive bases of finite cyclic groups due to Jia and Shen. In particular, we show that given any $\epsilon>0$, for sufficiently large $h$, we have $$ \left(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon\right)h!\sqrt{2\pi e} n\; \leq \; F_h(n)^h \; \leq \; \left(\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+\epsilon\right)h\right)^h n. $$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a non Archimedean local field, and $G$ be the $F$-points of a connected quasi-split reductive group defined over $F$. In this note we propose a converse theorem statement for generic Langlands parameters of $G$ when the Langlands dual group of $G$ is acceptable. We then prove it when $G$ is $F$-split. We also prove that the statement does not apply to $\mathrm{SO}_{2n}(F)$ for certain choices of $F$, as soon as $n\geq 3$.Then we consider a variant which we prove for $G=\mathrm{G}_2(F)$ and all quasi-split classical groups. When $F$ has characteristic zero and assuming the validity of the Gross-Prasad and Rallis conjecture, this latter variant translates via the generic local Langlands correspondence of Jantzen and Liu, into the usual local converse theorems for classical groups expressed in terms of Shahidi's gamma factors.</p></details>

Kala introduced a technique of extending such results to larger fields -- e.g. from quadratic fields to fields of arbitrary even degree -- under some conditions. We present improvements to this technique by investigating the structure of subfields within composita of number fields, using basic Galois theory to translate this into a group-theoretic problem.

Rains put an orthogonal quadratic structure on $\mathrm{H}^1(\mathbb{A}_F,A[\lambda])$ and realize the Selmer group $\mathrm{Sel}_\lambda(A)$ as an intersection of two maximal isotropic subspaces of $\mathrm{H}^1(\mathbb{A}_F,A[\lambda])$. With this understanding of Selmer groups, they expect to model the Selmer groups of elliptic curves and Jacobian varieties of hyperelliptic curves as the intersections of random maximal isotropic subspaces of orthogonal spaces. We extend this phenomenon to abelian varieties with multiplication and discuss the Shafarevich-Tate groups.</p></details>

As an application, for a prime $p\geq 3$, we obtain that the twisted Fermat curves $X^p+Y^p=\delta$ over a number field containing a primitive $p$-th root of unity are ``largely" unsolvable as $\delta$ varies. We also discuss the rank growth in cyclic extensions of prime degree for CM abelian varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Suppose we partition the integers into finitely many cells. Can we always find a solution of the equation $x^2+y^2=z^2$ with $x,y,z$ on the same cell? What about more general homogeneous quadratic equations in three variables? These are basic questions in arithmetic Ramsey theory, which have recently been partially answered using ideas inspired by ergodic theory and tools such as Gowers-uniformity properties and concentration estimates of bounded multiplicative functions. The aim of this article is to provide an introduction to this exciting research area, explaining the main ideas behind the recent progress and some of the important challenges that lie ahead.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E_1$ and $E_2$ be elliptic curves over a number field $K$. In \cite{scc}, Mazur and Rubin define the concept of $n$-Selmer near-companions and conjecture that if $E_1$ and $E_2$ are $n$-Selmer near-companions over $K$, then $E_1[n]$ is $G_K$-isomorphic to $E_2[n]$. Yu proves the conjecture on $n$-Selmer near-companion curves in the case $n=2$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct finite $R$-matrices for the first fundamental representation $V$ of two-parameter quantum groups $U_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$ for classical $\mathfrak{g}$, both through the decomposition of $V\otimes V$ into irreducibles $U_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$-submodules as well as by evaluating the universal $R$-matrix. The latter is crucially based on the construction of dual PBW-type bases of $U^{\pm}_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$ consisting of the ordered products of quantum root vectors defined via $(r,s)$-bracketings and combinatorics of standard Lyndon words. We further derive explicit formulas for affine $R$-matrices, both through the Yang-Baxterization technique of [Internat. J. Modern Phys.

The latter generalizes the formulas of [Comm. Math. Phys. 102 (1986), 537-547] for one-parametric quantum affine algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the densities of the sets of abundant numbers and of covering numbers, integers $n$ for which there exists a distinct covering system where every modulus divides $n$. We establish that the set $\mathcal{C}$ of covering numbers possesses a natural density $d(\mathcal{C})$ and prove that $0.103230 < d(\mathcal{C}) < 0.103398.$ Our approach adapts methods developed by Behrend and Del\'eglise for bounding the density of abundant numbers, by introducing a function $c(n)$ that measures how close an integer $n$ is to being a covering number with the property that $c(n) \leq h(n) = \sigma(n)/n$. However, computing $d(\mathcal{C})$ to three decimal digits requires some new ideas to simplify the computations. As a byproduct of our methods, we obtain significantly improved bounds for $d(\mathcal{A})$, the density of abundant numbers, namely $0.247619608 < d(\mathcal{A}) < 0.247619658$. We also show the count of primitive covering numbers up to $x$ is $O\left( x\exp\left(\left(-\tfrac{1}{2\sqrt{\log 2}} + \epsilon\right)\sqrt{\log x} \log \log x\right)\right)$, which is substantially smaller than the corresponding bound for primitive abundant numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For logarithmic conformal field theories whose monodromy data is given by a not necessarily semisimple modular category, we solve the problem of constructing and classifying the consistent systems of correlators. The correlator construction given in this article generalizes the well-known one for rational conformal field theories given by Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert roughly twenty years ago and solves conjectures of Fuchs, Gannon, Schaumann and Schweigert. The strategy is, even in the rational special case, entirely different. The correlators are constructed using the extension procedures that can be devised by means of the modular microcosm principle. It is shown that, as in the rational case, the correlators admit a holographic description, with the main difference that the holographic principle is phrased in terms of factorization homology. The latter description is used to prove that the coefficients of the torus partition function are non-negative integers. Moreover, we show that the derived algebra of local operators associated to a consistent system of correlators carries a Batalin-Vilkovisky structure. We prove that it is equivalent to the Batalin-Vilkovisky structure on the Hochschild cohomology of the pivotal module category of boundary conditions, for the notion of pivotality due to Schaumann and Shimizu. This proves several expectations formulated by Kapustin-Rozansky and Fuchs-Schweigert for general conformal field theories.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 86 pages. Sections 1 and 2 are largely independent (and will probably become separate articles), except for the dimension of the span in Section 1 using Section 2

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the group algebra $\mathbf{k}[S_n]$ of the $n$-th symmetric group $S_n$ over a commutative ring $\mathbf{k}$. For any two subsets $A$ and $B$ of $[n]$, we define the elements $$ \nabla_{B,A}:=\sum_{\substack{w\in S_n;\\w\left( A\right) =B}} w \qquad \text{and} \qquad \widetilde{\nabla}_{B,A}:=\sum_{\substack{w\in S_n;\\w\left( A\right) \subseteq B}}w $$ of $\mathcal{A}$. We study these elements, showing in particular that their minimal polynomials factor into linear factors (with integer coefficients). We express the product $\nabla_{D,C}\nabla_{B,A}$ as a $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combination of $\nabla_{U,V}$'s. More generally, for any two set compositions (i.e., ordered set partitions) $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ of $\left\{ 1,2,\ldots,n\right\} $, we define $\nabla_{\mathbf{B},\mathbf{A}}\in\mathcal{A}$ to be the sum of all permutations $w\in S_n$ that send each block of $\mathbf{A}$ to the corresponding block of $\mathbf{B}$. This generalizes $\nabla_{B,A}$. The factorization property of minimal polynomials does not extend to the $\nabla_{\mathbf{B},\mathbf{A}}$, but we describe the ideal spanned by the $\nabla_{\mathbf{B},\mathbf{A}}$ and a further ideal complementary to it. These two ideals have a "mutually annihilative" relationship, are free as $\mathbf{k}$-modules, and appear as annihilators of tensor product $S_n$-representations; they are also closely related to Murphy's cellular bases, Specht modules, pattern-avoiding permutations and even some algebras appearing in quantum information theory.</p></details>

This Stark system construction yields a more refined interpretation of the collection of Flach's zeta elements than the "geometric Euler system" approach due to Flach, Wiles, Mazur, and Weston.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article investigates the Hodge theory of the moduli space of genus $g$ curves with $n$ marked points, establishing new connections between Schur-Weyl duality for $\mathfrak{sp}_{g}$ and higher Abel-Jacobi invariants. We develop a represe\\ ntation-theoretic framework that decomposes higher Abel-Jacobi invariants of tautological cycles in $C_{g}^{n}$ according to symplectic Lie algebra representations, leveraging the Leray filtration and motivic decompositions compatible with $\mathfrak{sp}_{2g}$-actions. Central to this work is the introduction of \textbf{higher Faber-Pandharipande cycles} $FP_n = \pi_1^{\times 2}(\Delta_{12}^n \cdot \psi_1)$ in $CH^{n+1}(C_g^2)$, a new family of tautological cycles generalizing classical constructions. We prove these cycles are non-torsion under optimal genus constraints: for families over $(n-1)$-dimensional bases, $FP_n$ is not rationally equivalent to zero when $g \geq 3n+1$. Furthermore, we determine the precise position of $FP_n$ in the Leray filtration of $C_g^2 \to M_g$, showing it lies in depth $n+1$ but no deeper, with explicit non-vanishing in $H^{n+1}(M_g, R^{n+1}f_*\mathbb{Q})$ on the $V_{(n+1,1)}$-isotypic component. This yields the first systematic link between Schur-Weyl duality and higher transcendental invariants, revealing that higher diagonals encode geometric phenomena invisible to standard tautological classes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that, up to scaling, there exist only finitely many isometry classes of Hermitian lattices over $O_E$ of signature $(1,n)$ that admit ball quotients of non-general type, where $n>12$ is even and $E=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-D})$ for prime discriminant $-D<-3$. Furthermore, we show that even-dimensional ball quotients, associated with arithmetic subgroups of $\mathrm{U}(1,n)$ defined over $E$, are always of general type if $n > 207$, or $n>12$ and $D>2557$. To establish these results, we construct a nontrivial full-level cusp form of weight $n$ on the $n$-dimensional complex ball. A key ingredient in our proof is the use of Arthur's multiplicity formula from the theory of automorphic representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that bounded type implies finite type for a constructible subcategory of the module category of a finitely generated algebra over a field, which is a variant of the first Brauer-Thrall conjecture. A full subcategory is constructible if it consists of all modules that vanish on a finitely presented functor. Our approach makes use of the Ziegler spectrum of a ring and a connection, established in this work, with the scheme of finite dimensional modules. We also discuss a variant of the second Brauer-Thrall conjecture in this setting. It is shown to be true under additional assumptions on the algebra, but wrong in general. Lastly, it is proven that exact structures and matrix reductions give rise to constructible subcategories. Based on this, a translation from matrix reductions to reductions of exact structures is provided.</p></details>

This completes a trilogy connecting the zeta functions of ramified and split quadratic orders to the classical Andrews--Gordon and Bressoud identities, respectively. We provide strong evidence for this conjecture by deriving the first explicit formulas for the finitized Coh zeta function of the simplest order in the family, and for the $t=1$ specialization of the finitized Coh zeta functions for all orders in the family. Our primary tool is a new method based on M\"obius inversion on posets.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we demonstrate that, given an orthonormal basis of holomorphic Hecke cusp forms, conditionally, quadratic forms composed of cusp forms -- each expressed as a bounded linear combination of holomorphic Hecke cusp forms -- are generally not themselves expressible as bounded linear combinations of holomorphic Hecke cusp forms when the sum of the weights exceeds some absolute constant, provided that the coefficients of the quadratic form satisfy appropriate nonvanishing and boundedness conditions. This illustrates the finiteness of the number of solutions to the linear equation of modular forms equated to a quadratic form of large weight. We also show that, conditionally, for $0 < p < 2$, the $\ell^p$-norm of such quadratic forms in holomorphic Hecke cusp forms tends to zero asymptotically with respect to expansion in this orthonormal basis of Hecke eigenforms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that every Grothendieck topology induces a hereditary torsion pair in the category of presheaves of modules on a ringed site, and obtain a homological characterization of sheaves of modules: a presheaf of modules is a sheaf of modules if and only if it is saturated with respect to torsion presheaves, or equivalently, it is right perpendicular to torsion presheaves in the sense of Geigle and Lenzing. We also study Grothendieck topologies on directed categories $\mathscr{C}$ satisfying certain finiteness condition, and show that every Grothendieck topology on $\mathscr{C}$ is a subcategory topology if and only if $\mathscr{C}$ is an artinian EI category. Consequently, in this case every sheaf category is equivalent to the presheaf category over a full subcategory of $\mathscr{C}$. Finally, we classify all Grothendieck topologies on a special type of noetherian EI categories, and extend the locally self-injective property of representations of $\mathrm{F}$ and $\mathrm{VI}$ to representations of their infinite full subcategories. Some potential applications in group representation theory are given at the end of this paper.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Multiple zeta values arise as special values of polylogarithms defined on Riemann surfaces of various genera. Building on the vast knowledge for classical and elliptic multiple zeta values, we explore a canonical extension of the formalism to Riemann surfaces of higher genera, which yields higher-genus multiple zeta values. We provide a regularization prescription for higher-genus polylogarithms, which we extend to higher-genus multiple zeta values. Our regularization uses the Schottky uniformization to trace back higher-genus endpoint regularization to known regularization at genus one. Additionally, we are commenting on relations among higher-genus multiple zeta values implied by degeneration of the underlying geometry, where we distinguish between the two types of separating and non-separating degeneration. Finally, employing functional relations for higher-genus polylogarithms in the Schottky uniformization, we explore relations among higher-genus multiple zeta values and check them against our numerical testing setup. We identify relations for higher-genus multiple zeta values beyond those implied by polylogarithm identities, thereby matching the situation for genus zero and genus one. While we find several known structures for elliptic multiple zeta values to generalize to relations for higher-genus multiple zeta values, there are further classes of relations arising from the interplay and combinatorics of different cycles.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$, and let $f_1(z),\ldots, f_m(z) \in K[[z]]$ such that, for every $1 \leq i \leq m$, $f_i(z)$ is a solution of a differential operator $\mathcal{L}_i \in E_p[d/dz]$, where $E_p$ is the field of analytic elements. Suppose that $K$ is totally ramified over $\mathbb{Q}_p$, and that for every $1 \leq i \leq m$, the operator $\mathcal{L}_i$ has a strong Frobenius structure and satisfies the maximal order multiplicity (MOM) condition at zero. Then, we show that $f_1(z),\ldots, f_m(z)$ are algebraically dependent over $E_p$ if and only if there exist integers $a_1,\ldots, a_m$, not all zero, such that $f_1(z)^{a_1} \cdots f_m(z)^{a_m}\in E_p$. The main consequence of this result is that it provides a tool to study the algebraic independence of a broad class of $G$-functions and certain $E$-functions over the field of analytic elements.</p></details>
