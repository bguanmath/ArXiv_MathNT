 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Konstanze Rietsch &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The set of infinite upper-triangular totally positive Toeplitz matrices has a classical parametrisation proved by Edrei et al and originally conjectured by Schoenberg, that involves pairs of sequences of positive real parameters. These matrices (and their parameters) are central for understanding characters of the infinite symmetric group by work of Thoma. On the other hand there is a very different parametrisation theorem that applies to the finite analogue of this set. These finite Toeplitz matrices and their parameters relate to quantum cohomology of flag varieties and mirror symmetry. In this paper we replace the positive reals by a semifield with valuation to then construct tropical analogues for both parametrisation theorems. In the finite case we tropicalise using positive generalised Puiseaux series. This builds on work of Judd and L\"udenbach. In the infinite case we use a new valued semifield of continuous functions. We arrive at different natural infinite analogues of totally positive Toeplitz matrices, depending on a choice of topology on our valued semifield. We then prove an asymptotic result relating the tropical parameters from the finite case to the tropicalisations of the Schoenberg parameters. Moreover, we show that our finite type tropical parametrisation map is given by Lusztig's weight map from the theory of canonical bases. This results in a surprising connection between the classical Edrei theorem with its Schoenberg parameters and Lusztig's canonical basis parametrisation.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Blake Jackson &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 24 pages, 9 figures. Updated sections 5, 6, and 7 based on detailed feedback from Ralf Schiffler. Added the definition of the quiver of admissible edges, which plays the role of the Auslander-Reiten quiver. Changed the approach used to prove the intersection-dimension formulas. Removed and/or corrected many incorrect notations and comments throughout the document

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a geometric model for the non-$\tau$-rigid modules over acyclic path algebras of type $\widetilde{D}_n$. Similar models have been provided for module categories over path algebras of types $A_n, D_n,$ and $\widetilde{A}_n$ as well as the $\tau$-rigid modules of type $\widetilde{D}_n$. A major draw of these geometric models is the "intersection-dimension formulas" they often come with. These formulas give an equality between the intersection number of the curves representing the modules in the geometric model and the dimension of the extension spaces between the two modules. This formula allows us to calculate the homological data between two modules combinatorially. Since there are infinitely many distinct homogeneous stable tubes in the regular component of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of type $\widetilde{D}_n$, all of which are disjoint, our geometric data requires an extra decoration on the admissible edges in our geometric model to prevent intersections between curves corresponding to modules in distinct stable tubes of the Auslander-Reiten quiver.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages, 5 figures, significantly improved, Theorem 1.4 added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a real semisimple connected Lie group $G$ and a discrete subgroup $\Gamma < G$ we prove a precise connection between growth rates of the group $\Gamma$, polyhedral bounds on the joint spectrum of the ring of invariant differential operators, and the decay of matrix coefficients. In particular, this allows us to completely characterize temperedness of $L^2(\Gamma\backslash G)$ in terms of Quint's growth indicator function. As an application of our sharp polyhedral bounds we prove temperedness of $L^2(\Gamma\backslash G)$ for all Borel Anosov subgroups $\Gamma$ in higher rank Lie groups $G$ not locally isomorphic to $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{K}),\mathbb{K}=\R,\C,\mathbb H,$ or $\mathfrak{e}_{6(-26)}$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zhenhua Liu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Supersedes arXiv:2310.19860 and arXiv:2401.18074. Added a section on further analogies with number theory

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod $n$ homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}.$ As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod $n$ homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected and area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Keiji Okano &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a number field $k$ and an odd prime number $p$, we consider the maximal multiple $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension $\tilde{k}$ of $k$ and the unramified Iwasawa module $X(\tilde{k})$, which is the Galois group of the maximal unramified abelian $p$-extension of $\tilde{k}$. In this article, we classify the CM-fields $k$ in which $p$ splits completely and for which $X(\tilde{k}) = 0$. In addition, we provide an alternative proof of the sufficient condition for $X(\tilde{k})=0$, based on the ideas of Minardi, Itoh, and Fujii in the study of the generalized Greenberg conjecture.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Thang Pham, Semin Yoo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** In the present version, we establish a strong prime-field analogue of a question of Mattila on intersection patterns and prove the rotational Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance problem

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ and $B$ be sets in a finite vector space. In this paper, we study the magnitude of the set $A\cap f(B)$, where $f$ runs through a set of transformations. More precisely, we will focus on the cases that the set of transformations is given by orthogonal matrices or orthogonal projections. One of the most important contributions of this paper is to show that if $A, B\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ satisfy some natural conditions, then, for almost every $g\in O(d)$, there are at least $\gg q^d$ elements $z\in \mathbb{F}_q^d$ such that $$|A\cap (g(B)+z)| \sim \frac{|A||B|}{q^d}.$$ This implies that $|A-gB|\gg q^d$ for almost every $g\in O(d)$. In the flavor of expanding functions, with $|A|\le |B|$, we also show that the image $A-gB$ grows exponentially. In two dimensions, the result simply says that if $|A|=q^x$ and $|B|=q^y$, as long as $0<x\le y<2$, then for almost every $g\in O(2)$, we can always find $\epsilon=\epsilon(x, y)>0$ such that $|A-gB|\gg |B|^{1+\epsilon}$. To prove these results, we need to develop new and robust incidence bounds between points and rigid motions by using a number of techniques including algebraic methods and discrete Fourier analysis. Our results are essentially sharp in odd dimensions. In the prime field plane, we further employ recent $L^2$ distance bounds and point-line/plane incidence machinery to derive improvements. Notable applications include a strong prime field analogue of a question of Mattila related to the Falconer distance problem, the Rotational Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance problem, and a quadratic expansion law. Taken together, the results in this paper present a robust two-way link between intersection phenomena and distance problems over finite fields, with dimension-uniform consequences and sharpness in several ranges.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zhenlu Wang, Ce Xu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 24 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We will employ the method of contour integration to investigate the parity results of non-embedded cyclotomic multiple $t$-values, which we refer to as cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums. We can provide explicit parity formulas for the linear and quadratic cases of cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums, as well as state a parity theorem for the general case. We also present illustrative examples and corollaries. From this, some parity results for classical cyclotomic multiple $t$-values can be derived. Furthermore, we present several general formulas for cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums with denominators involving arbitrary rational polynomials through residue computations. By evaluating these polynomials and computing residues, many other formulas analogous to cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums can be derived. In particular, we also obtain certain parity results for the cyclotomic versions of multiple $T$-values as defined by Kaneko and Tsumura. Finally, we propose some conjectures and questions regarding the parity of cyclotomic multiple $t$-values and cyclotomic multiple $T$-values.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages, 3 tables, comments welcome! Results strengthened so as to apply to all two-sided cells in all types. Now with an appendix by Dmitriy Rumynin. Additionally, typos and mistakes corrected

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We reprove the surjectivity statement of Braverman-Kazhdan's spectral description of Lusztig's asymptotic Hecke algebra $J$ in the context of $p$-adic groups. The proof is based on Bezrukavnikov-Ostrik's description of $J$ in terms of equivariant $K$-theory. As a porism, we prove that the action of $J$ extends from the non-strictly positive unramified characters to the complement of a finite union of divisors, and that the trace pairing between the Ciubotaru-He rigid cocentre of an affine Hecke algebra with equal parameters and the rigid quotient of its Grothendieck group is perfect whenever the parameter $q$ is not a root of the Poincar\'{e} polynomial of the finite Weyl group. Without recourse to $K$-theory, we prove a weak version of Xi's description of $J$ in type $A$. As an application of relationship between $J$ and the rigid cocentre, we prove that the formal degree of a unipotent discrete series representation of a connected reductive $p$-adic group $G$ with a split inner form has denominator dividing the Poincar\'{e} polynomial of the Weyl group of $G$. Additionally, we give formulas for $t_w$ in terms of inverse and spherical Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for $w$ in the lowest cell.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a multiplication formula for cluster characters induced by generating extensions in a gentle algebra A, generalizing a result of Cerulli Irelli, Esposito, Franzen, Reineke. In the case where A is the gentle algebra of a triangulation T of an unpunctured marked surface, this provides a representation-theoretic interpretation of the exchange relations in the cluster algebra with principal coefficients in T. As an application, we interpret a formula that relates cluster variables of type B to cluster variables of type A in the symmetric module category of the algebras arising from special triangulations of a regular polygon.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the bounded derived category of the lattice of order ideals of the product of two ordered chains is fractionally Calabi-Yau. We also show that these lattices are derived equivalent to higher Auslander algebras of type A. The proofs involve the study of intervals of the poset that have resolutions described with antichains having rigid properties. These two results combined corroborate a conjecture by Chapoton linking posets to Fukaya-Seidel Categories.</p></details>

Then we discuss some methods for constructing perfectoid towers, dealing with $p$-torsion free and $p$-torsion cases, respectively. Some interesting examples arise as quotients by monomial or binomial ideals or determinantal rings. We also explain a geometric method with a view toward constructing rings with certain singularities.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Suppose $n$ is the fundamental discriminant associated with a quadratic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. We show that for every Diophantine $m$-tuple $ \{t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m\} $ with the property $ D(n) $, there exists integral ideals $ \mathfrak{t}_1, \mathfrak{t}_2, \ldots, \mathfrak{t}_m $ of $ \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n}) $ and $c\in \{1,2\}$ such that $ t_i= c\mathcal{N}(\mathfrak{t}_i) $ for $ i=1,2, \ldots, m $. Here, $ \mathcal{N}(\cdot) $ denotes the norm map from $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n})$ to $\mathbb{Q}$. Moreover, we explicitly construct the above ideals for Diophantine pairs $\{a_1, a_2\}$ whenever $\gcd(a_1, a_2) = 1$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 68 pages, 13 figures. All comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We generalize the theory of integer $C$-, $G$-matrices in cluster algebras to the real case. By a skew-symmetrizing method, we can reduce the problem of skew-symmetrizable patterns to the one of skew-symmetric patterns. In this sense, we extend the sign-coherence of integer $C$-, $G$-matrices proved by Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich to a more general real class called of quasi-integer type. Furthermore, we give a complete classification of this type by a combinatorial method of real weighted quivers. However, the sign-coherence of real $C$-, $G$-matrices does not always hold in general. For this purpose, we classify all the rank $2$ case and the finite type case via the Coxeter diagrams. We also give two conjectures about the real exchange matrices and $C$-, $G$-matrices. Under these conjectures, the dual mutation, $G$-fan structure and synchronicity property hold. As an application, the isomorphism of several kinds of exchange graphs is studied.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-m})$ be an imaginary quadratic field. We consider the properties of capitulation of the $p$-class group of $k$ in the anti-cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension $k^{\rm ac}$ of $k$; for this, using a new approach based on the Log$_p$-function (Theorems 2.3, 3.4), we determine the first layer $k_1^{\rm ac}$ of $k^{\rm ac}$ over $k$, and we show that some partial capitulation may exist in $k_1^{\rm ac}$, even when $k^{\rm ac}/k$ is totally ramified. We have conjectured that this phenomenon of capitulation is specific of the $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of $k$, distinct from the cyclotomic one. For $p=3$, we characterize a sub-family of fields $k$ (Normal Split cases) for which $k^{\rm ac}$ is not linearly disjoint from the Hilbert class field (Theorem 5.1). No assumptions are made on the splitting of 3 in $k$ and in $k^*=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3m})$, nor on the structures of their 3-class groups. Four PARI/GP programs (7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 depending on the classification of Definition 2.10) are given, computing a defining cubic polynomial of $k_1^{\rm ac}$, and the main invariants attached to the fields $k$, $k^*$, $k_1^{\rm ac}$; some relations with Iwasawa's invariants are discussed (Theorem 9.6).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1920, MacMahon introduced two families of $q$-series to study divisor sums. Recent work has shown that MacMahon's $q$-series are closely connected to overpartitions and $3$-colored partitions. Merca introduced truncated forms of MacMahon's $q$-series to generalize earlier results by Andrews-Rose and Ono-Singh, and posed two conjectures regarding the $q$-binomial expansions of these truncated series. In this paper, we provide combinatorial proofs of Merca's conjectures through the combinatorial interpretation of $q$-binomial coefficients.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the first moment of cubic Hecke $L$-functions over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ evaluated at any $s$ inside the critical strip. The first moment for $s<\frac{1}{2}$ is particularly interesting, and we show there is a phase transition at $s=\frac{1}{3}$. This extends the analogue result of David-Meisner for the first moment over function fields. As in their work, the computation of the moment at $s=\frac{1}{3}$ relies on a cancellation between two terms which are a priori not related: a main term of the principal sum which comes from cubes, and the contribution from infinitely many residues of Dirichlet series of cubic Gauss sums to the dual sum. The cancellation also improves the error term and exhibits a secondary term for all $s$. In particular, at $s=\frac{1}{2}$, we prove the existence of a secondary term of size $Q^{5/6}$, where the size of the family is $Q$. We conjecture that a similar behaviour would hold for higher order Hecke $L$-functions attached to $\ell^{th}$ order residue symbols, refining a function field conjecture of David and Meisner. The proof follows the steps of writing $L(s,\chi)$ as two finite sums with the approximate functional equation. Two main ingredients are then exploited: the bound on the second moment of $L(1/2+it,\chi)$ that follows from Heath-Brown's cubic large sieve, and the deep work of Kubota and Patterson which connects the Dirichlet series of cubic Gauss sums to metaplectic forms, and gives a formula for its residues in terms of the Fourier coefficients of metaplectic theta functions. This is only known for cubic Gauss sums, and not for general Gauss sums of order $\ell\geq 4$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The main objective of this work is to develop a framework for Fourier analysis on the group of signatures, $G_N(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Employing Kirillov's orbit method, we define the Fourier transform on this group via irreducible unitary representations. Our main contribution is the derivation of necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying coadjoint orbits in general position of $G_N(\mathbb{R}^d)$. This enables the computation of the set of \textit{jump-indices} of generic orbits, crucial for the Fourier inversion theorem. We also obtain an explicit construction of a polarization for any linear functional in general position, which allows a concrete description of the Fourier transform of functions on $G_N(\mathbb{R}^d)$. This framework yields an explicit Fourier inversion formula for the group of signatures in arbitrary dimension. Furthermore, we show that the theoretical framework developed here extends naturally to a broader class of graded Lie groups, including the group generated by the truncated tensor algebra $T_0^N(\mathbb{R}^d)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Integral linear systems $Ax=b$ with matrices $A$, $b$ and solutions $x$ are also required to be in integers, can be solved using invariant factors of $A$ (by computing the Smith Canonical Form of $A$). This paper explores a new problem which arises in applications, that of obtaining conditions for solving the Modular Linear System $Ax=b\rem n$ given $A,b$ in $\zz_n$ for $x$ in $\zz_n$ along with the constraint that the value of the linear function $\phi(x)=\la w,x\ra$ is coprime to $n$ for some solution $x$. In this paper we develop decomposition of the system to coprime moduli $p^{r(p)}$ which are divisors of $n$ and show how such a decomposition simplifies the computation of Smith form. This extends the well known index calculus method of computing the discrete logarithm where the moduli over which the linear system is reduced were assumed to be prime (to solve the reduced systems over prime fields) to the case when the factors of the modulus are prime powers $p^{r(p)}$. It is shown how this problem can be addressed effciently using the invariant factors and Smith form of the augmented matrix $[A,-p^{r(p)}I]$ and conditions modulo $p$ satisfied by $w$, where $p^{r(p)}$ vary over all divisors of $n$ with $p$ prime.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the notion of asymptotically positive infinite extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$, in the spirit of the Tsfasman-Vl\u{a}du\c{t} theory of asymptotically exact families of number fields. For asymptotically positive extensions, we obtain lower bounds on the logarithmic Weil height, establishing the Bogomolov property for a wide range of infinite non-Galois extensions. Our result encompasses the famous theorem of E. Bombieri and U. Zannier on Bogomolov property for totally $p$-adic extensions of type $(e,f)$. Additionally, our theorem can be interpreted as a $p$-adic equidistribution result on conjugates of $\alpha$, resonating with the archimedean equidistribution theorem \`{a} la F. Amoroso-M. Mignotte and Y. Bilu. In the parallel setting of elliptic curves, we derive lower bounds on the canonical height for points on an elliptic curve over asymptotically positive extensions, without any restriction on its reduction type. In particular, this extends a result of M. Baker in the context of totally $\nu$-adic extensions, where the elliptic curve is assumed to have semistable reduction at $\nu$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in mathematical research in recent years. This paper applies ML techniques to the study of quivers -- a type of directed multigraph with significant relevance in algebra, combinatorics, computer science, and mathematical physics. Specifically, we focus on the challenging problem of determining the mutation-acyclicity of a quiver on 4 vertices, a property that is pivotal since mutation-acyclicity is often a necessary condition for theorems involving path algebras and cluster algebras. Although this classification is known for quivers with at most 3 vertices, little is known about quivers on more than 3 vertices. We give a computer-assisted proof of a theorem to prove that mutation-acyclicity is decidable for quivers on 4 vertices with edge weight at most 2. By leveraging neural networks (NNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), we then accurately classify more general 4-vertex quivers as mutation-acyclic or non-mutation-acyclic.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Katz and Sarnak conjectured that the behavior of zeros near the central point of any family of $L$-functions is well-modeled by the behavior of eigenvalues near $1$ of some classical compact group (either the symplectic, unitary, or even, odd, or full orthogonal group). In 2018, Knightly and Reno proved that the symmetry group can vary depending on how the $L$-functions in the family are weighted. They observed both orthogonal and symplectic symmetry in the one-level densities of families of cuspidal newform $L$-functions for different choices of weights. We observe the same dependence of symmetry on weights in the $n^{\text{th}}$ centered moments of these one-level densities, for smooth test functions whose Fourier transforms are supported in $\left(-\frac{1}{2n}, \frac{1}{2n}\right)$. To treat the new terms that emerge in our $n$-level calculations when $n>1$, i.e., the cross terms that emerge from $n$-fold products of primes rather than individual primes, we generalize Knightly and Reno's weighted trace formula from primes to arbitrary positive integers. We then perform a delicate analysis of these cross terms to distinguish their contributions to the main and error terms of the $n^{\text{th}}$ centered moments. The final novelty here is an elementary combinatorial trick that we use to rewrite the main number theoretic terms arising from our analysis, facilitating comparisons with random matrix theory.</p></details>

We associate a function on $\mathrm{Spec} R$ with each KE-closed subcategory of $\mathsf{mod} R$, and show that this function completely determines the original subcategory. To classify the functions obtained from KE-closed subcategories, we introduce the notion of an $n$-Bass function for each $n\ge 0$.

> **Comment:** v2: Revised the proofs of Lemmas 4.5 and 5.1, improved the exposition of Proposition 8.1, and added Theorem 8.2

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that in the skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras associated by Felikson-Shapiro-Tumarkin to unpunctured surfaces with orbifold points of order $2$ and a specific choice of weights, the Laurent expansion of any cluster variable with respect to any cluster coincides with the locally free Caldero-Chapoton function of a $\tau$-rigid representation of a gentle algebra. These cluster algebras are typically non-acyclic and of infinite type, whereas for polygons with one orbifold point one recovers cluster algebras of finite type $C$; so, our result is an ample extension of a seminal result established by Geiss-Leclerc-Schr\"oer for skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras of finite type and acyclic initial seeds. As the main means to achieve the result, we provide a generalization of Derksen-Weyman-Zelevinsky's mutation theory of loop-free quivers with potential to the quivers-with-loops with potential we associate to the triangulations of unpunctured surfaces with orbifold points, and study the relation with $\tau$-tilting theory. As a result of independent interest, we compute the aforementioned $\tau$-rigid representations explicitly. To this end, we show that the indecomposable $\tau$-rigid string modules arising from arcs on the surface, and the quasi-simple band modules arising from simple closed curves, are well-behaved under the mutations of representations we define in the paper, thus extending results of the first author's Ph.D. thesis.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an algebraic torus defined over a local (or global) field $F$, a celebrated result of R.P. Langlands establishes a natural homomorphism from the group of continuous cohomology classes of the Weil group, valued in the dual torus, onto the space of complex characters of the rational points of the torus (or automorphic characters in the global case). We expand on this result by detailing its topological aspects. We show that if we topologize the relevant spaces of continuous homomorphisms and continuous cochains using the compact-open topology, Langlands's map becomes a (surjective, finite-to-one) homomorphism of abelian complex Lie groups. Moreover, we demonstrate that, in both the local and global settings, the subset of unramified characters is the identity component of the relevant space of characters. Finally, we compare the group of unramified characters with the Galois (co)invariants of the dual torus.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A degree $d$ genus $g$ cover of the complex projective line by a smooth curve $C$ yields a vector bundle on the projective line by pushforward of the structure sheaf. Which bundles are possible? Equivalently, which $\mathbb{P}^{d-2}$-bundles over $\mathbb{P}^1$ contain such covers? (In the language of many previous papers: what are the scrollar invariants of the cover?) We give a complete answer in degree $4$, which exhibits the expected pathologies. We describe a polytope (one per degree) which we propose gives the complete answer for primitive covers, i.e. covers that don't factor through a subcover. We show that all such bundles (for primitive covers) lie in this polytope, and that a ``positive proportion'' of the polytope arises from smooth covers. Moreover, we show the necessity of the primitivity assumption. Finally, we show that the image of the map from the Hurwitz space of smooth covers to the space of bundles is not preserved by generization (for $d>5$ and $g \gg_d 1$).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a matrix $A \in Z^{k \times n}$ of rank $k$, the diagonal Frobenius number $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ is defined as the minimum $t \in Z_{\geq 1}$, such that, for any $b \in \text{span}_{Z}(A)$, the condition \begin{equation*} \exists x \in R_{\geq 0}^n,\, x \geq t \cdot 1 \colon \quad b = A x \end{equation*} implies that \begin{equation*} \exists z \in Z_{\geq 0}^n \colon\quad b = A z. \end{equation*} In this work, we show that \begin{equation*} F_{\text{diag}}(A) = \Delta + O(\log k), \end{equation*} where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum absolute value of $k \times k$ sub-determinants of $A$. From the computational complexity perspective, we show that the integer vector $z$ can be found by a polynomial-time algorithm for some weaker values of $t$ in the described condition. For example, we can choose $t = O( \Delta \cdot \log k)$ or $t = \Delta + O(\sqrt{k} \cdot \log k)$. Additionally, in the assumption that a $2^k$-time preprocessing is allowed or a base $J$ with $|{\det A_{J}}| = \Delta$ is given, we can choose $t = \Delta + O(\log k)$. Finally, we define a more general notion of the diagonal Frobenius number for slacks $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$, which is a generalization of $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ for canonical-form systems, like $A x \leq b$. All the proofs are mainly done with respect to $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$. The proof technique uses some properties of the Gomory's corner polyhedron relaxation and tools from discrepancy theory.</p></details>

To explain its application towards the Uniform Littlewood's Conjecture proposed in \cite{BFK25}, we introduce the concept of ``fiberwise nondivergence'' for the action of a cone inside the full diagonal subgroup. Then our main result implies that there exists a dense subset of $X_3$ in which each point has a fiberwise non-divergent orbit under a cone inside the full diagonal subgroup and an unbounded orbit under every diagonal flow.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 48 page; comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a revised notion of depth for Langlands parameters for a connected reductive $G$ defined over a nonarchimedean local field $F$ that restores depth preservation under the local Langlands correspondence (LLC) -- in particular for all tori. We leverage that preservation to derive structural results that, taken together, yield a canonical transfer of broad harmonic-analytic results from characteristic $0$ to characteristic $p$. When $F$ has suitably large positive characteristic, we prove a block-by-block equivalence: each Bernstein block of $G(F)$ is equivalent to a corresponding block for some $G'(F')$ with $F'$ of characteristic $0$ $\ell$-close to $F$; using this, we show that an LLC in characteristic $0$ corresponds canonically to an LLC in characteristic $p$. For regular supercuspidals we give a direct, more structured construction via Kaletha. Along the way we recover and extend results on $\ell$-close fields -- introducing a depth-transfer function generalizing the normalized Hasse--Herbrand function, proving truncated isomorphisms for arbitrary tori and parahorics, establishing a depth- and supercuspidality-preserving Kazhdan-type Hecke-algebra isomorphism for arbitrary maximal parahorics of arbitrary connected reductive groups; and a generalized Cartan decomposition for arbitrary maximal parahorics -- thereby subsuming several earlier results in the literature. Collectively, the results let one work in characteristic $0$ without loss of generality for a wide swath of harmonic analysis on $p$-adic groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{G}=\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ be a finite and flat group scheme over the ring of algebraic integers $R$ of a number field $K$ and suppose that the generic fiber of $\mathcal{G}$ is the constant group scheme over $K$ for a finite group $G$. Then the $R$-dual $A^D$of $A$ identifies as a Hopf $R$-order in the group algebra $K[G]$. If $B$ is a principal homogeneous space for $A$, then it is known that $B$ is a locally free $A^D$-module. By multiplying the trace form of $B_K/K$ by a certain scalar we obtain a $G$-invariant form $Tr'_B$ which provides a non-degenerate $R$-form on $B$. If $G$ has odd order, we show that the $G$-forms $(B, Tr'_B)$ and $(A, Tr'_A)$ are locally isomorphic and we study the question of when they are globally isomorphic. Suppose now that $K$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb Q_p$ with valuation ring $R$. In the course of our study we are led to consider the extension of scalars map $\varphi_K: G_0(A^D)\rightarrow G_0(A^D_K)=G_0(K[G])$. When $A^D$ is the group ring $R[G]$, Swan showed that $\varphi_K$ is an isomorphism. Jensen and Larson proved that $\varphi_K$ is also an isomorphism for any Hopf $R$-order $A^D$ of $K[G]$ when $G$ is abelian and $K$ is large enough. Here we prove that $\ker \varphi_K$ is at most a finite abelian $p$-group. However, numerous examples lead us to conjecture that Swan's result extends to all Hopf $R$-orders in $K[G]$, i.e. $\ker \varphi_K$ is always trivial.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p\in\mathbb Z$ be a prime, $\overline{\mathbb Q_p}$ a fixed algebraic closure of the field of $p$-adic numbers and $\overline{\mathbb Z_p}$ the absolute integral closure of the ring of $p$-adic integers. Given a residually algebraic torsion extension $W$ of $\mathbb Z_{(p)}$ to $\mathbb Q(X)$, by Kaplansky's characterization of immediate extensions of valued fields, there exists a pseudo-convergent sequence of transcendental type $E=\{s_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}\subset\overline{\mathbb Q_p}$ such that $W=\mathbb Z_{(p),E}=\{\phi\in\mathbb Q(X)\mid\phi(s_n)\in\overline{\mathbb Z_p},\text{ for all sufficiently large }n\in\mathbb N\}$. We show here that we may assume that $E$ is stacked, in the sense that, for each $n\in\mathbb N$, the residue field (the value group, respectively) of $\overline{\mathbb Z_p}\cap\mathbb Q_p(s_n)$ is contained in the residue field (the value group, respectively) of $\overline{\mathbb Z_p}\cap\mathbb Q_p(s_{n+1})$; this property of $E$ allows us to describe the residue field and value group of $W$. In particular, if $W$ is a DVR, then there exists $\alpha$ in the completion $\mathbb C_p$ of $\overline{\mathbb Q_p}$, $\alpha$ transcendental over $\mathbb Q$, such that $W=\mathbb Z_{(p),\alpha}=\{\phi\in\mathbb Q(X)\mid\phi(\alpha)\in O_p\}$, where $O_p$ is the unique local ring of $\mathbb C_p$; $\alpha$ belongs to $\overline{\mathbb Q_p}$ if and only if the residue field extension $W/M\supseteq\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z$ is finite. As an application, we provide a full characterization of the Dedekind domains between $\mathbb Z[X]$ and $\mathbb Q[X]$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(G,G_1)$ be a symmetric pair of holomorphic type, and we consider a pair of Hermitian symmetric spaces $D_1=G_1/K_1\subset D=G/K$, realized as bounded symmetric domains in complex vector spaces $\mathfrak{p}^+_1\subset\mathfrak{p}^+$ respectively. Then the universal covering group $\widetilde{G}$ of $G$ acts unitarily on the weighted Bergman space $\mathcal{H}_\lambda(D)\subset\mathcal{O}(D)$ on $D$. Its restriction to the subgroup $\widetilde{G}_1$ decomposes discretely and multiplicity-freely, and its branching law is given explicitly by Hua--Kostant--Schmid--Kobayashi's formula in terms of the $K_1$-decomposition of the space $\mathcal{P}(\mathfrak{p}^+_2)$ of polynomials on the orthogonal complement $\mathfrak{p}^+_2$ of $\mathfrak{p}^+_1$ in $\mathfrak{p}^+$. The object of this article is to construct explicitly $\widetilde{G}_1$-intertwining operators (symmetry breaking operators) $\mathcal{H}_\lambda(D)|_{\widetilde{G}_1}\to\mathcal{H}_{\varepsilon_1\lambda}(D_1,\mathcal{P}_{\mathbf{k}}(\mathfrak{p}^+_2))$ from holomorphic discrete series representations of $\widetilde{G}$ to those of $\widetilde{G}_1$, which are unique up to constant multiple for sufficiently large $\lambda$. These operators are given by differential operators whose symbols are computed as the inner products of polynomials on $\mathfrak{p}^+_2$. In this article, we treat the case $\mathfrak{p}^+,\mathfrak{p}^+_2$ are both simple of tube type and $\mathrm{rank}\mathfrak{p}^+=\mathrm{rank}\mathfrak{p}^+_2$. When $\mathrm{rank}\mathfrak{p}^+=3$, we treat all partitions $\mathbf{k}$, and when $\mathrm{rank}\mathfrak{p}^+$ is general, we treat partitions of the form $\mathbf{k}=(k,\ldots,k,k-l)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that once $\theta>17/30$, every sufficiently long interval $[x,x+x^\theta]$ contains many $k$-term arithmetic progressions of primes, uniformly in the starting point $x$. More precisely, for each fixed $k\ge3$ and $\theta>17/30$, for all sufficiently large $X$ and all $x\in[X,2X]$, $$ \#\{\text{$k$-APs of primes in }[x,x+x^\theta]\}\ \gg_{k,\theta}\ \frac{N^{2}}{\big((\varphi(W)/W)^{k}(\log R)^{k}\big)}\ \asymp\ \frac{X^{2\theta}}{(\log X)^{k+1+o(1)}}, $$ where $W:=\prod_{p\le \tfrac12\log\log X}p$, $N:=\lfloor x^\theta/W\rfloor$, and $R:=N^\eta$ for a small fixed $\eta=\eta(k,\theta)>0$. This is obtained by combining the uniform short-interval prime number theorem at exponents $\theta>17/30$ (a consequence of recent zero-density estimates of Guth and Maynard) with the Green-Tao transference principle (in the relative Szemer\'edi form) on a window-aligned $W$-tricked block. We also record a concise Maynard-type lemma on dense clusters \emph{restricted to a fixed congruence class} in tiny intervals $(\log x)^\varepsilon$, which we use as a warm-up and for context. An appendix contains a short-interval Barban-Davenport-Halberstam mean square bound (uniform in $x$) that we use as a black box for variance estimates.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The cluster variety of triples of flags (associated with a split simple Lie group of Dynkin type Delta) plays a key role in higher Teichmuller theory as developed by Fock-Goncharov, Jiarui Fei, Ian Le, ... and Goncharov-Shen. We refer to it as the basic triangle associated with Delta. In this paper, for simply laced Delta, we construct and study a Higgs category (in the sense of Yilin Wu) which we expect to categorify the basic triangle. This category is a certain exact dg category (in the sense of Xiaofa Chen) which is Frobenius and stably 2-Calabi-Yau. We show that it has indeed the expected cyclic group symmetry and that its derived category has the expected braid group symmetry. A key ingredient in our construction is a conjecture by Merlin Christ, whose proof occupies most of this paper. The proof is based on a new description of the Higgs category in terms of Gorenstein projective dg modules. Our techniques are in the spirit of Orlov in his work on triangulated categories of graded B-branes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The eigenvectors of the $(N+1)\times (N+1)$ symmetric Pascal matrix $T_N$ are analogs of prolate spheroidal wave functions in the discrete setting. The generating functions of the eigenvectors of $T_N$ are prolate spheroidal functions in the sense that they are simultaneously eigenfunctions of a third-order differential operator and an integral operator over the critical line $\{z\in\mathbb{C}: \text{Re}(z) = 1/2\}$. For even, positive integers $N$, we obtain an explicit formula for the generating function of an eigenvector of the symmetric pascal matrix with eigenvalue $1$. In the special case when $N=p-1$ for an odd prime $p$, we show that the generating function is equivalent modulo $p$ to $(\# E_z(\mathbb F_p)-1)^2$, where $\# E_z(\mathbb F_p)$ is the number of points on the Legendre elliptic curve $y^2 = x(x-1)(x-z)$ over the finite field $\mathbb F_p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We generalize Balmer and Gallauer's (permutation) twisted cohomology ring, working toward an alternative method of deducing the Balmer spectrum of the derived category of permutation modules for any finite $p$-group. The construction comes equipped with a canonical comparison map from the Balmer spectrum to the homogeneous spectrum of the twisted cohomology ring. We show the comparison map is injective for any finite $p$-group and furthermore, an open immersion when the twisted cohomology ring is noetherian. For elementary abelian $p$-groups, the twisted cohomology ring coincides with Balmer and Gallauer's original construction. To perform this construction, we utilize endotrivial complexes (i.e. the invertible objects of the derived category of permutation modules) arising up to a shift from Bredon homology of representation spheres. This topological structure allows us to construct certain $p$-local isomorphisms, from which we build a refined open cover of the Balmer spectrum indexed by conjugacy classes of subgroups of $G$. Under this open cover, every endotrivial is isomorphic to a shift of the tensor unit in each localization, thus verifying that all endotrivials are line bundles. When the twisted cohomology ring is noetherian, this open cover endows the Balmer spectrum with Dirac scheme structure.</p></details>

In the present article we try to prove an equivalence theorem of the existence and the uniqueness of the solution of the equation of the form:\\ $H_{t}^{2}\left(x\right) -H_{t}\left( x\right) +t\equiv 0\ \ \left( \mathrm{mod}\text{ }t^{n}\right) $, by using the same recurrence formula introduced in \cite{wildberger2025hyper} between the Catalan sequence terms: $C_{n+1}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}C_{k}C_{n-k}$. We introduce Wildberger's polynumber sequences, binomial Chu-Vandermonde identity, truncated polyseries and finally modular resolution as application.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the equivariant cohomology of the moduli space of quasimaps from $\mathbb{P}^1$ with one marked point to the flag variety. This moduli space has an open subset isomorphic to the Laumon space. The equivariant cohomology of the Laumon space carries a natural action of $U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ constructed via geometric correspondences. We extend this construction to the entire quasimap moduli space and relate it to tilting modules of $U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a semisimple algebraic group over the complex numbers and $K$ be a connected reductive group mapping to $G$ so that the Lie algebra of $K$ gets identified with a symmetric subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$. So we can talk about Harish-Chandra $(\mathfrak{g},K)$-modules, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is the Lie algebra of $G$. The goal of this paper is to give a geometric classification of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules with full support over the filtered quantizations of the algebras of the form $\mathbb{C}[\mathbb{O}]$, where $\mathbb{O}$ is a nilpotent orbit in $\mathfrak{g}$ with codimension of the boundary at least $4$. Namely, we embed the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules into the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible $K$-equivariant suitably twisted local systems on $\mathbb{O}\cap \mathfrak{k}^\perp$. We show that under certain conditions, for example when $K\subset G$ or when $\mathfrak{g}\cong \mathfrak{so}_n,\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$, this embedding is in fact a bijection. On the other hand, for $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_n$ and $K=\mathrm{Spin}_n$, the embedding is not bijective and we give a description of the image. Finally, we perform a partial classification for exceptional Lie algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the triple convolution sum of the generalised divisor functions given by $$\sum_{n\leq x} d_k(n+h)d_l(n)d_m(n-h),$$ where $h \le x^{1-\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon>0$ and $d_k(n)$ denotes the generalised divisor function which counts the number of ways $n$ can be written as product of $k$ many positive integers. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, we note a predicted asymptotic estimate for the above sum, where the constant appearing in the estimate can be obtained from the theory of Dirichlet series of several complex variables and also using some probabilistic arguments. Then we show that a lower bound of the correct order can be derived using the several variable Tauberian theorems, where, more importantly, the constant in the predicted asymptotic can be recovered.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate a notion of "higher modularity" for elliptic curves over function fields. Given such an elliptic curve $E$ and an integer $r\geq 1$, we say that $E$ is $r$-modular when there is an algebraic correspondence between a stack of $r$-legged shtukas, and the $r$-fold product of $E$ considered as an elliptic surface. The (known) case $r=1$ is analogous to the notion of modularity for elliptic curves over $\mathbf{Q}$. Our main theorem is that if $E/\mathbf{F}_q(t)$ is a nonisotrivial elliptic curve whose conductor has degree 4, then $E$ is 2-modular. Ultimately, the proof uses properties of K3 surfaces. Along the way we prove a result of independent interest: A K3 surface admits a finite morphism to a Kummer surface attached to a product of elliptic curves if and only if its Picard lattice is rationally isometric to the Picard lattice of such a Kummer surface.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The lattices $D_4$ and $E_8$ are known to be the densest lattices in dimensions 4 and 8, respectively. In this paper, we employ tools from algebraic number theory to prove that the $D_4$-lattice arises from an infinite family of totally imaginary biquadratic fields. Furthermore, we extend this construction to show that both the $D_8$ and $E_8$ can be realized via triquadratic fields derived from this family.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the question whether a real threefold X fibred into quadric surfaces over the real projective line is stably rational (over R) if the topological space X(R) is connected. We give a counterexample. When all geometric fibres are irreducible, the question is open. We investigate a family of such fibrations for which the intermediate jacobian technique is not available. We produce two independent methods which in many cases enable one to prove decomposition of the diagonal.</p></details>
