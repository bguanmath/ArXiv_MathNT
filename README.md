<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a number field $k$ with the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_k$ and a matrix $M\in \mathrm{M}_{n}(\mathcal{O}_k)$. We prove that if $\mathcal{O}_k$ is a principal ideal domain, the local-global principle for triangularizability and diagonalizability of $M$ holds. To explain the possible failures of the local-global principle, we prove that the stratified Brauer--Manin obstruction is the only obstruction to the local-global principle for triangularizability and diagonalizability of $M$ in some special cases.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a theory of partially defined complete positivity preservers, extending Schoenberg's classical characterization to functions defined only on discrete subsets or constrained domains. We frame the extension problem through the theory of completely positive maps on operator systems -- we characterize general partially defined completely positive definite functions on general homogeneous spaces. We apply our interpolation to constrained packing problems and Delsarte theory, where one uses positive definite functions on homogeneous spaces to obtain bounds on various packing problems. We prove the specific positive definite function witnesses that a code is sharp for constrained angle codes must be from polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish the existence of many holomorphic Hecke eigenforms $f$ of large weight $k$ for the full modular group, for which the least positive integer $n_f$ such that $λ_f(n_f)<0$ satisfies $n_f \ge (\log k)^{1-o(1)}.$ This is believed to be best possible up to the $o(1)$ term in the exponent, and improves on a result of Kowalski, Lau, Soundararajan and Wu, who showed that, when restricted to primes, the least prime $p$ such that $λ_f(p)<0$ can be as large as $(\log k)^{1/2+o(1)}$. We also discuss an extension of our result to primitive holomorphic cusp forms of weight $k$ and squarefree level $N\geq 1$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 134 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a formalism of Hochschild (co)-homology for $\mathcal{D}$-cap modules on smooth rigid analytic spaces based on the homological tools of Ind-Banach $\mathcal{D}$-cap modules. We introduce several categories of $\mathcal{D}$-cap bimodules for which this theory is well-behaved. Among these, the most important example is the category of diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complexes. We give an explicit calculation of the Hochschild complex for diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complexes, and show that the Hochschild complex of $\mathcal{D}$-cap is canonically isomorphic to the de Rham complex of $X$. In particular, we obtain a Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence converging to the Hochschild cohomology groups of $\mathcal{D}$-cap. We obtain explicit formulas relating the Hochschild cohomology and homology of a given diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complex.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Katalin Gyarmati, Károly Müllner &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Studia Scientiarum Mathematicarum Hungarica (to appear)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The primary objective of this section is to demonstrate that the actual pseudorandom measures of our construction are significantly smaller than the theoretical upper bounds derived from the Weil theorem. Regarding the family of sequences, we note that the construction $E_{f,g,h}$ allows for a large variety of sequences by choosing different triples of polynomials. While the detailed analysis of the cross-correlation measure of such a family is a challenging problem and lies beyond the scope of the present paper, the structure of the construction suggests that sequences generated by different polynomials will remain nearly orthogonal. Indeed, since each sequence is built from distinct Legendre symbol sequences with proven low correlation, their combinations are expected to maintain the same level of independence.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the concept of a triangular decomposition for Banach and Fréchet-Stein algebras over $p$-adic fields, which allows us to define a category $\mathcal{O}$ for a wide array of topological algebras. In particular, we apply this concept to $p$-adic rational Cherednik algebras, which allows us to obtain an analytic version of the category $\mathcal{O}$ developed by Ginzburg, Guay, Opdam and Rouquier. Along the way, we study the global sections of $p$-adic Cherednik algebras on smooth Stein spaces, and determine their behavior with respect to the rigid analytic GAGA functor.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tian Wang, Pengcheng Zhang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a $g$-dimensional abelian variety defined over a number field $F$. It is conjectured that the set of ordinary primes of $A$ over $F$ has positive density, and this is known to be true when $g=1, 2$, or for certain abelian varieties with extra endomorphisms. In this paper, we extend the family of abelian varieties whose sets of ordinary primes have positive density. Specifically, we show that if the endomorphism algebra of $A$ contains a number field $K$ of degree $g$, then under certain conditions on the fields $F$ and $K$, the set of ordinary primes of $A$ over $F$ has positive density. This includes $\mathrm{GL}_2$-type abelian varieties over $\mathbb{Q}$ (resp. quadratic number fields) of dimension $q$ or $2q$ (resp. $q$) for any rational prime $q$. The proof is carried out in the general setting of compatible systems of Galois representations, and as a consequence, it also implies a positive density result for the sets of ordinary primes of certain modular forms of weight $2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X$ be a smooth rigid space with an action of a finite group $G$ satisfying that $X/G$ is represented by a rigid space. We construct sheaves of $p$-adic Cherednik algebras on the small étale site of the quotient $X/G$, and study some of their properties. The sheaves of $p$-adic Cherednik algebras are sheaves of Fréchet-Stein $K$-algebras on $X/G$, which can be regarded as $p$-adic analytic versions of the sheaves of Cherednik algebras associated to the action of a finite group on a smooth algebraic variety defined by P. Etingof.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that semi-arithmetic surfaces of arithmetic dimension two which admit a modular embedding have exponential growth of mean multiplicities in their length spectrum. Prior to this work large mean multiplicities were rigorously confirmed only for the length spectra of arithmetic surfaces. We also discuss the relation of the degeneracies in the length spectrum and quantization of the Hamiltonian mechanical system on the surface.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kushal Bhowmick, Aprameyo Pal &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 14 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Our main objective in this paper is to study the average rank of the $2$-Selmer group of the elliptic curve associated with the $\fracπ{3}$-congruent number problem. Following Heath-Brown's strategy, we could find an asymptotic formula for the size of the relaxed $2$-Selmer groups, which has several consequences towards the average of $2$-Selmer ranks and $\fracπ{3}$-congruent number problem. Indeed, we could find an unconditional positive density of $2$-Selmer rank being $1$ or $3$, among the positive square-free integers $n\equiv 13\pmod{24}$ having all the prime divisors congruent to $1$ modulo $4$ and an unconditional positive density of $2$-Selmer rank being $0$ or $2$, among the positive square-free integers $n\equiv 5\pmod{24}$ having all the prime divisors congruent to $1$ modulo $4$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: accepted version. To appear in Bull. Amer. Math. Soc

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we review the construction and large $N$ study of the continuous two-dimensional Yang--Mills theory with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(N)$ through probability, combinatorics and representation theory. In the first part, we define the continuous Yang--Mills measure using Markovian holonomy fields, following a construction by Lévy, then we show in the second part how to derive the character expansion of the partition function for any compact structure group from this setting. We continue with two developments obtained in the last few years by Dahlqvist, Lemoine, Lévy and Maïda with similar approaches with respect to the partition function: its large-$N$ asymptotics on all compact surfaces for the structure group $\mathrm{U}(N)$, and its $\frac{1}{N}$ expansion on a torus with an interpretation in terms of random surfaces.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jean-François Burnol &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 6 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We represent the Euler alternating series (sometimes called the "Dirichlet eta function"), and generally $(b^s-b)ζ(s)/b^s$ for $b>1$ an integer, in the half-plane $\Re s>0$, via series dominated by geometric series, with arbitrarily small convergence ratio (up to the prize of a longer first approximation). Due to the underlying recurrence, the cost for each new term is at first sight linearly increasing, so the cost appears to be quadratic in the number of terms kept. And the number of terms needed to achieve a given target precision increases linearly with the imaginary part of $s$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Reinier Sorgdrager &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that an admissible $p$-adic Banach representation of $\text{GL}_2K$ whose locally analytic vectors have an infinitesimal character has Gelfand-Kirillov dimension $\leq[K\colon\mathbf Q_p]$, where $p>2$ and $K$ is a $p$-adic field. We also prove this for the group of units of the quaternions over $K$ replacing $\text{GL}_2K$. In the process, we make some observations in the theory of $p$-adic Banach representations that might be of independent interest.</p></details>

> **Comment:** After publication, we learned that the cardinality of $X_3$ was obtained by C. Gurwood (PhD thesis, 1976) by fully characterizing $X(0)$. The result was later reproved by a different method by G. Harcos (undergraduate thesis, 1996, Hungarian). Our method allows the construction of uncountably many irrational numbers in each X(n) with Sturmian continued fraction after substituting a=(2,2), b=(1,1)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $c>0$, let $X_c$ denote the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|<\frac{1}{cq^2}$ has only finitely many rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$. It is a classical fact, known since the 1950s, that $X_c$ is uncountable for $c>3$ and countable for $c<3$. However, the cardinality of $X_3$ does not appear to be present in the literature. We prove that $X_3$ is uncountable. More generally, we show that for any $n\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$, the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ with Lagrange value exactly $3$ and such that $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|<\frac{1}{3q^2}$ has exactly $n$ rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$ is also uncountable.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Representative examples of our results are as follows.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study additively indecomposable quadratic forms over real biquadratic and simplest cubic fields. In particular, we show that over these fields, we can always find such a classical form in 2 variables, which differs from the situation for forms over integers. Moreover, for some cases, we derive a lower bound on the number of classical, additively indecomposable binary quadratic forms up to equivalence.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 86 + 45 pages; v2: minor corrections; v3: updated terminology on interchange identities

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A recent construction of polylogarithms on Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus in arXiv:2306.08644 is based on a flat connection assembled from single-valued non-holomorphic integration kernels that depend on two points on the Riemann surface. In this work, we construct and prove infinite families of bilinear relations among these integration kernels that are necessary for the closure of the space of higher-genus polylogarithms under integration over the points on the surface. Our bilinear relations generalize the Fay identities among the genus-one Kronecker-Eisenstein kernels to arbitrary genus. The multiple-valued meromorphic kernels in the flat connection of Enriquez are conjectured to obey higher-genus Fay identities of exactly the same form as their single-valued non-holomorphic counterparts. We initiate the applications of Fay identities to derive functional relations among higher-genus polylogarithms involving either single-valued or meromorphic integration kernels.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 66 pages, 2 figures, comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a metric-dependent geometric variant of factorization homology in conformally flat Riemannian geometry for $d \geq 2$. We introduce a symmetric monoidal category of germs of d-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and orientation-preserving conformal open embeddings, and its full monoidal subcategory generated by flat disks. A conformally flat $d$-disk algebra is a symmetric monoidal functor from this disk category to a target category; in this paper we take the target to be $\mathrm{IndHilb}$, the ind-category of Hilbert spaces, which provides a mathematical formulation of $d$-dimensional conformal field theories. The (1-categorical) left Kan extension of an $\mathrm{IndHilb}$-valued conformally flat $d$-disk algebra defines a metric-dependent invariant of conformally flat manifolds. Under suitable positivity and continuity assumptions, we prove that its value on the standard sphere $(S^d,g_{\mathrm{std}})$ reproduces the sphere partition function of the associated conformal field theory. For $d>2$, we construct nontrivial $\mathrm{IndHilb}$-valued conformally flat $d$-disk algebras from unitary representations of $\mathrm{SO}^+(d,1)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $N$ be a prime and $φ$ be a Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform for the Hecke congruence subgroup $Γ_0(N)$ in $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{R})$. Let $Ω$ be an adelic compactum and let $Ω_N$ be its projection to $Γ_0(N) \backslash \mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{R}) / \mathrm{SO}(n)$. For any prime $n$, we prove sub-baseline bounds for the sup-norm of $φ$ restricted to $Ω_N$. Conditionally on GRH, we generalise this result to all $n \geq 2$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>These are notes from the lectures I gave at the Oberwolfach seminar `Tensor Triangular Geometry and Interactions' which was held in October 2025. The aim of these notes is to give an introduction to tensor triangular geometry, for both small and large categories, through the lens of lattice theory. We do not try to be exhaustive and this is reflected in both the content and the bibliography. For instance we are quite light on triangulated preliminaries, especially for compactly generated categories. The first three sections treat the essentially small case and conclude with a tensor triangular proof of Thomason's theorem computing the spectrum of the perfect complexes on a quasi-compact and quasi-separated scheme. The last section treats the compactly generated case. This final section is somewhat experimental and contains some new thoughts.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Some representation-theoretic multiplicities, such as the Kostka and the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, admit a combinatorial interpretation that places their computation in the complexity class #P. Whether this holds more generally is considered an important open problem in mathematics and computer science, with relevance for geometric complexity theory and quantum information. Recent work has investigated the quantum complexity of particular multiplicities, such as the Kronecker coefficients and certain special cases of the plethysm coefficients. Here, we show that a broad class of representation-theoretic multiplicities is in #BQP. In particular, our result implies that the plethysm coefficients are in #BQP, which was only known in special cases. It also implies all known results on the quantum complexity of previously studied coefficients as special cases, unifying, simplifying, and extending prior work. We obtain our result by multiple applications of the Schur transform. Recent work has improved its dependence on the local dimension, which is crucial for our work. We further describe a general approach for showing that representation-theoretic multiplicities are in #BQP that captures our approach as well as the approaches of prior work. We complement the above by showing that the same multiplicities are also naturally in GapP and obtain polynomial-time classical algorithms when certain parameters are fixed.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Geometric Manin's conjecture predicts that components of the moduli space of curves on a Fano variety parametrizing non-free curves are pathological and arise from "accumulating" morphisms that increase the Fujita invariant. By passing to positive characteristic and employing a higher genus generalization of the circle method, we prove a converse to this conjecture for general hypersurfaces $X$ in $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ of degree $d\le n/4+3/2$, namely that there are no such accumulating maps to $X$. One consequence of this is a version of Poincaré duality for these moduli spaces in a range.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the following statement about any Siegel modular form $F$ of degree $n$ and arbitrary odd level $N$ on the group $Γ_{0}^{(n)}(N)$. Let $A(F,T)$ denote the Fourier coefficients of $F$ and write $T=(T(i,j))$. Suppose that $F$ has a non-zero Fourier coefficient $A(F,T_0)$ such that $(T_0(n,n),N)=1$. Then there exist infinitely many odd and square-free (and thus fundamental) integers $m$ such that $m=\mathrm{discriminant}(T)$ and $A(F,T)\neq 0$. In the case of odd degrees, we prove a stronger result by replacing odd and square-free with odd and prime. We also prove quantitative results in this direction. As a consequence, we can show in particular that the statement of the main result in arXiv:2408.03442 about the algebraicity of certain critical values (and the expected functional equation) of the spinor $L$-functions of holomorphic newforms (in the ambit of Deligne's conjectures) on congruence subgroups of $\mathrm{GSp}(3)$ is unconditional.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A theorem of R. Travkin and R. Yang, initially conjectured by D. Gaiotto, states that for a generic (not a root of unity) $q$ the category of $q$-twisted D-modules on the affine Grassmannian $Gr_{GL_N}$ which are equivariant with respect to a certain subgroup (defined by a choice of $0 \le M <N$) of $GL_N$ is equivalent to the category of representations of the quantum supergroup $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(M|N))$. We aim to see whether this equivalence should hold when $q$ is a root of unity. We begin by asking if there is a natural bijection between the sets of irreducible objects. In this note we make an observation that suggests this should be the case: we show that there is a natural bijection between irreducible objects in the Gaiotto category and in the category of representations of a supergroup $GL(M|N)$ in positive characteristic. The proof is based on the version of the Serganova's algorithm formulated by J. Brundan and J. Kujawa in arXiv:math/0210108.</p></details>

We prove a large family of relations among these series and propose an explicit conjectural formula for their derivatives. This formula is expressed using the double shuffle structure and the Drop1 operator introduced by Hirose, Maesaka, Seki, and Watanabe. Based on this, we propose a family of linear relations that is conjectured to generate all linear relations among multiple Eisenstein series.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the problem of certifying (strict) $k$-sign consistency of a matrix, that is, whether all of its $k$-th order minors share the same (strict) sign. Although this problem is generally of combinatorial complexity, we show that for Hankel matrices it can be significantly simplified: our sufficient condition requires checking only the $k$-th order minors of a reshaped Hankel matrix with $k$ rows. Remarkably, when applied to the Hankel operator, this sufficient condition is also necessary. Comparable results were known only in the setting of (strictly) $k$-positive Hankel matrices and operators, in which all minors of order up to $k$ have the same (strict) sign. More concretely, we derive a formula expressing the $k$-th order minors of Hankel matrices as nonnegative integer linear combinations of $k$-th order minors with consecutive row indices. Our derivation uses Schur polynomial theory to show that the $k$-th order minors of any matrix are nonnegative integer linear combinations of row-consecutive $k$-th order minors, meaning minors formed from distinct columns whose consecutive row indices need not coincide across columns. For Hankel matrices, these minors coincide -- up to sign changes arising from column swaps -- with the usual $k$-th order minors with consecutive row indices. Our main result then follows by showing that the sum of certain signed nonnegative integer coefficients equals the corresponding Littlewood--Richardson coefficients. In our problem, the nonnegativity of these coefficients ensures that negatively signed column permutations are cancelled by positively signed ones. Our results also extend naturally to Toeplitz matrices and operators, and we present a partial analogue for circulant matrices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The loop group $G((z^{-1}))$ of a simple complex Lie group $G$ has a natural Poisson structure. We introduce a natural family of Poisson commutative subalgebras $\overline{\mathbf{B}}(C) \subset \mathcal{O}(G((z^{-1}))$ depending on the parameter $C\in G$ called classical universal Bethe subalgebras. To every antidominant cocharacter $μ$ of the maximal torus $T \subset G$ one can associate the closed Poisson subspace $\mathcal{W}_μ$ of $G((z^{-1}))$ (the Poisson algebra $\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{W}_μ)$ is the classical limit of so-called shifted Yangian $Y_μ(\mathfrak{g})$). We consider the images of $\overline{\mathbf{B}}(C)$ in $\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{W}_μ)$, that we denote by $\overline{B}_μ(C)$, that should be considered as classical versions of (not yet defined in general) Bethe subalgebras in shifted Yangians. For regular $C$ centralizing $μ$, we compute the Poincaré series of these subalgebras. For $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{gl}_n$, we define the natural quantization ${\mathbf{Y}}^{\mathrm{rtt}}(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ of $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{Mat}_n((z^{-1}))))$ and universal Bethe subalgebras ${\mathbf{B}}(C) \subset {\mathbf{Y}}^{\mathrm{rtt}}(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$. Using the RTT realization of $Y_μ(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ (invented by Frassek, Pestun, and Tsymbaliuk), we obtain the natural surjections ${\mathbf{Y}}^{\mathrm{rtt}}(\mathfrak{gl}_n) \twoheadrightarrow Y_μ(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ which quantize the embedding $\mathcal{W}_μ\subset \mathrm{Mat}_n((z^{-1}))$). Taking the images of ${\mathbf{B}}(C)$ in $Y_μ(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ we recover Bethe subalgebras $B_μ(C) \subset Y_μ(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ proposed by Frassek, Pestun and Tsymbaliuk.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1927, Artin and Schreier showed that a field is real closed if and only if its absolute Galois group has order two. Inspired by this characterisation and drawing on earlier work of Neukirch, Pop conjectured the following $p$-adic analogue: a field is $p$-adically closed if and only if its absolute Galois group is isomorphic to that of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. In 1995, the conjecture was independently solved by Efrat for $p \ne 2$ and by Koenigsmann in full generality. Using novel techniques in the theory of valued fields developed over the last 25 years, we give a new elementary and self-contained proof of this theorem, which does not rely on local class field theory and Galois cohomology. We further highlight connections to the recent work of Jahnke-Kartas on perfectoid fields and model-theoretic transfer techniques. We provide a systematic account of all of our methods to encourage further investigations.</p></details>

We construct an open cover of the Balmer spectrum under which all endotrivials are line bundles, that is, every endotrivial is locally isomorphic to a shifted tensor unit. We define a 'remixed' permutation twisted cohomology ring for which the canonical comparison map from the Balmer spectrum to the homogeneous spectrum of the twisted cohomology ring is injective. If the twisted cohomology ring is Noetherian, the comparison map is an open immersion, and the open cover endows the Balmer spectrum with Dirac scheme structure.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an effective stabilization result for the sheaf cohomology groups of line bundles on flag varieties parametrizing complete flags in k^n, as well as for the sheaf cohomology groups of polynomial functors applied to the cotangent sheaf Omega on projective space. In characteristic zero, these are natural consequences of the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem, but in characteristic p>0 they are non-trivial. Unlike many important contexts in modular representation theory, where the prime characteristic p is assumed to be large relative to n, in our study we fix p and let n go to infinity. We illustrate the general theory by providing explicit stable cohomology calculations in a number of cases of interest. Our examples yield cohomology groups where the number of indecomposable summands has super-polynomial growth, and also show that the cohomological degrees where non-vanishing occurs do not form a connected interval. In the case of polynomial functors of Omega, we prove a Kunneth formula for stable cohomology, and show the invariance of stable cohomology under Frobenius, which combined with the Steinberg tensor product theorem yields calculations of stable cohomology for an interesting class of simple polynomial functors arising in the work of Doty. The results in the special case of symmetric powers of Omega provide a nice application to commutative algebra, yielding a sharp vanishing result for Koszul modules of finite length in all characteristics.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The hybrid quantum group was firstly introduced by Gaitsgory, whose category $\mathcal{O}$ can be viewed as a quantum analogue of BGG category $\mathcal{O}$. We give a coherent model for its principal block at roots of unity, using the non-commutative Springer resolution defined by Bezrukavnikov--Mirković. In particular, the principal block is derived equivalent to the affine Hecke category. As an application, we endow the principal block with a canonical grading, and show that the graded multiplicity of simple module in Verma module is given by the generic Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the global Jacquet--Langlands correspondence ${\rm JL}$ for ${\rm GL}(2)$ can be realized via tensor products over Hecke algebras. Let $G$ be a non-split inner form of ${\rm GL}(2)$ over a number field. Using the similitude theta correspondence, the space $L^2(D(\mathbb{A})\times \mathbb{A}^{\times})$ acquires the structure of a $G(\mathbb{A})$-$(G(\mathbb{A})\times {\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{A}))$ bimodule such that $L^2(G(F)\backslash G(\mathbb{A}),χ)\otimes_{\mathcal{H}(G)}L^2(D(\mathbb{A})\times \mathbb{A}^{\times})~\cong~\oplus_{π\in {\mathcal{A}}(G,χ^{-1})}$ $π\otimes{\rm JL}(π).$ This decomposition into irreducible representations of $G(\mathbb{A})\times {\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{A})$ recovers the full global Jacquet-Langlands correspondence.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 38 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we define three different notions of tensor products for Leibniz bimodules. The ``natural" tensor product of Leibniz bimodules is not always a Leibniz bimodule. In order to fix this, we introduce the notion of a weak Leibniz bimodule and show that the ``natural" tensor product of weak bimodules is again a weak bimodule. Moreover, it turns out that weak Leibniz bimodules are modules over a cocommutative Hopf algebra canonically associated to the Leibniz algebra. Therefore, the category of all weak Leibniz bimodules is symmetric monoidal and the full subcategory of finite-dimensional weak Leibniz bimodules is rigid and pivotal. On the other hand, we introduce two truncated tensor products of Leibniz bimodules which are again Leibniz bimodules. These tensor products induce a non-associative multiplication on the Grothendieck group of the category of finite-dimensional Leibniz bimodules. In particular, we prove that in characteristic zero for a finite-dimensional solvable Leibniz algebra this Grothendieck ring is an alternative power-associative commutative Jordan ring, but for a finite-dimensional non-zero semi-simple Leibniz algebra it is neither alternative nor a Jordan ring.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent work, we showed that for all $q\in\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}\setminus\mathbb{Z}_{\leq0}$, the sequence $\left\{Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(q\right)\right\}_{n\geq1}$ contains transcendental elements infinitely often. Employing methods from that analysis, we now find that for arbitrary fixed $m\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq1}$, the density of the set of transcendental $Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(m\right)$ for $n\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,N\right\}$ is bounded below by $β_{m}\left(N\right)=\max\left\{ 0,\sqrt{N-1}-3/2\right\}/N$, so that $β_{m}\left(N\right)\asymp N^{-1/2}\rightarrow0$ as $N\rightarrow\infty$. Fixing $n\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq2}$, we further provide a relatively strong upper bound (of $n-1$) on the number of algebraic $Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(m\right)$ for $m\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq1}$, and then show that this result implies that the density of the set of transcendental elements $Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(m\right)$ for $m\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,M\right\}$ has lower bound $β_{n}\left(M\right)=1-\min\left\{ n-1,M\right\}/M$, with $β_{n}\left(M\right)\asymp1-\left(n-1\right)/M\rightarrow1$ as $M\rightarrow\infty$. Finally, we evaluate the bivariate density of the set of transcendental $Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(m\right)$ for $\left(n,m\right)\in\left\{2,3,\ldots,N\right\}\times\left\{1,2,\ldots,M\right\}$, obtaining the lower bound $β\left(N,M\right)=\left(M-1\right)/\left[2\left(N-1\right)\right]$ if $M\leq N-1$, $=1-N/\left(2M\right)$ if $M>N-1$, which converges to 0 for $M/N\rightarrow0$, to 1/2 for $M/N\rightarrow1$, and to 1 for $M/N\rightarrow\infty$.</p></details>

As an application, we consider an explicit example of a rank three Nichols algebra from [41]. We show that it yields a standard Cartan graph and prove that it is, in fact, an affine Nichols algebra.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 54 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2024, Garvan, Sellers and Smoot discovered a remarkable symmetry in the families of congruences for generalized Frobenius partitions $cψ_{2,0}$ and $cψ_{2,1}$. They also emphasized that the considerations for the general case of $cψ_{k,β}$ are important for future work. In this paper, for each $k$ we construct a vector-valued modular form for the generating functions of $cψ_{k,β}$, and determine an equivalence relation among all $β$. Within each equivalence class, we can identify modular transformations relating the congruences of one $cψ_{k,β}$ to that of another $cψ_{k,β'}$. Furthermore, correspondences between different equivalence classes can also be obtained through linear combinations of modular transformations. As an example, with the aid of these correspondences, we prove a family of congruences of $cφ_{3}$, the Andrews' $3$-colored Frobenius partition.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the representations of the triplet group $L_n$, where $n$ is a positive integer, and its extensions to the virtual and welded triplet groups $VL_n$ and $WL_n$, respectively. We first introduce $L_n$, its extensions, and its pure subgroup. We then investigate several representations, proving the irreducibility of the classical Tits representation $Θ: L_n \to \mathrm{GL}_{n-1}(\mathbb{C})$ over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ and constructing a new representation $μ: L_n \to \mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{F}_n)$, where $\mathbb{F}_n$ is the free group of rank $n$. For the representation $μ$, we determine its matrix form, faithfulness, and irreducibility. We also classify all complex homogeneous $2$-local representations of $L_n$ for $n \ge 3$ and all non-homogeneous $2$-local representations of $L_3$, establishing connections with the complex specialization of the representation $μ$. Finally, we examine extensions of $L_n$ representations to $VL_n$ and $WL_n$, proving their existence, classifying non-trivial complex homogeneous $2$-local representations, and analyzing their faithfulness and irreducibility. The paper concludes with an open question regarding further extension of representation of $L_n$ to $VL_n$ and $WL_n$.</p></details>

The discrete Markov spectrum is defined in terms of the Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz.$ Using the tool called snake graphs, originating from cluster algebra theory, we first reconstruct proofs of its properties in a combinatorial framework and then extend it to the generalized setting. We then introduce the generalized discrete Markov spectrum, defined analogously via the generalized Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k_1 yz + k_2 zx + k_3 xy = (3 + k_1 + k_2 + k_3) xyz.$ We prove that this generalized spectrum is contained in the Markov-Lagrange spectrum and thus the Markov spectrum.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using the WZ method to prove supercongruences critically depends on an inspired WZ pair choice. This paper demonstrates a procedure for finding WZ pair candidates to prove a given supercongruence. When suitable WZ pairs are thus obtained, coupling them with the $p$-adic approximation of $Γ_p$ by Long and Ramakrishna enables uniform proofs for the Van Hamme supercongruences (B.2), (C.2), (D.2), (E.2), (F.2), (G.2), and (H.2). This approach also yields the known extensions of G.2 modulo $p^4$, and of H.2 modulo $p^3$ when $p$ is $3$ modulo $4$. Finally, the Van Hamme supercongruence (I.2) is shown to be a special case of the WZ method where Gosper's algorithm itself succeeds.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a finite group acting on a vector space $V = \mathbb{F}_p^n$ over a prime field. Given finite sets $S \subset G$ and $E \subset V$, we study the restricted orbit union $S(E) = \bigcup_{g\in S} g(E)$ and establish quantitative lower bounds for $|S(E)|$ in terms of $|S|$, $|E|$, and natural structural conditions. This finite field packing problem has connections to distance geometry, configuration counting, and expanding graphs. For $G = SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ acting on $\mathbb{F}_p^2$, we prove that $$|S(E)| \gg \min\left\lbrace p^2, \frac{|S||E|}{p^2}\right\rbrace,$$ which is sharp. Under geometric non-concentration conditions on $E$ and subgroup-avoidance hypotheses on $S$, we obtain a power-saving improvement of the form $$|S(E)|\gg \min \left\lbrace p^2, ~\max\left\lbrace\frac{|S||E|}{pk}, ~\frac{|S|^{\frac{1}{2}}|E|}{p^{\frac{1-ε}{2}}k^{\frac{1}{2}}}\right\rbrace \right\rbrace,$$ where $k$ bounds the radial multiplicity of $E$. For small sets $|E| \leq p$, we establish optimal bounds using weighted incidence theory. Analogous results are proved for the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_1(\mathbb{F}_p)$ acting on $\mathbb{F}_p^3$. Our approach reformulates the problem as an incidence question in a bipartite action graph. The proofs combine Fourier analytic techniques, energy estimates, point-line incidence bounds, and area-energy inequalities for skew dot products. The methods extend classical sum-product type problems and incidence theory to noncommutative group actions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study rings over which an analogue of the Weierstrass preparation theorem holds for power series. We show that a commutative ring $R$ admits a factorization of every power series in $R[[x]]$ as the product of a polynomial and a unit if and only if $R$ is isomorphic to a finite product of complete local principal ideal rings. We also characterize Noetherian rings $R$ for which this factorization holds under the weaker condition that the coefficients of the series generate the unit ideal: this occurs precisely when $R$ is isomorphic to a finite product of complete local Noetherian integral domains. Beyond this, we investigate the failure of Weierstrass-type preparation in finitely generated rings and prove a general transcendence result for zeros of $p$-adic power series, producing a large class of power series over number rings that cannot be written as a polynomial times a unit. Finally, we show that for a finitely generated infinite commutative ring $R$, the decision problem of determining whether an integer power series (with computable coefficients) factors as a polynomial times a unit in $R[[x]]$ is undecidable.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given an algebraically closed field $K$, a dynamical sequence over $K$ is a $K$-valued sequence of the form $a(n):= f(φ^n(x_0))$, where $φ\colon X\to X$ and $f\colon X\to\mathbb{A}^1$ are rational maps defined over $K$, and $x_0\in X$ is a point whose forward orbit avoids the indeterminacy loci of $\varphi$ and $f$. Many classical sequences from number theory and algebraic combinatorics fall under this dynamical framework, and we show that the class of dynamical sequences enjoys numerous closure properties and encompasses all elliptic divisibility sequences, all Somos sequences, and all $C^n$- and $D^n$-finite sequences for all $n\ge 1$, as defined by Jiménez-Pastor, Nuspl, and Pillwein. We also give an algorithm for proving that two dynamical sequences are identical and illustrate how to use this algorithm by showing how to prove several classical combinatorial identities via this method.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Submitted to Acta Arithmetica

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Our work is motivated by the fact that the norms of the Eulerian integers are related to the sums of form $a^2-ab+b^2$, providing a natural generalization for problems concerning products over sums or differences of integers. Let $E$ be the set of Eulerian integers. We define $ω_{\mathbb N}(x)$ as the number of distinct prime divisors of $x\in\mathbb N$, and $ω_E(x)$ as the number of distinct Euler prime divisors of $x\in E$. By the Erdős--Turán theorem, if $\mc A\subset\mathbb Z^{+}$ and $|\mathcal{A}|=3\cdot{2^{k-1}}$ ($k\in\mathbb{Z}^+$), then $ω_\mathbb{N}(\prod_{a,b\in\mathcal{A},a\neq{b}}(a+b))\geq{k+1}$. We prove that if $\mathcal{A} \subset E$ is a finite set and $ρ\in E$, then the value of $ω_E(\prod_{a,b \in \mathcal{A}, a \neq b}(a+ρb))$ has a lower bound of order $\log|\mathcal{A}|$. Consequently, we provide lower bounds for $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathbb{N}$ for both $ω_{\mathbb{N}}(\prod_{a,b \in \mathcal{A}, a \neq b}(a^2+ab+b^2))$ and $ω_{\mathbb{N}}(\prod_{a,b \in \mathcal{A}, a \neq b}(a^2-ab+b^2))$. We also give an upper bound for the minimum of $ω_{\mathbb{N}}(\prod_{a,b \in \mathcal{A}, a \neq b}(a^2+ab+b^2))$ with a computer program, if $|\mathcal{A}|\le 8$ and sets whose largest element is relatively small. Furthermore, using a Diophantine number theoretical lemma of Győry, Sárközy, and Stewart, we give a lower bound of order $\log|\mathcal{A}|$ for $ω_{\mathbb{N}}(\prod_{a \in \mathcal{A}, b \in \mathcal{B}}(f(a,b)))$ for a specific class of polynomials $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x,y]$ and finite sets $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B} \subset \mathbb{Z}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1908, Voronoi introduced an algorithm that solves the lattice packing problem in any dimension in finite time. Voronoi showed that any lattice with optimal packing density must be a so-called perfect lattice, and his algorithm enumerates the finitely many perfect lattices up to similarity in a fixed dimension. However, due to the high complexity of the algorithm this enumeration had, until now, only been completed up to dimension 8. In this work we compute all 2237251040 perfect lattices in dimension 9 via Voronoi's algorithm. As a corollary, this shows that the laminated lattice $Λ_9$ gives the densest lattice packing in dimension 9. Equivalently, we show that the Hermite constant $γ_9$ in dimension 9 equals $2$. Furthermore, we extend a result by Watson (1971) and show that the set of possible kissing numbers in dimension 9 is precisely $2 \cdot \{ 1, \ldots, 91, 99, 120, \ldots, 129, 136 \}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In twisted Diophantine approximation, for a fixed $m\times n$ matrix $\boldsymbolα$ one is interested in sets of vectors $\boldsymbolβ\in\mathbb R^m$ such that the system of affine forms $\mathbb R^n \ni \mathbf q \mapsto \boldsymbolα\mathbf q + \boldsymbolβ\in \mathbb R^m$ satisfies some given Diophantine condition. In this paper we introduce the notion of manifolds which are of $\boldsymbolα$-twisted Khintchine type for convergence or divergence. We provide sufficient conditions under which nondegenerate analytic manifolds exhibit this twisted Khintchine-type behaviour. Furthermore, we investigate the intersection properties of the sets of $\boldsymbolα$-twisted badly approximable and well approximable vectors with nondegenerate manifolds.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We represent the Riemann zeta function in the half-plane $\Re s >1$ via series whose terms admit geometrically decreasing bounds. Due to an underlying recurrence relation, which is used to compute coefficients entering into the terms, the cost is probably at least quadratic in the number of terms. And the number of terms needed to reach a given fixed-point precision grows linearly with the imaginary part, so, presumably, the usefulness is limited to small imaginary parts (up to the hundreds perhaps). The method is a development of tools introduced by the author for the evaluation of harmonic series with restricted digits in a given radix.</p></details>

This construction makes use of symmetric tensors in the symmetric tensor category of dg $A$-modules and does not require a Noetherian assumption on $A$. Moreover, the resolution has many lifting properties which we leverage to study the homotopy Lie algebra associated to the pair $(A,A/I)$, which is defined as the cohomology of the PD derivations of this PD dg algebra. Finally we investigate the complete intersection case in more details as well as connect it to the finite generation of the Yoneda algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Gosper developed an algorithm for performing arithmetic on continued fractions (CFs), and introduced continued logarithms (CLs) as a variant of continued fractions better suited to representing extremely large (or small) numbers. CLs are also well-suited to efficient hardware implementation. Here we present the algorithm for arithmetic on CLs, then extend it to the novel contribution of this paper, an algorithm for computing trigonometric, exponential, and log functions on CLs. These methods can be extended to other transcendental functions. As with the corresponding CF algorithms, computations are entirely in the domain of the CL representation, with no floating-point arithmetic; we read one CL input term at a time, producing the next CL term of the result as soon as it is determined. The CL algorithms are in fact simpler than their CF counterparts. We have implemented these algorithms in Haskell.</p></details>

Distinct from previous strategies by Cornut and Vatsal that relied on Ratner's theorems on unipotent flows and required restrictive hypotheses on level structures, our approach circumvents these constraints by exploiting the interplay between Galois orbits and Hecke orbits. By quantifying the relative size of these orbits, we reduce the problem to ergodic results concerning the equidistribution of Hecke operators and the classification of joining measures. This method allows for the analysis of simultaneous supersingular reductions without requiring the surjectivity of reduction maps.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Starting from an Enriques surface over $\mathbb{Q}(t)$ considered by Lafon, we give the first examples of smooth projective weakly special threefolds which fibre over the projective line in Enriques surfaces (resp. K3 surfaces) with nowhere reduced, but non-divisible, fibres and general type orbifold base. We verify that these families of Enriques surfaces (resp. K3 surfaces) are non-isotrivial and compute their fundamental groups by studying the behaviour of local points along certain étale covers. The existence of the above threefolds implies that the Weakly Special Conjecture formulated in 2000 contradicts the Orbifold Mordell Conjecture, and hence the abc conjecture. Using these examples, we can also easily disprove several complex-analytic analogues of the Weakly Special Conjecture. Finally, the existence of such threefolds shows that Enriques surfaces and K3 surfaces can have non-divisible but nowhere reduced degenerations, thereby answering a question raised in 2005.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We examine the distribution of zeroes of half-integral weight Hecke cusp forms on the manifold $Γ_0(4)\backslash\mathbb H$ near a cusp at infinity. In analogue of the Ghosh-Sarnak conjecture for classical holomorphic Hecke cusp forms, one expects that almost all of the zeroes sufficiently close to this cusp lie on two vertical geodesics $\Re(s)=-1/2$ and $\Re(s)=0$ as the weight tends to infinity. We show that, for $\gg_\varepsilon K^2/(\log K)^{3/2+\varepsilon}$ of the half-integral weight Hecke cusp forms in the Kohnen plus subspaces with weight bounded by a large constant $K$, the number of such "real" zeroes grows almost at the expected rate. We also obtain a weaker lower bound for the number of real zeroes that holds for a positive proportion of forms. One of the key ingredients is the asymptotic evaluation of averaged first and second moments of quadratic twists of modular $L$-functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>When do two irreducible polynomials with integer coefficients define the same number field? One can define an action of $\mathrm{GL}_2 \times \mathrm{GL}_1$ on the space of polynomials of degree $n$ so that for any two polynomials $f$ and $g$ in the same orbit, the roots of $f$ may be expressed as rational linear transformations of the roots of $g$; thus, they generate the same field. In this article, we show that almost all polynomials of degree $n$ with size at most $X$ can only define the same number field as another polynomial of degree $n$ with size at most $X$ if they lie in the same orbit for this group action. (Here we measure the size of polynomials by the greatest absolute value of their coefficients.) This improves on work of Bhargava, Shankar, and Wang, who proved a similar statement for a positive proportion of polynomials. Using this result, we prove that the number of degree $n$ fields such that the smallest polynomial defining the field has size at most $X$ is asymptotic to a constant times $X^{n+1}$ as long as $n\geq 3$. For $n = 2$, we obtain a precise asymptotic of the form $\frac{27}{π^2} X^2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2001, Bhargava proved a composition law for $2 \times 2 \times 2$ integer cubes, which generalized Gauss composition of integral binary quadratic forms. Furthermore, he derived four new composition laws defined on the following spaces: 1) binary cubic forms with triplicate middle coefficients, 2) pairs of binary quadratic forms with duplicate middle coefficients, 3) pairs of quaternary alternating 2-forms and 4) senary alternating 3-forms. In each of the five cases, there is a natural group action on the underlying space with a unique polynomial invariant called the discriminant, and a notion of projectivity for the elements of the space. The strategy behind Bhargava's approach is to construct a discriminant-preserving bijection between the set of orbits under the group action and the set of (tuples of) suitable ideal classes of quadratic rings. The projective ideal classes are equipped with a natural group structure and hence we get a group structure on the spaces of equivalence classes of projective forms of fixed discriminant $D$. In each case the class group of projective forms of discriminant $D$ has a natural interpretation in terms of the narrow class group of the quadratic ring of discriminant $D$. The aim of this paper is to give explicit composition identities (similar to Gauss' formulation of composition of binary quadratic forms) for these higher composition laws.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The integer convex hull $I(H_N)$ of the set $H_N=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2: xy\ge N\}$ is the convex hull of the lattice points in $H_N$. The vertices of $I(H_N)$ lie in the square $[1,N]^2$. Improving on a recent result of Alcántara et al. ~\cite{Santos} we show that the number of vertices of $I(H_N)$ is of order $N^{1/3}\log N$. We also show that the area of the part of $H_N \setminus I(H_N)$ that lies in the square $[1,N^{2/3}]^2$ is also of order $N^{1/3}\log N$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish an ideal-theoretic rigidity principle for quadratic distance images over integer residue rings. Specifically, we prove that near-extremal collapse of the distance set in $\mathbb{Z}_n^d$ forces strong algebraic structure supported on annihilator submodules arising from the arithmetic of $n$. As a consequence, we obtain the first inverse theorem for the Falconer distance problem over $\mathbb{Z}_n$ for composite moduli. We show that if a set $E \subset \mathbb{Z}_n^d$ of size $|E| \asymp n^{(d+1)/2}$ determines only $O(n)$ distinct squared distances, then $E$ must be supported on a coset of an annihilator submodule on which the distance form is algebraically degenerate. The proof introduces a divisor-depth decomposition intrinsic to $\mathbb{Z}_n$, together with a lifting mechanism that transfers local degeneracies at prime moduli into global ideal-theoretic constraints. This yields a complete classification of near-extremizers for the Falconer distance problem in the ring setting, revealing a rigidity phenomenon with no analogue over fields.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Amir Mostaed &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper establishes an explicit obstruction to constructing algebraic cycles from automorphic cohomology classes on Shimura varieties. We produce a rational Hodge class $Ω_E$ in the intersection cohomology of the Baily-Borel compactification of a Shimura variety for $\text{SO}(2,26)$, arising from a stable residual automorphic representation via theta lift from the weight-$2$ newform of conductor $11$. While $Ω_E$ is automorphic and of pure Hodge type, we prove it is non-interior and hence cannot be obtained from special cycles, theta lifts, endoscopic transfers, or boundary pushforwards, all of which yield interior classes. The result is unconditional, relying only on Arthur's classification, Vogan-Zuckerman theory, the fundamental lemma, and the Zucker conjecture (proven by Looijenga-Saper-Stern), and it highlights a fundamental asymmetry between automorphic cohomology and geometric access to algebraic cycles, refining the Hodge conjecture from a question of existence to one of constructive tractability.</p></details>

> **Comment:** After we posted the first version on arXiv, we learned from K. Soundararajan that the result in this paper was previously obtained by Mirsky in 1947. We mistakenly assumed that the 2024 paper of Miller et al. represented the status of this problem. Their paper makes no reference to Mirsky; his work seems to have been forgotten. This manuscript will not be submitted for journal publication

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study "dead ends" in square-free digit walks: square-free integers $N$ such that, in base $b$, every one-digit extension $bN+d$ is non-square-free. In base $10$, the stochastic independence model of Miller et al. suggests that infinite square-free walks occur with probability near $1$, corresponding to an asymptotic dead-end density of $\approx 5.218\times 10^{-5}$. We prove that the true asymptotic dead-end density satisfies $$ c_{\mathrm{dead}} \approx 1.317\times 10^{-9}, $$ roughly a factor of $\sim 4\times 10^4$ smaller than the prediction. For every base $b\geq 2$, we prove that dead-end densities exist and are given by a closed-form expression (as a finite alternating sum of Euler products). The argument is fully formalized in Lean/Mathlib, and was produced automatically by AxiomProver from a natural-language statement of the problem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give an algebraic construction of shift operators for the non-symmetric Heckman-Opdam polynomials and the non-symmetric Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials. To each linear character of the finite Weyl group, we associate forward and backward shift operators, which are differential-reflection and difference-reflection operators that satisfy certain transmutation relations with the (Dunkl-)Cherednik operators. In the Heckman-Opdam case, the construction recovers the non-symmetric shift operators of Opdam and Toledano Laredo for the sign character. Furthermore, in rank one, we recover the rank-one non-symmetric shift operators previously obtained by the authors and Schlösser.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the derived Picard groups of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of surfaces in the sense of Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich and the related graded gentle algebras. This includes the wrapped cases as introduced by Bocklandt. An important ingredient for our proof in characteristic zero is the exponential map from Hochschild cohomology to the derived Picard group introduced in recent work by the author. In positive characteristics, we combine deformation theory and formality results for Hochschild complexes to prove our results. Along the way we show that the surface together with its decorations forms a complete derived invariant of partially wrapped Fukaya categories and we prove analogous results for graded gentle algebras. This removes all previous restrictions from earlier results of this kind.</p></details>
