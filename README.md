 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jesse Jääsaari &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We examine the distribution of zeroes of half-integral weight Hecke cusp forms on the manifold $Γ_0(4)\backslash\mathbb H$ near a cusp at infinity. In analogue of the Ghosh-Sarnak conjecture for classical holomorphic Hecke cusp forms, one expects that almost all of the zeroes sufficiently close to this cusp lie on two vertical geodesics $\Re(s)=-1/2$ and $\Re(s)=0$ as the weight tends to infinity. We show that, for $\gg_\varepsilon K^2/(\log K)^{3/2+\varepsilon}$ of the half-integral weight Hecke cusp forms in the Kohnen plus subspaces with weight bounded by a large constant $K$, the number of such "real" zeroes grows almost at the expected rate. We also obtain a weaker lower bound for the number of real zeroes that holds for a positive proportion of forms. One of the key ingredients is the asymptotic evaluation of averaged first and second moments of quadratic twists of modular $L$-functions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ryan C. Chen, Natalia Garcia-Fritz, Siddharth Mathur, Hector Pasten &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Towards the Lang--Vojta conjecture, we prove results on finiteness and Zariski degeneracy of $S$-integral points of varieties over number fields $k$, including many cases with geometrically irreducible boundary divisors. Our approach builds on the study of arithmetic and geometric properties of moduli spaces of curves with extra structure. As an application, we provide families of explicit examples of geometrically irreducible divisors on the projective plane (such as the dual of any smooth curve of degree at least $3$), with respect to which the sets of $S$-integral points are finite. Answering a question of Achenjang and Morrow, we show that, other than the case of curves, every normal projective variety admits a geometrically irreducible divisor $D$ for which finiteness of $(D,S)$-integral points holds over every finite extension of $k$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>When do two irreducible polynomials with integer coefficients define the same number field? One can define an action of $\mathrm{GL}_2 \times \mathrm{GL}_1$ on the space of polynomials of degree $n$ so that for any two polynomials $f$ and $g$ in the same orbit, the roots of $f$ may be expressed as rational linear transformations of the roots of $g$; thus, they generate the same field. In this article, we show that almost all polynomials of degree $n$ with size at most $X$ can only define the same number field as another polynomial of degree $n$ with size at most $X$ if they lie in the same orbit for this group action. (Here we measure the size of polynomials by the greatest absolute value of their coefficients.) This improves on work of Bhargava, Shankar, and Wang, who proved a similar statement for a positive proportion of polynomials. Using this result, we prove that the number of degree $n$ fields such that the smallest polynomial defining the field has size at most $X$ is asymptotic to a constant times $X^{n+1}$ as long as $n\geq 3$. For $n = 2$, we obtain a precise asymptotic of the form $\frac{27}{π^2} X^2$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ernie Croot, Chi Hoi Yip &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 27 pages, revised based on referee comments

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k\geq 2$ and $n\neq 0$. A Diophantine tuple with property $D_k(n)$ is a set of positive integers $A$ such that $ab+n$ is a $k$-th power for all $a,b\in A$ with $a\neq b$. Such generalizations of classical Diophantine tuples have been studied extensively. In this paper, we prove several results related to robust versions of such Diophantine tuples and discuss their applications to product sets contained in a nontrivial shift of the set of all perfect powers or some of its special subsets. In particular, we substantially improve several results by Bérczes--Dujella--Hajdu--Luca, and Yip. We also prove several interesting conditional results. Our proofs are based on a novel combination of ideas from sieve methods, Diophantine approximation, and extremal graph theory.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gautam Chinta, Ajith Nair &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 35 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2001, Bhargava proved a composition law for $2 \times 2 \times 2$ integer cubes, which generalized Gauss composition of integral binary quadratic forms. Furthermore, he derived four new composition laws defined on the following spaces: 1) binary cubic forms with triplicate middle coefficients, 2) pairs of binary quadratic forms with duplicate middle coefficients, 3) pairs of quaternary alternating 2-forms and 4) senary alternating 3-forms. In each of the five cases, there is a natural group action on the underlying space with a unique polynomial invariant called the discriminant, and a notion of projectivity for the elements of the space. The strategy behind Bhargava's approach is to construct a discriminant-preserving bijection between the set of orbits under the group action and the set of (tuples of) suitable ideal classes of quadratic rings. The projective ideal classes are equipped with a natural group structure and hence we get a group structure on the spaces of equivalence classes of projective forms of fixed discriminant $D$. In each case the class group of projective forms of discriminant $D$ has a natural interpretation in terms of the narrow class group of the quadratic ring of discriminant $D$. The aim of this paper is to give explicit composition identities (similar to Gauss' formulation of composition of binary quadratic forms) for these higher composition laws.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The integer convex hull $I(H_N)$ of the set $H_N=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2: xy\ge N\}$ is the convex hull of the lattice points in $H_N$. The vertices of $I(H_N)$ lie in the square $[1,N]^2$. Improving on a recent result of Alcántara et al. ~\cite{Santos} we show that the number of vertices of $I(H_N)$ is of order $N^{1/3}\log N$. We also show that the area of the part of $H_N \setminus I(H_N)$ that lies in the square $[1,N^{2/3}]^2$ is also of order $N^{1/3}\log N$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Shalender Singh, Vishnupriya Singh &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 16 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish an ideal-theoretic rigidity principle for quadratic distance images over integer residue rings. Specifically, we prove that near-extremal collapse of the distance set in $\mathbb{Z}_n^d$ forces strong algebraic structure supported on annihilator submodules arising from the arithmetic of $n$. As a consequence, we obtain the first inverse theorem for the Falconer distance problem over $\mathbb{Z}_n$ for composite moduli. We show that if a set $E \subset \mathbb{Z}_n^d$ of size $|E| \asymp n^{(d+1)/2}$ determines only $O(n)$ distinct squared distances, then $E$ must be supported on a coset of an annihilator submodule on which the distance form is algebraically degenerate. The proof introduces a divisor-depth decomposition intrinsic to $\mathbb{Z}_n$, together with a lifting mechanism that transfers local degeneracies at prime moduli into global ideal-theoretic constraints. This yields a complete classification of near-extremizers for the Falconer distance problem in the ring setting, revealing a rigidity phenomenon with no analogue over fields.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06865v1'>2602.06865</a>\]&nbsp; **Automorphic Cohomology and the Limits of Algebraic Cycles**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Amir Mostaed &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper establishes an explicit obstruction to constructing algebraic cycles from automorphic cohomology classes on Shimura varieties. We produce a rational Hodge class $Ω_E$ in the intersection cohomology of the Baily-Borel compactification of a Shimura variety for $\text{SO}(2,26)$, arising from a stable residual automorphic representation via theta lift from the weight-$2$ newform of conductor $11$. While $Ω_E$ is automorphic and of pure Hodge type, we prove it is non-interior and hence cannot be obtained from special cycles, theta lifts, endoscopic transfers, or boundary pushforwards, all of which yield interior classes. The result is unconditional, relying only on Arthur's classification, Vogan-Zuckerman theory, the fundamental lemma, and the Zucker conjecture (proven by Looijenga-Saper-Stern), and it highlights a fundamental asymmetry between automorphic cohomology and geometric access to algebraic cycles, refining the Hodge conjecture from a question of existence to one of constructive tractability.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Evan Chen, Chris Cummins, Ben Eltschig, Dejan Grubisic, Leopold Haller, Letong Hong, Andranik Kurghinyan, Kenny Lau, Hugh Leather, Seewoo Lee, Aram Markosyan, Ken Ono, Manooshree Patel, Gaurang Pendharkar, Vedant Rathi, Alex Schneidman, Volker Seeker, Shubho Sengupta, Ishan Sinha, Jimmy Xin, Jujian Zhang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** After we posted the first version on arXiv, we learned from K. Soundararajan that the result in this paper was previously obtained by Mirsky in 1947. We mistakenly assumed that the 2024 paper of Miller et al. represented the status of this problem. Their paper makes no reference to Mirsky; his work seems to have been forgotten. This manuscript will not be submitted for journal publication

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study "dead ends" in square-free digit walks: square-free integers $N$ such that, in base $b$, every one-digit extension $bN+d$ is non-square-free. In base $10$, the stochastic independence model of Miller et al. suggests that infinite square-free walks occur with probability near $1$, corresponding to an asymptotic dead-end density of $\approx 5.218\times 10^{-5}$. We prove that the true asymptotic dead-end density satisfies $$ c_{\mathrm{dead}} \approx 1.317\times 10^{-9}, $$ roughly a factor of $\sim 4\times 10^4$ smaller than the prediction. For every base $b\geq 2$, we prove that dead-end densities exist and are given by a closed-form expression (as a finite alternating sum of Euler products). The argument is fully formalized in Lean/Mathlib, and was produced automatically by AxiomProver from a natural-language statement of the problem.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Max van Horssen, Maarten van Pruijssen &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 31 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give an algebraic construction of shift operators for the non-symmetric Heckman-Opdam polynomials and the non-symmetric Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials. To each linear character of the finite Weyl group, we associate forward and backward shift operators, which are differential-reflection and difference-reflection operators that satisfy certain transmutation relations with the (Dunkl-)Cherednik operators. In the Heckman-Opdam case, the construction recovers the non-symmetric shift operators of Opdam and Toledano Laredo for the sign character. Furthermore, in rank one, we recover the rank-one non-symmetric shift operators previously obtained by the authors and Schlösser.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sebastian Opper &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 42 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the derived Picard groups of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of surfaces in the sense of Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich and the related graded gentle algebras. This includes the wrapped cases as introduced by Bocklandt. An important ingredient for our proof in characteristic zero is the exponential map from Hochschild cohomology to the derived Picard group introduced in recent work by the author. In positive characteristics, we combine deformation theory and formality results for Hochschild complexes to prove our results. Along the way we show that the surface together with its decorations forms a complete derived invariant of partially wrapped Fukaya categories and we prove analogous results for graded gentle algebras. This removes all previous restrictions from earlier results of this kind.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $Ψ(x,y)$ denote the count of $y$-smooth numbers below $x$ and $P(n)$ denote the largest prime factor of $n$. We prove that for $f$ a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, the partial sums over $y$-smooth numbers always enjoy better than squareroot cancellation, in the sense that $$ \mathbb{E} \Big|\sum_{\substack{1\leq n \leq x\\ P(n) \leq y}} f(n) \Big| = o\left( Ψ(x,y)^{1/2} \right),$$ uniformly on the entire range $ 2 \leq y \leq x$. The bounds are quantitative and give a large saving when $y$ isn't too close to $x$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v4: Further added new statements e.g., Theorem 6.16 (on existence of $\mathbb{H}^*$-action, SU(2)-action, corresponding log K-polystability/Kahler-Einstein metric existence of contact orbifolds, weights of symplectic forms, etc). Also minor changes of expositions

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that any symplectic singularity lying on a smoothable projective symplectic variety locally admits a good action of $(\mathbb{C}^*)^r$, which is canonical. Under mild assumptions, we actually prove such singularity germ is the cone vertex over a contact orbifold with weak Kähler-Einstein metric, forcing $r=1$. In particular, it admits a (canonical) good $\mathbb{C}^*$-action, which also extends to (canonical) actions of $\mathbb{H}^*\supset SU(2)$. These settle Kaledin's conjecture conditionally but in a substantially stronger form by establishing the canonicity, the extensibility of the action, for instance. Our key idea is to use the Donaldson-Sun theory on local Kähler metrics in complex differential geometry to connect with the theory of Poisson deformations of symplectic varieties. For general symplectic singularities, we prove the same assertions, assuming that the Donaldson-Sun theory extends to such singularities along with suitable singular (hyper)Kähler metrics. Conversely, our results can also be used to study the local behavior of such metrics around the germ.</p></details>

In particular, we obtain exponential lower bounds for the largest prime ideal divisor and norm of the radical of the principal ideal generated by $U_n(ζ)$. We further derive an effective upper bound for the $S$-part of $U_n(ζ)$, showing that it is strictly smaller than a fixed power of its absolute norm for sufficiently large $n$. Finally, we establish an effective finiteness result for Diophantine equations of the form $U_n(ζ)=w_1+\cdots+w_r,$ with $S$-unit variables.</p></details>

> **Comment:** En langue française. in French language

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the spirit of Arthur's trace formula, we establish a general trace formula for symmetric spaces associated with the variety of involutions of a finite $D$-module where $D$ is a division algebra central over a number field $F$. Such a formula should be useful for studying the automorphic spectrum of these symmetric spaces and the deep links between linear periods and special values of standard $L$-functions at their center of symmetry. Indeed, our formula yields an identity between spectral distributions, which generalize relative characters built on linear periods, and geometric distributions, which are an extension of relative orbital integrals. We show that the spectral distributions are, in a certain sense, asymptotic to truncated integrals of the components of the automorphic kernel associated with a cuspidal datum: this provides a handle on these distributions and has allowed, in a companion paper, to express some of these distributions in the form of a weighted relative character. The geometric distributions attached to "regular semi-simple" geometric data are expressed as weighted relative orbital integrals. In general, for non-regular geometric data, we introduce a procedure of descent to the centralizer, which allows us to express any geometric distribution in terms of the nilpotent contribution of infinitesimal trace formulas studied in previous papers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is the second paper in a series where we study arithmetic applications of the multiple elliptic Gamma functions originated in mathematical physics. In the first article in this series we defined geometric families of these functions and proved that these families satisfied coboundary relations involving an attached collection of Bernoulli rational functions. The main purpose of the present paper is to show that smoothed versions of our geometric elliptic Gamma functions give rise to partial modular symbols for congruence subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}_{n}(\mathbb{Z})$ for $n \geq 2$ which restrict to $(n-2)$-cocycles on tori in $\mathrm{SL}_{n}(\mathbb{Z})$ coming from groups of totally positive units in number fields. To achieve this, we show that the associated smoothed Bernoulli rational functions reduce to smoothed higher Dedekind sums with uniformly bounded denominators.</p></details>

Then, for genuine representations of $p$-adic covering groups we formulate an upper bound conjecture for their wavefront sets using this covering Barbasch-Vogan duality and reduce it to anti-discrete representations. The formulation generalizes that of Ciubotaru-Kim and Hazeltine-Liu-Lo-Shahidi for linear algebraic groups.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Quasi-hereditary algebras were introduced by Cline, Parshall and Scott to describe the highest weight categories of representations of semisimple Lie algebras and algebraic groups by the module categories of finite-dimensional algebras. Since then a lot of homological, structural and categorical properties of quasi-hereditary algebras have been discovered. This class of algebras seems quite common and occurs in many branches of mathematics. There are lots of important works on the subject. In this note we mainly survey some of Claus Michael Ringel's works or works jointly with his collaborators on quasi-hereditary algebras. Also, some of related works and recent developments on quasi-hereditary algebras are mentioned.</p></details>

This result resolves a conjecture of Gorsky--Mazin--Vazirani and Wilson, establishing that the elliptic Hall algebra governs the Khovanov--Rozansky homology of torus links $T(km,kn)$. Consequently, this provides an affirmative answer to a question of Galashin and Lam in the torus link case. As a key step in the proof, we develop a rational analogue of the Shareshian--Wachs involution originally introduced to prove the symmetry property of the chromatic quasisymmetric functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Due to their deep connection with the Riemann zeta function, the asymptotic behavior of mean values of multiple zeta functions has attracted considerable attention. In this paper, we establish asymptotic formulas and upper bounds for the mean square values of Hurwitz-type and Barnes-type multiple zeta functions. In particular, we focus on the Hurwitz-type case, since Hurwitz multiple zeta functions can be expressed as linear combinations of the classical Hurwitz zeta function, which allows us to apply known results on the mean values and asymptotic behavior of the latter almost directly. Moreover, it can be shown that Hurwitz-type and Barnes-type multiple zeta functions have the same order under certain conditions. This fact enables us to investigate the mean values and growth of Barnes multiple zeta functions, which are otherwise difficult to evaluate, by using the results for Hurwitz multiple zeta functions.</p></details>

We show that the integral unfolds to a non-unique model and analyze it using the New Way method of Piatetski-Shapiro and Rallis. Two applications are given. First, we relate the existence of the poles of $L^S(s,π\timesτ)$ to the non-vanishing of certain period integrals. Second, for certain family of cuspidal representations, we prove that $L^S(s, π\times τ)$ is holomorphic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper aims to develop a grafting method to address Majid's conjecture, which enables the construction of a larger target quantum group by grafting two given smaller ones. This method is significant for advancing the understanding of the generation, classification, and construction of (quasi-)Hopf algebras. To pave the way for the grafting method, we first set up a multi-tensor product theory for generalized double-bosonization to acquire the necessary information on the braiding $R$-matrices (see \cite{HH2}). Beyond the perspective of braided monoidal categories arising from the representations of quantum subgroups, the grafting procedure necessitates incorporating structural information from root systems in Lie theory. This approach provides a one-stop strategy for resolving the generation problem in Majid's conjecture on quantum trees.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $Γ$ be a Bianchi group associated to one of the five Euclidean imaginary quadratic fields. We show that the space of weight $k$ period polynomials for $Γ$ is ``dual'' to the space of weight $k$ modular symbols for $Γ$, reflecting the duality between the first and second cohomology groups of Bianchi groups. Using this result, we describe the action of Hecke operators on the space of period polynomials for $Γ$ via the Heilbronn matrices. In the second part of the paper, we numerically investigate congruences between level 1 Bianchi eigenforms via computer programs which implement the Hecke action on spaces of Bianchi period polynomials. Computations with the Hecke action are used to indicate moduli of congruences between the underlying Bianchi forms; we then prove the congruences using the period polynomials. From this we find congruences between genuine Bianchi modular forms and both a base-change Bianchi form and an Eisenstein series. We believe these congruences are the first of their kind in the literature.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 14 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1977, Lenstra provided a criterion for norm-Euclideanity of number fields and noted that this criterion becomes ineffective for number fields of large enough degrees under the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) for the Dedekind zeta-functions. In the first part of the paper we make Lenstra's observation explicit by proving that, under GRH, the criterion becomes ineffective for all number fields of degree $n \geq 62238$. This follows from combining the criterion assumption with the explicit lower bound for the discriminant of $K$ under GRH, and the (trivial) upper bound for the minimal proper ideal norm in $\mathcal{O}_K$. Unconditionally, the lower bound for the discriminant is too weak to lead to such a contradiction. However, we show that GRH can be replaced by another condition on the Dedekind zeta functions $ζ_K$, a conjectural lower bound for $ζ_K$ at a point to the right of $s = 1$. Combined with Zimmert's approach, this condition implies a different type of upper bound for the minimal proper ideal norm and again contradicts Lenstra's criterion for all $n$ large enough. The advantage of the new potential condition on $ζ_K$ is that it can be computationally checked for number fields of not too large degrees.</p></details>

Garland's theorem for simple groups over non-archimedean fields provides the first examples of a higher Kazhdan property. We prove a version of Garland's theorem for simple Lie groups and their lattices. We generalize theorems of Borel and Borel-Yang about the invariance of the cohomology of lattices in semisimple Lie groups and adelic groups by improving the stability range and allowing for arbitrary unitary representations as coefficients. A novelty of our approach is the use of methods from geometric group theory and -- in the case of rank 1 -- from Clozel's work on the spectral gap property.</p></details>

Under this property the classical theory and its applications generalize nicely and we prove that rationally generated cones possess this IR property. For contrast, we give a detailed example of a simple cone without the IR property, showing various differences to the classical case. Moreover, this example yields connections to questions of number theory, in particular to Diophantine approximation and the Pell Equation. Finally, as an application, we give inner and outer polyhedral approximations for the generalized completely positive cone and a method to find rational certificates for (non-)membership in this cone.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Brocard-Ramanujan problem pertaining to the diophantine equation $n!+1=m^2$, a famously unsolved problem, deals with finding the integer solutions to the equation. Nobody has discovered any new solution of the problem beyond $n=4,~5$ and $7$ although many of us have tried it. Bruce Berndt and William Galway \cite{Berndt} had not found any new solution in 2000 by extensive computer search for a solution with $n$ up to $10^9$. The purpose of this study is to show that the solutions should satisfy some necessary and/or sufficient conditions. If $\sqrt{n!}=k+ε,~n>1,~0<ε<1$; then it has solution if and only if $n!=k(k+2)$ and $ε,~k$ are strictly monotonic increasing. It has only finitely many solutions which is not based on any conjecture or previous research on the Brocard-Ramanujan problem. For the new solution of Brocard-Ramanujan problem ($n\ge 10^5$), the value of $ε$ should be more than $0.999 \cdots 905915$ (digit 0 is coming after 228287 numbers of 9 digit, which takes more than 66 pages in (LibreOffice Writer) indicating almost impossibility of new solution. If we consider $n\geq 10^9$, I am unable to calculate the said numbers of 9 digit in the value of $ε$ in my personal laptop (with 8GB Ram) using MATHEMATICA 8. Finally, it has been claimed to discover that the problem has no further solution.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study families of analytic $p$-divisible groups over adic spaces $S$ defined over $\mathbb{Q}_p$. We prove an equivalence between such families and Hodge-Tate triples, generalizing a theorem of Fargues. For a perfectoid space $S$, we construct a functor associating to an analytic $p$-divisible group $\mathcal{G} \rightarrow S$ a coherent sheaf $\mathcal{E}(\mathcal{G})$ on the relative Fargues--Fontaine curve $X_S$. Restricting to analytic $p$-divisible groups admitting a Cartier dual, we obtain an equivalence of categories with local shtukas satisfying a minuscule condition, compatible with the prismatic Dieudonné theory of Anschütz--Le Bras. We conclude with applications to moduli spaces: we show that the local Shimura varieties of EL and PEL types of Scholze--Weinstein are moduli spaces of analytic $p$-divisible groups with extra structure, and we give a reinterpretation of the Hodge--Tate period map of Scholze in terms of topologically $p$-torsion subgroups of abelian varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the diagonal F-thresholds of determinantal hypersurfaces arising from a generic matrix and from a generic symmetric matrix, as well as of the Pfaffian hypersurface arising from a generic skew-symmetric matrix of even size. The main ingredient is a cohomology vanishing theorem for certain line bundles on flag varieties in characteristic $p$. In the cases of the generic matrix and the generic skew-symmetric matrix, we show that the diagonal F-threshold attains its minimal possible value, namely the negative of the a-invariant. The symmetric case is more subtle and relies in addition on a polynomiality result for representations afforded by cohomology, building on work of the second author with VandeBogert.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We denote by $P^+(n)$ the largest prime factor of the integer $n$. In 1935, Erd\H os studied the quantity $T_c(x)$ defined by $$ T_c(x)=\big|\big\{p\le x: P^+(p-1)\ge p^c\big\}\big|, $$ and he proved $$ \limsup_{x\rightarrow \infty}\frac{T_c(x)}{π(x)}\rightarrow 0, \quad \text{as~}c\rightarrow 1. $$ Recently, Ding gave a quantitative form of Erd\H os' result, showing that $$ \limsup_{x\rightarrow \infty}\frac{T_c(x)}{π(x)}\le 8\big(c^{-1}-1\big). $$ holds for $8/9< c<1$. In this paper, we improve Ding's upper bound to $$ \limsup_{x\rightarrow \infty}\frac{T_c(x)}{π(x)}\le -\frac{7}{2}\log c $$ for $e^{-\frac{2}{7}}< c<1$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Preprints of the St.Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics 07/2025

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The suggested approach is based on a known representation of Dirichlet $L$-functions via the incomplete gamma functions. Some properties of the Taylor coefficients of the lower incomplete gamma function at infinity seem to be new. Specifically, these coefficients can be expressed in terms of Touchard polynomials. Furthermore, these same coefficients can be used to reformulate the functional equation for Dirichlet $L$-functions. This relationship "explains"' why $\vert L_χ(1/2+i t)\vert $ should be small. To present the new ideas in a nutshell, we start by giving (in Section 1) a "formula proof" of the Lindelöf hypothesis. This is not a genuine proof, as we are not concerned with the convergence of our series nor do we justify changing the order of summation. In Section 2, we suggest some hypothetical ways of transforming the "proof" from Section 1 into a rigorous mathematical proof. Sections 3-5 contain some technical details and bibliographical references.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve. We say that $E$ has a near coincidence of level $(n,m)$ if $m \mid n$ and $\mathbb{Q}(E[n]) = \mathbb{Q}(E[m],ζ_{n})$. We classify near coincidences of prime power level and use this result to give a classification of values of $n$ for which ${\rm Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(E[n])/\mathbb{Q})$ is a nilpotent group. Along the way we prove a Gauss-Wantzel analog for the elliptic curve $E\colon y^2 = x^3-x$, showing that $\mathbb{Q}(E[n])/\mathbb{Q}$ is constructible if and only if $\varphi(n)$ is a power of 2. Assuming that there are no non-CM rational points on the modular curves $X_{ns}^{+}(p)$ for primes $p > 11$, we show that ${\rm Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(E[n])/\mathbb{Q})$ nilpotent implies that $n$ is a power of $2$ or $n \in \{ 3, 5, 6, 7, 15, 21 \}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A set $\mathcal S\subset \mathbb N$ is said to be a subset-sum-distinct or dissociated if all of its finite subsets have different sums. Alternately, an equivalent classification is if any equality of the form $$\sum_{s\in \mathcal S} \varepsilon_s \cdot s =0$$ where $\varepsilon_s \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ implies that all the $\varepsilon_s$'s are $0$. For a dissociated set $\mathcal S$, we prove that for $c_\ast = \frac 12 \log_2 \left(\frac π2\right)$ and any $c_\ast-1<C<c_\ast$, we have $$\mathcal S(n) \,:=\, \mathcal S\cap [1,n] \,\le\, \log_2 n +\frac 12 \log_2\log_2 n + C$$ for all $n\in \mathcal N_C$ with asymptotic density $\mathbf d\left(\mathcal N_C\right)=2-2^{c_\ast-C}$. Further, we consider the greedy algorithm for generating these sets and prove that this algorithm always eventually doubles.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a finite set $S$ of distinct primes, we propose a method to construct polylogarithmic motivic Chabauty-Kim functions for $\mathbb{P}^1 \setminus \{ 0,1,\infty \}$ using resultants. For a prime $p\not\in S$, the vanishing loci of the images of such functions under the $p$-adic period map contain the solutions of the $S$-unit equation. In the case $\vert S\vert=2$, we explicitly construct a non-trivial motivic Chabauty-Kim function in depth 6 of degree 18, and prove that there do not exist any other Chabauty-Kim functions with smaller depth and degree. The method, inspired by work of Dan-Cohen and the first author, enhances the geometric step algorithm developed by Corwin and Dan-Cohen, providing a more efficient approach.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a new decomposition formula for two orthogonal projections P and Q on a separable Hilbert space V. This formula yields an orthogonal direct sum decomposition of V into invariant subspaces under P and Q, each of which is either at most two dimensional or infinite dimensional. On every infinite dimensional component, the pair (P,Q) admits a matrix representation that we call the "one-shifted form". This representation diagonalizes both P and Q into blocks of size at most two, and moreover, both projections can be explicitly approximated by orthogonal projections on finite dimensional subspaces. This approximation scheme offers a way to derive infinite dimensional results from their finite dimensional counterparts and is also useful in numerical computations. This decomposition provides a useful framework for analyzing a wide range of problems involving two orthogonal projections in infinite dimensions. In particular, several spectral problems for operators generated by P and Q (including polynomials in P and Q) can be reduced to the case where the pair admits a one-shifted form. More concretely, we can estimate the spectral radius of [P,Q], which is equivalent to estimating the spectral radius of the Bell-CHSH operator, a quantity of fundamental importance in quantum mechanics. We provide an upper bound and a lower bound for the spectral radius of [P,Q], which become exact when the matrix representations of P and Q are in "constant-angle one-shifted form".</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We address an inverse problem in non-Archimedean dynamics: given a finite discrete dynamical system (equivalently, a functional graph on $N$ states), construct a continuous $p$-adic dynamical system whose residue-level behavior reproduces the prescribed transitions. Using the cylinder partition of $\mathcal{O}_K$ (viewed as \emph{Witt cylinders} for unramified $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$), we encode states by pairwise disjoint closed balls and formalize an \textbf{interpreter} as a map sending each state ball into its target ball. Our main existence result constructs rational interpreters that are analytic (hence pole-free) on the prescribed state cylinders, combining rigid-analytic Runge approximation with finite interpolation constraints. Under a linear-dominance condition on each cylinder, ball images are explicit and locally affine, leading to a robust classification of discrete behavior into contractive, indifferent, and expansive regimes. Good reduction provides a selection principle for natural interpreters; effective degree and height bounds for general rational interpreters remain open. For composite alphabets we prove a \textbf{Dynamic Chinese Remainder Theorem} for congruence-preserving systems: the CRT isomorphism $Θ:\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}\xrightarrow{\sim}\prod_i\mathbb{Z}/p_i^{k_i}\mathbb{Z}$ (for $m=\prod p_i^{k_i}$) yields a factorization of the \emph{dynamics} (equivalently, the functional graph) on $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ into dynamics on the prime-power components, compatible with reduction. Finally, we discuss an inverse-limit (profinite) extension: compatible towers define a $1$-Lipschitz map on $\mathbb{Z}_p$, while selecting compatible analytic/rational interpreters across levels becomes a separate problem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop and numerically analyze an algebraic-geometric framework for spin-adapted coupled-cluster (CC) theory. Since the electronic Hamiltonian is SU(2)-invariant, physically relevant quantum states lie in the spin singlet sector. We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the quantum virtual Grothendieck ring, denoted by $\frakK_q(\g)$, which was introduced in [39], and further investigated in [26, 25]. Our approach involves examining this ring from two perspectives: first, by considering its connection to quantum cluster algebras of non-skew-symmetric types; and second, by exploring its relevance to categorification theory. We specifically focus on (i) the homomorphisms that arise from braid moves, particularly 4-moves and 6-moves, in the braid group; and (ii) the quantum Laurent positivity phenomena, which has not yet been proven for non-skew-symmetric types. As applications of our results, we derive the substitution formulas for non-skew-symmetric types discussed in [11] for skew-symmetric types, and demonstrate that any truncated element in a heart subring, denoted by $\frakK_{q,Q}(\g)$, which corresponds to a simple module over the quiver Hecke algebra $R^\g$, possesses coefficients in $\Z_{\ge 0}[q^{\pm 1/2}]$. This result is particularly interesting because it implies that each truncated Kirillov--Reshetikhin polynomial in $\frakK_{q,Q}(\g)$ and each element in the standard basis $\sfE_q(\g)$ of the entire ring $\frakK_q(\g)$ have coefficients also in $\Z_{\ge 0}[q^{\pm 1/2}]$. Since (truncated) Kirillov--Reshetikhin polynomials can be obtained using a quantum cluster algebra algorithm and appear as quantum cluster variables, they provide compelling evidence in support of the quantum Laurent positivity conjecture in non-skew-symmetric types.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For odd primes $p$, we let $K_p:=\mathbb{Q}(ζ_p)$ be the $p$th cyclotomic field and let $ω$ denote its Teichmuller character. For $α>1/2$, we say that an odd prime $p$ is partially regular if the eigenspaces of the $p$-Sylow subgroup of $\mathrm{Cl}(K_p)$ under the Galois action vanish for all characters $ω^{p-2k}$ with $$ 2\le 2k \le \frac{\sqrt{p}}{(\log p)^α}. $$ Equivalently, $p\nmid \mathrm{num}(B_{2k})$ throughout this range. We prove that a density-one subset of primes is partially regular in this sense. By Leopoldt reflection, this yields a partial Vandiver Theorem: for a density-one set of primes $p$, the even eigenspaces $A_p(ω^{2k})$ vanish for all even $2k$ satisfying the inequality above. This result has consequences for Kubota-Leopoldt $p$-adic $L$-functions, congruences between cusp forms and Eisenstein series, and $p$-torsion in algebraic $K$-groups. The theorem proving partial regularity for almost all $p$ is fully formalized in Lean/Mathlib and was produced automatically by AxiomProver from a natural-language statement of the conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Enrico Bombieri showed conditionally (1994) that the ABC conjecture implies Roth's theorem, and Van Frankenhuysen (1999) later provided a complete proof. Building on Bombieri's and Van der Poorten's explicit formula for continued-fraction coefficients of algebraic numbers (specialized to cubic roots) we derive an effective bound for a Roth-type constant assuming an effective form of ABC. Roth's original argument establishes existence but does not yield an explicit value; our approach makes the dependence on the ABC parameters explicit and also gives an explicit bound in the corresponding special case of Ridout's theorem. We then introduce the notion of approximation gain as a refinement of the quality of an abc-triple. For c in a large computational range, the approximation gain remains below a strikingly small threshold, motivating the conjecture that the approximation gain is always smaller than 1.5. This suggests a potential strategy for attacking ABC by bounding approximation gain and power gain separately.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 36 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical Erdős-Kac theorem states that for $n$ chosen uniformly at random from $1, \dots, N$, the random variable $(ω(n) - \log\log N)/\sqrt{\log\log N}$ converges in distribution to the standard Gaussian as $N$ tends to infinity. Banks and Shparlinski showed that this Gaussian convergence holds for any Beatty sequence $\lfloorαn + β\rfloor$ in place of $n$. Continuing in this spirit, Crnčević, Hernández, Rizk, Sereesuchart and Tao considered the joint distribution of $ω(n)$ and $ω(\lfloorαn\rfloor)$, which they showed to be asymptotically independent for irrational values of $α$. Generalising both results, we show that for any positive integer $k$, real numbers $α_1, \dots, α_k > 0$ and $β_1, \dots, β_k$, where $α_i/α_j$ is irrational for $i\neq j$, the joint distribution of $(ω(\lfloorα_in + β_i\rfloor) - \log\log N)/\sqrt{\log\log N}$ converges to the $k$-dimensional standard Gaussian. We next discuss quantitative bounds on the rate of convergence which do not depend on the values taken by the relevant parameters. Banks and Shparlinski remarked that such quantitative bounds may be given for a single Beatty sequence $\lfloorαn + β\rfloor$ under Diophantine type assumptions on $α$. We show that such assumptions are in fact unnecessary. Specifically, for any real numbers $α> 0, β$, we show that the Kolmogorov distance between the random variable $(ω(\lfloorαn + β\rfloor) - \log\log N)/\sqrt{\log\log N}$ and the standard Gaussian is bounded above by $O(\log\log\log N/\sqrt{\log\log N})$ as $N$ tends to infinity. On the other hand, we show that universal quantitative bounds of this kind do not exist for higher-degree generalised polynomials or for the joint convergence for multiple Beatty sequences.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The one-dimensional orbit set $\langle F : s \rangle$ is formed by the images of a number $s$ under the action of a semigroup generated by integer affine functions $f_i=a_i x+b_i$ taken from the set $F=\{f_1,\ldots,f_n\}$. P.Erdős established an upper bound $O(x^{σ+ε})$ for the growth function $|\langle F : s \rangle\cap[0,x]|$, where $1/a_1^σ+1/a_2^σ+\ldots + 1/a_n^σ=1$ and $\varepsilon>0$, which was extended to orbit multisets and real affine functions by J.Lagarias. We complement this by a lower bound $Ω(x^σ)$ for the multiset size $|\langle F : s \rangle^\#\cap[0,x]|$. P.Erdős and R.Graham asked whether an orbit set $\langle F : s \rangle$ has positive density when $F$ is a basis of a free semigroup and $1/a_1+1/a_2+\ldots + 1/a_n=1$. Under these two conditions, we establish a sublinear lower bound $|\langle F : s \rangle \cap [0,x]|=Ω(x/\log^{\frac{n-1}2} x)$. We also show that in the case when the functions of $F$ form an exact covering system of integers, i.e. when $f_1(\mathbb Z) \sqcup \ldots \sqcup f_n(\mathbb Z)=\mathbb Z$, this bound can be strengthened to $Ω(x)$, so the set $\langle F : s \rangle$ has positive density.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be an algebraic group over a field $k$, and $M$ and $N$ be $G$-modules. In 1961, Hochschild showed how one can define the cohomology groups $\text{Ext}_{G}^{i}(M,N)$. Kimura, in 1965, showed that one can generalize this to get relative cohomology for algebraic groups. The original cohomology groups play an important role in understanding the representation theory of $G$, but the role of relative cohomology is still not well understood. In this paper the author expands upon the work of Kimura to prove foundational results about the relative cohomology. The author starts by giving the definitions of relative exact sequences and relative injective modules and proves a variety of basic properties for each that will be essential to define relative cohomology and obtain a relative Grothendieck spectral sequence. In particular, the induction functor will play an important role when studying the relative injective modules. Once the necessary ground work is laid, the definition of relative cohomology is given. Finally, it is stated when there is a relative Grothendieck spectral sequence, and many consequences and examples are provided.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a prime power \( q \) and a positive integer \( n \), a subspace \( U \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^n \) is called cyclically covering if the union of all its cyclic shifts covers the whole space \( \mathbb{F}_q^n \). Let \( h_q(n) \) denote the maximum possible codimension of such a subspace. This paper focuses on the case \( h_q(n) = 0 \). We provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which \( h_q(n) = 0 \) holds. As an application, we show that \( h_q(\ell^t) = 0 \) whenever \( q \) is a primitive root modulo \( \ell^t \). Moreover, we prove that if \( n \) is odd and \( h_q(n) = 0 \), then also \( h_q(2n) = 0 \). As an example, we show that \( h_3(11) =h_3(16) = 1 \). Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between the coverings of \(\mathbb{F}_{q^m}^n\) and \(\mathbb{F}_q^{mn}\), and obtain several sufficient conditions for \(h_{q^m}(n) = 0\). Specifically, we derive that if \(n = 3\) or \(n = 2^d\) (where \(d\) is a nonnegative integer), then \(h_4(n) = 0\).</p></details>

Motivated by Okuda's classification of semisimple symmetric spaces admitting proper $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$-actions [J. Differ.

As a rigidity result, we show that any connected non-compact semisimple Lie group acting properly on this family must be globally isomorphic to $Spin(n,1)$ up to compact factors. Moreover, the largest value of $n$ for the existence of $Spin(n,1)$-proper actions is governed by the Hurwitz-Radon number. Our family includes the pseudo-Riemannian hyperbolic space $\mathbf{H}_{+}^{N,N-1}$ of signature $(N,N-1)$.</p></details>

We study the Petersson inner product of a Hermitian Eisenstein series of Siegel type on the unitary group $U_{5}(K)$, diagonally-restricted on $U_2(K)\times U_2(K)\times U_1(K)$, against two Hermitian cuspidal eigenforms $F, G$ of degree $2$ and an elliptic cuspidal eigenform $h$ (seen as a Hermitian modular form of degree 1), all having weight $k \equiv 0 \pmod 4$. We obtain, through this consideration, an integral representation of a certain Dirichlet series, together with an additional residue term. By taking $F$ to belong in the Maass space, we are able to show that the Dirichlet series possesses an Euler product. Moreover, its $p$-factor for an inert prime $p$ can be essentially identified with the twist by $h$ of a degree six Euler factor attached to $G$ by Gritsenko. The question of whether the same holds for the primes that split remains unanswered here, even though we make considerable steps in that direction too. Our paper is inspired by a work of Heim, who considered a similar question in the case of Siegel modular forms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For semisimple Lie algebras, the BGG resolution is often viewed as a categorification of the Weyl character formula. For general linear Lie superalgebras, Brundan--Stroppel constructed an infinite resolution of the so-called Kostant simple modules by Kac modules, but their construction does not directly generalize the classical BGG resolution. In this paper we construct, for weights lying outside a neighborhood of the walls of the Weyl chambers, a resolution that categorifies a known Weyl-type finite-sum character formula in the same spirit as the Kac--Wakimoto formula. Our resolution is built from images of canonical homomorphisms between Verma modules attached to non-conjugate Borel subalgebras related by odd reflections. In particular, the construction developed here does generalize the classical BGG resolution.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Twisted $L$-functions by Dirichlet characters offer deep insights into arithmetic geometry, especially in the study of elliptic curves and abelian varieties over number fields. In the function field setting, Drinfeld modules and Anderson modules serve as analogues of elliptic curves and abelian varieties, and Goss $L$-series play the role of Hasse-Weil $L$-functions. This paper introduces a motivic framework for studying twisted Goss $L$-series via Anderson motives associated to Drinfeld modules and Artin representations. For a Drinfeld module and an Artin representation on the absolute Galois group, we present a construction of Anderson motives associated to them and we show that it comes from a uniformizable abelian Anderson module. We also study their associated $L$-series, which recover the norm of the twisted Goss $L$-values. These results provide an interpretation of twisted Goss $L$-values in terms of regulators of Anderson modules with the help of Taelman's class number formula.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $α\in \mathbb{R}$, let $$G_α:= \left< \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} , \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ α& 1 \end{bmatrix} \right> < \mathrm{SL}_2 (\mathbb{R}).$$ K. Kim and the first author established the orbit test, which provides a sufficient condition for $G_α$ not to be a rank-$2$ free group. In this article, we present two main applications of the orbit test. First, using the corresponding modulo homomorphism, we show that the converse of the orbit test does not hold. In particular, we construct explicit counterexamples, all of which are rational. As another application, we construct sequences of non-free rational numbers converging to $3$. These sequences are given by $$ 3 + \frac{3}{2 (9 n - 1)} \quad \text{and} \quad 3 + \frac{9 n + 5}{3 (2 n + 1) (9 n + 4)},$$ and their construction relies on the orbit test together with a modified Pell's equation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we introduce the singular twin monoid and its corresponding group, constructed from both algebraic and topological perspectives. We then classify all complex homogeneous $2$-local representations of this constructed group. Moreover, we study the irreducibility of these representations and provide clear conditions under which irreducibility holds. Our results give a structured approach to understanding this new algebraic object and its representations.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Revised and reformulated throughout. The exposition now emphasizes the reduction to a function field cokernel model, and the manuscript has been updated (following an anonymous referee's suggestion) to appropriately credit prior related work of Cheong-Yu

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this note, we study the distribution of the rational canonical form of a random matrix over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$, whose entries are independent and $ε$-balanced with $ε\in(0,1-1/p]$. We show that, as the matrix size tends to infinity, the statistics converge to independent Cohen-Lenstra distributions, demonstrating the universality of this asymptotic behavior. In particular, we recover, as a special case, the uniform setting proved by Fulman in his thesis in 1997. Our proof uses the fact that the rational canonical form data of $A_n$ and the $\mathbb{F}_p[t]$-module structure of the function field cokernel $\Cok(tI_n-A_n)$ determine each other uniquely. Consequently, our question can be reformulated, equivalently, as the asymptotic distribution problem for this cokernel, which has been established by Cheong-Yu (arXiv:2303.09125).</p></details>
