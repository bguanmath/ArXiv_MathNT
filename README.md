### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02309v1'>2510.02309</a>\]&nbsp; **Effective Brauer-Siegel theorems for Artin $L$-functions**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Peter J. Cho, Robert J. Lemke Oliver, Asif Zaman &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a number field $K \neq \mathbb{Q}$, in a now classic work, Stark pinpointed the possible source of a so-called Landau-Siegel zero of the Dedekind zeta function $\zeta_K(s)$ and used this to give effective upper and lower bounds on the residue of $\zeta_K(s)$ at $s=1$. We extend Stark's work to give effective upper and lower bounds for the leading term of the Laurent expansion of general Artin $L$-functions at $s=1$ that are, up to the value of implied constants, as strong as could reasonably be expected given current progress toward the generalized Riemann hypothesis. Our bounds are completely unconditional, and rely on no unproven hypotheses about Artin $L$-functions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Persi Diaconis, Calder Morton-Ferguson &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.PR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 24 pages, 5 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper studies a basic Markov chain, the Burnside process, on the space of flags $G/B$ with $G = GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $B$ its upper triangular matrices. This gives rise to a shuffling: a Markov chain on the symmetric group realized via the Bruhat decomposition. Actually running and describing this Markov chain requires understanding Springer fibers and the Steinberg variety. The main results give a practical algorithm for all n and q and determine the limiting behavior of the chain when q is large. In describing this behavior, we find interesting connections to the combinatorics of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence and to the geometry of orbital varieties. The construction and description is then carried over to finite Chevalley groups of arbitrary type, describing a new class of Markov chains on Weyl groups.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02280v1'>2510.02280</a>\]&nbsp; **An efficient quantum algorithm for computing $S$-units and its applications**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jean-Francois Biasse, Fang Song &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** cs.CR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Long version of a paper from SODA 2016

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we provide details on the proofs of the quantum polynomial time algorithm of Biasse and Song (SODA 16) for computing the $S$-unit group of a number field. This algorithm directly implies polynomial time methods to calculate class groups, S-class groups, relative class group and the unit group, ray class groups, solve the principal ideal problem, solve certain norm equations, and decompose ideal classes in the ideal class group. Additionally, combined with a result of Cramer, Ducas, Peikert and Regev (Eurocrypt 2016), the resolution of the principal ideal problem allows one to find short generators of a principal ideal. Likewise, methods due to Cramer, Ducas and Wesolowski (Eurocrypt 2017) use the resolution of the principal ideal problem and the decomposition of ideal classes to find so-called ``mildly short vectors'' in ideal lattices of cyclotomic fields.</p></details>

In enriched settings, this recovers constructions of Keller, Seidel, and Chen-Wang. We also relate this procedure to localisation by spectra and to Heller's stabilisation.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 281+ix pages; added chapter 4 on non-adjoint groups; several revisions in earlier chapter. All comments very welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>These are expanded notes from graduate courses about Lie algebras and Chevalley groups held at the University of Stuttgart. In the 1950s Chevalley showed how linear groups over arbitrary fields could be obtained~ -- ~by a uniform procedure~ -- ~from the simple Lie algebras over $\C$ occurring in the Cartan--Killing classification. Together with subsequent variations, Chevalley's work had a profound and long-lasting impact on group theory and Lie theory in general. Classical, and widely used references are the lectures notes by Steinberg (1967) and the monograph by Carter (1972). Our aim here is to present a self-contained introduction to the theory of Chevalley groups, based on recent simplifications arising from Lusztig's fundamental theory of ``canonical bases''. A further feature of our text is that we explicitly incorporate algorithmic methods in our treatment, both for the handling of substantial examples and regarding some aspects of the general theory. Eventually, this may turn into a book project.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 35 pages. Title updated. Section 3 updated with general results. Section 6 split off into arxiv:2510.01090

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper concerns the characteristic-$p$ fibers of $\mathsf{GU}(q-2,2)$ Shimura varieties, which classify abelian varieties with additional structure. These Shimura varieties admit two stratifications of interest: the Ekedahl-Oort stratification, based on the isomorphism class of the $p$-torsion subgroup scheme, and the Newton stratification, based on the isogeny class of the $p$-divisible group. In this paper, we present several novel techniques that give a better understanding of the Ekedahl-Oort stratification and of the interaction between the two stratifications for a general signature $(q-2,2)$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19626v3'>2502.19626</a>\]&nbsp; **A note on weight filtrations at the characteristic**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Toni Annala, Piotr Pstrągowski &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.KT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Fixed broken cross references

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that $\kgl$-linear cohomology theories over an affine Dedekind scheme $S$ admit a canonical weight filtration on resolvable motives without inverting residual characteristics. Combined with upcoming work of Annala--Hoyois--Iwasa, this endows essentially all known logarithmic cohomology theories with weight filtrations when evaluated on projective sncd pairs $(X,D)$ over $S$. Furthermore, the weight-filtered cohomology is an invariant of the open part $U = X-D$. On variants of de Rham cohomology, we show that our weight filtration recovers the d\'ecalaged pole-order filtration defined by Deligne. One interpretation of this is that the spectral sequence associated to the pole-order filtration is an invariant of $U$ from the $E_2$-page onwards, which generalizes a result of Deligne from characteristic 0 to positive and mixed characteristic, and suggests that ``mixed Hodge theory'' is a useful invariant of $S$-schemes. Finally, we compute explicit examples of weight filtered pieces of cohomology theories. One of the computations reproves a slight weakening of a result of Thuillier stating that the singular cohomology of the dual complex associated to the boundary divisor of a good projective compactification does not depend on the chosen compactification. In the appendix, we prove the folklore results that the Whitehead tower functor is fully faithful and that perfect bivariant pairings with respect to the twisted arrow category correspond to duality.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02188v1'>2510.02188</a>\]&nbsp; **On the behavior of the colored Jones polynomial of the figure-eight knot under modular transformations**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Christoph Aistleitner, Manuel Hauke &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 34 pages, 3 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The colored Jones polynomial $J_{K,N}$ is an important quantum knot invariant in low-dimensional topology. In his seminal paper on quantum modular forms, Zagier predicted the behavior of $J_{K,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$ under the action of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ on $x \in \mathbb{Q}$. More precisely, Zagier made a prediction on the asymptotic value of the quotient $J_{K,0}(e^{2 \pi i \gamma(x)})/ J_{K,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$ for fixed $\gamma \in SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$, as $x \to \infty$ along rationals with bounded denominator. In the case of the figure-eight knot $4_1$, which is the most accessible case, there is an explicit formula for $J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$ as a sum of certain trigonometric products called Sudler products. By periodicity, the behavior of $J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$ under the mapping $x \mapsto x+1$ is trivial. For the second generator of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$, Zagier conjectured that with respect to the mapping $x \mapsto 1/x$, the quotient $h(x) = \log ( J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i x}) / J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i /x}))$ can be extended to a function on $\mathbb{R}$ that is continuous at all irrationals. This conjecture was recently established by Aistleitner and Borda in the case of all irrationals that have an unbounded sequence of partial quotients in their continued fraction expansion. In the present paper we prove Zagier's continuity conjecture in full generality.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yucong Du, Xin Huang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2309.14489 by other authors

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Kleshchev and Livesey proved the existence of RoCK $p$-blocks for double covers of symmetric and alternating groups over large enough coefficient rings. They proved that RoCK blocks of double covers are Morita equivalent to standard ``local" blocks via bimodules with endopermutation source. Based on this, Kleshchev and Livesey proved that these RoCK blocks are splendidly Rickard equivalent to their Brauer correspondents. The analogous result for blocks of symmetric groups, a theorem of Chuang and Kessar, was an important step in Chuang and Rouquier ultimately proving Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for symmetric groups. In this paper we show that in most cases the Morita equivalences and splendid Rickard equivalences constructed by Kleshchev and Livesey descend to the ring $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p$-adic integers, hence prove Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for most of these RoCK blocks.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** A. Gavshin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The connection between simple Lie algebras and their Yangian algebras has a long history. In this work, we construct finite-dimensional representations of Yangian algebras $\mathsf{Y}(\mathfrak{sl}_{n})$ using the quiver approach. Starting from quivers associated to Dynkin diagrams of type A, we construct a family of quiver Yangians. We show that the quiver description of these algebras enables an effective construction of representations with a single non-zero Dynkin label. For these representations, we provide an explicit construction using the equivariant integration over the corresponding quiver moduli spaces. The resulting states admit a crystal description and can be identified with the Gelfand-Tsetlin bases for $\mathfrak{sl}_{n}$ algebras. Finally, we show that the resulting Yangians possess notable algebraic properties, and the algebras are isomorphic to their alternative description known as the second Drinfeld realization.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nikita Kalinin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Topographs, introduced by Conway in 1997, are infinite trivalent planar trees used to visualize the values of binary quadratic forms. In this work, we study series whose terms are indexed by the vertices of a topograph and show that they can be evaluated using telescoping sums over its edges. Our technique provides arithmetic proofs for modular graph function identities arising in string theory, yields alternative derivations of Hurwitz-style class number formulas, and provides a unified framework for well-known Mordell-Tornheim series and Hata's series for the Euler constant $\gamma$. Our theorems are of the following spirit: we cut a topograph along an edge (called the root) into two parts, and then sum $\frac{1}{rst}$ (the reciprocal of the product of labels on regions adjacent to a vertex) over all vertices of one part. We prove that such a sum is equal to an explicit expression depending only on the root and the discriminant of the topograph.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Aidan Botkin, Madeline L. Dawsey, David J. Hemmer, Matthew R. Just, Robert Schneider &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 19 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, under revision for publication

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We make an application of ideas from partition theory to a problem in multiplicative number theory. We propose a deterministic model of prime number distribution, from first principles related to properties of integer partitions, that naturally predicts the prime number theorem as well as the twin prime conjecture. The model posits that, for $n\geq 2$, $$p_{n}\ =\ 1\ +\ 2\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\left\lceil \frac{d(j)}{2}\right\rceil\ +\ \varepsilon(n),$$ where $p_k$ is the $k$th prime number, $d(k)$ is the divisor function, and $\varepsilon(k)$ is an explicit error term that is negligible asymptotically; both the main term and error term represent enumerative functions in our conceptual model. We refine the error term to give numerical estimates of $\pi(n)$ similar to those provided by the logarithmic integral, and much more accurate than $\mathrm{li}(n)$ up to $n=10{,}000$ where the estimates are {\it almost exact}. We then perform computational tests of unusual predictions of the model, finding limited evidence of predictable variations in prime gaps.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 38 pages, 9 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct and study representations of rational and pretzel tangle and knot groups into the affine group $\mathrm{AGL}(1,\mathbb{C})$, via a TQFT that is valued in the category of spans of singular vector bundles over $\mathbb{C}^{\ast}$. For these families, we derive closed-form expressions for their Alexander polynomials and establish bounds on their zeros. Finally, we specialize the functor at $t=-1$ and analyze colorings of rational tangles in terms of spans of complex vector spaces.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 91 pages, 12 figures, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the homology of modules for Hurwitz spaces stabilizes and compute its stable value. As one consequence, we compute the moments of Selmer groups in quadratic twist families of abelian varieties over suitably large function fields. As a second consequence, we deduce a version of Bhargava's conjecture, counting the number of $S_d$ degree $d$ extensions of $\mathbb F_q(t)$, for suitably large $q$. As a third consequence, we deduce that the homology of Hurwitz spaces associated to racks with a single component satisfy representation stability.</p></details>

We establishes that, if the irrationality exponent of $\xi$ is less than $2.324 \ldots$, then the $b$-ary expansion of $\xi$ cannot be `too simple', in a suitable sense.

We then deduce the construction of accurate non tempered automorphic congruences for a similitude group $G/\mathbb Q$ with signature $(1,d-1)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: cleveref issues solved

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>On one hand, exact structures were introduced by D. Quillen in the '70s. They can be defined as collections of short exact sequences in a fixed abelian category satisfying additional properties. On the other hand, in a recent work, A. Garver, R. Patrias, and H. Thomas introduced Jordan recoverability. Given a bounded quiver $(Q,R)$, a full additive subcategory of $\mathrm{rep}(Q,R)$ is said to be Jordan recoverable if any $X \in \mathscr{C}$ can be recovered, up to isomorphism, from the Jordan form of its generic nilpotent endomorphisms. Such a subcategory $\mathscr{C}$ is said to be canonically Jordan recoverable if, moreover, there exists a precise algebraic procedure that allows one to get back $X \in \mathscr{C}$ from that same Jordan form data. We introduce a new family of operators, called Gen-Sub operators $\mathrm{GS}_\mathcal{E}$, parametrized by the exact structures $\mathcal{E}$ of abelian categories. After showing some properties of those operators in hereditary abelian categories, by focusing on the setting of modules over type $A$ quivers endowed with the diamond exact structure $\mathcal{E}_\diamond$, we establish that the maximal canonically Jordan recoverable subcategories are precisely of the form $\mathrm{GS}_{\mathcal{E}_\diamond}(T)$ for some tilting object $T$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a stably birational classification for algebraic tori of dimensions $3$ and $4$ over a field $k$. First, we define the weak stably equivalence of algebraic tori and show that there exist $13$ (resp. $128$) weak stably equivalent classes of algebraic tori $T$ of dimension $3$ (resp. $4$) which are not stably rational by computing some cohomological stably birational invariants, e.g. the Brauer-Grothendieck group of $X$ where $X$ is a smooth compactification of $T$, provided by Kunyavskii, Skorobogatov and Tsfasman. We make a procedure to compute such stably birational invariants effectively and the computations are done by using the computer algebra system GAP. Second, we define the $p$-part of the flabby class $[\hat{T}]^{fl}$ as a $\mathbb{Z}_p[{\rm Syl}_p(G)]$-lattice and prove that they are faithful and indecomposable $\mathbb{Z}_p[{\rm Syl}_p(G)]$-lattices unless it vanishes for $p=2$ (resp. $p=2,3$) in dimension $3$ (resp. $4$) via $p$-adic analysis. The $\mathbb{Z}_p$-ranks of them are also given. Third, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for which two not stably rational algebraic tori $T$ and $T^\prime$ of dimensions $3$ (resp. $4$) are stably birationally equivalent in terms of the splitting fields and the weak stably equivalent classes of $T$ and $T^\prime$. In particular, the splitting fields of them should coincide if $\hat{T}$ and $\hat{T}^\prime$ are indecomposable. Forth, for each $7$ cases of not stably but retract rational algebraic tori of dimension $4$, we find an algebraic torus $T^\prime$ of dimension $4$ which satisfies that $T\times_k T^\prime$ is stably rational. Finally, we give a criteria to determine whether two algebraic tori $T$ and $T^\prime$ of general dimensions are stably birationally equivalent when $T$ (resp. $T^\prime$) is stably birationally equivalent to some algebraic torus $T^{\prime\prime}$ of dimension up to $4$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we establish new bounds for classical prime-counting functions. All of our bounds are explicit and assume the Riemann Hypothesis. First, we prove that $|\psi(x) - x|$ and $|\vartheta(x) - x|$ are bounded from above by $$\frac{\sqrt{x}\log{x}(\log{x} - \log\log{x})}{8\pi}$$ for all $x\geq 101$ and $x \geq 2\,657$ respectively, where $\psi(x)$ and $\vartheta(x)$ are the Chebyshev $\psi$ and $\vartheta$ functions. Using the extra precision offered by these results, we also prove new explicit descriptions for the error in each of Mertens' theorems which improve earlier bounds by Schoenfeld.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The theory of representations of a crossed module is a direct generalization of the theory of representations of groups. For a finite group G, the Drinfeld quantum double of the group G is a Hopf algebra that represents a special case of crossed module of finite groups. Here we study how to extend the construction of the Drinfeld quantum double for any other kind of crossed module of finite groups. This leads to a Hopf algebra D(G, H) that presents similarities with a Drinfeld double. We then study simple subalgebras of D(G, H) and give two isomorphisms for the decomposition into a product of simple subalgebras. We then study the category D(G, H)-modFd of finite dimensional modules over D(G, H), which turns out to be isomorphic to the category of finite dimensional representations of finite crossed modules of groups. These categories being monoidal, we also study links between direct sums of simple objects and tensor products of simple objects and give some results for a Clebsch-Gordan formula. We, in this context, present and develop the character theory for representations of crossed modules of finite groups, and detail the proofs. We then study the category itself, which leads to some ribbon invariants.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $1<a<b$ be two relatively prime integers and $\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ the set of non-negative integers. For any non-negative integer $\ell$, denote by $g_{\ell,a,b}$ the largest integer $n$ such that the equation $$n=ax+by,\quad (x,y)\in\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}^{2} \quad (1)$$ has at most $\ell$ solutions. Let $\pi_{\ell,a,b}$ be the number of primes $p\leq g_{\ell,a,b}$ having at least $\ell+1$ solutions for (1) and $\pi(x)$ the number of primes not exceeding $x$. In this article, we prove that for a fixed integer $a\ge 3$ with $\gcd(a,b)=1$, $$ \pi_{\ell,a,b}=\left(\frac{a-2}{2(\ell a+a-1)}+o(1)\right)\pi\bigl(g_{\ell,a,b}\bigr)\quad(\text{as}~ b\to\infty). $$ For any non-negative $\ell$ and relatively prime integers $a,b$, satisfying $e^{\ell+1}\leq a<b$, we show that \begin{equation*} \pi_{\ell,a,b}>0.005\cdot \frac{1}{\ell+1}\frac{g_{\ell,a,b}}{\log g_{\ell,a,b}}. \end{equation*} Let $\pi_{\ell,a,b}^{*}$ be the number of primes $p\leq g_{\ell,a,b}$ having at most $\ell$ solutions for (1). For an integer $a\ge 3$ and a large sufficiently integer $b$ with $\gcd(a,b)=1$, we also prove that $$ \pi^{*}_{\ell,a,b}>\frac{(2\ell+1)a}{2(\ell a+a-1)}\frac{g_{\ell,a,b}}{\log g_{\ell,a,b}}. $$ Moreover, if $\ell<a<b$ with $\gcd(a,b)=1$, then we have \begin{equation*} \pi^{*}_{\ell,a,b}>\frac{\ell+0.02}{\ell+1}\frac{g_{\ell,a,b}}{\log g_{\ell,a,b}}. \end{equation*} These results generalize the previous ones of Chen and Zhu (2025), who established the results for the case $\ell=0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We analyze the one-dimensional semi-classical Schr\"odinger equation on the half-line with a linear potential and Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our main focus is on establishing improved dispersive and Strichartz estimates for this model, which govern the space-time behavior of solutions. We prove refined Strichartz bounds using Van der Corput-type derivative tests, beating previous known results where Strichartz estimates incur 1/4 losses. Moreover, assuming sharp bounds for certain exponential sums, our results indicate the possibility to reduce these losses further to $1/6 + \epsilon$ for all $\epsilon>0$, which would be sharp. We further expect that analogous Strichartz bounds should hold within the Friedlander model domain in higher dimensions.</p></details>

Additionally, we provide explicit combinatorial formulas for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of certain families of nested GVZ $p$-groups with arbitrarily large nilpotency class. We also classify all nested GVZ $p$-groups of order at most $p^5$ and compute the Wedderburn decomposition of their rational group algebras. Finally, we determine a complete set of primitive central idempotents for the rational group algebras of nested GVZ $p$-groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Macdonald operator is known to coincide with a certain element of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra in the Fock representation of levels $(1,0)$. A generalization of this operator to higher levels $(r,0)$ can be built using the coproduct structure, it is diagonalized by the generalized Macdonald symmetric functions, indexed by $r$-tuple partitions and depending on $r$ alphabets. In this paper, we extend to the generalized case some of the known formulas obeyed by ordinary Macdonald symmetric functions, such as the $e_1$-Pieri rule or the identity relating them to Whittaker vectors obtained by Garsia, Haiman, and Tesler. We also propose a generalization of the five-term relation, and the Fourier/Hopf pairing. In addition, we prove the factorized expression of the generalized Macdonald kernel conjectured previously by Zenkevich.</p></details>

We establish a bijection between presentations in ${\rm rep}(e^\perp)$ and presentations compatible with $e$. For quivers with potentials, we show that ${\rm rep}(e^\perp)$ forms a module category of another quiver with potential. We derive mutation formulas for the $\delta$-vectors of positive and negative complements and the dimension vectors of simple modules in ${\rm rep}(e^\perp)$, enabling an algorithm to find the projected quiver with potential. Additionally, we introduce a modified projection for quivers with potentials that preserves general presentations.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We address a conjecture (referred to as sur in the literature) in the representation theory of a reductive p-adic Lie group G which has important implications for the relationship between mod-p smooth representations and pro-p Iwahori-Hecke modules, and is currently only known for G of rank 1. We prove that sur follows from exactness of the associated oriented chain complex of a coefficient system, when restricted to a local region of the Bruhat-Tits building for G. Our main result gives strong evidence towards this exactness in the case where G=SL_3(K) for K a totally ramified extension of Q_p. We also develop new combinatorial techniques for analysing the geometric realisation of the A_2 Bruhat-Tits building, which are fundamental to the proof of our main result, and which we hope will inspire further investigation in Bruhat-Tits theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by recent work of Hirschhorn and the author, Thejitha and Fathima recently considered arithmetic properties satisfied by the function $a_5(n)$ which counts the number of integer partitions of weight $n$ wherein even parts come in only one color (i.e., they are monochromatic), while the odd parts may appear in one of five colors. They proved two sets of Ramanujan--like congruences satisfied by $a_5(n)$, relying heavily on modular forms. In this note, we prove their results via purely elementary means, utilizing generating function manipulations and elementary $q$-series dissections. We then extensively generalize these two sets of congruences to infinite families of divisibility properties in which the results of Thejitha and Fathima are specific instances.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 16 pp. There was a mistake in the statement of the original main result. Now it holds under an additional assumptions. I also added some moment bounds and exponential concentraction inequalities, as well as some applications to a some natural combinatorial problem. In view of that the title of the paper has changed

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X_p, p\in\cP$ be a sequence of independent random variables s.t. $\bbP(X_p=\pm 1)=1/2$. Let $\te_j=\prod_{p|j}X_p$ if $j$ is square free and $\te_j=0$ otherwise. Denote $S_n=\sum_{\ell=1}^n\te_\ell$. The from this point of view proving limit theorems for $S_n$ is natural problem, since $S_n$ mimics the behavior of $e^{\sqrt{\ln(\beta)}}$. It is a natural guiding conjecture that $S_n/\sqrt n$ obeys the central limit theorem (CLT). However, S. Chatterjee conjectured (as expressed in \cite{[25]}) that the CLT should not hold. Chatterjee's conjecture was proved by Harper \cite{[17]}, and by now it is a direct consequence of a more recent breakthrough by Harper \cite{Har20} that $\frac{S_n}{b_n}\to 0$ in $L^1$, where $b_n=(n^{1/2}(\ln(\ln(n)))^{-1/4})u_n, u_n\to\infty$. In particular $S_n/\sqrt n\to 0$. Nevertheless, the question whether there exists a sequence $a_n=o(b_n)$ such that $S_n/a_n$ converges to some limit remains a mystery. Note that the corresponding problem in the Steinhaus Setting was recently resolved by \cite{Gor1}. In this paper make an attempt to shed some light on the convergence of $S_n/a_n$. Additionally, we obtain explicit estimates on hight moments of $S_n$ without restrictions on the size of the moment compared to $n$ like in \cite[Theorem 1.2]{Har19}, which is of independent interest. This is achieved by a martingale argument together with the Burkholder inequality, and it has applications in a natural number theoretic combinatorial problem. Using martingale techniques we will also obtain exponential concentration inequalities for $S_n$ (in the large deviations regime)</p></details>

> **Comment:** 59 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The set of infinite upper-triangular totally positive Toeplitz matrices has a classical parametrisation proved by Edrei et al and originally conjectured by Schoenberg, that involves pairs of sequences of positive real parameters. These matrices (and their parameters) are central for understanding characters of the infinite symmetric group by work of Thoma. On the other hand there is a very different parametrisation theorem that applies to the finite analogue of this set. These finite Toeplitz matrices and their parameters relate to quantum cohomology of flag varieties and mirror symmetry. In this paper we replace the positive reals by a semifield with valuation to then construct tropical analogues for both parametrisation theorems. In the finite case we tropicalise using positive generalised Puiseaux series. This builds on work of Judd and L\"udenbach. In the infinite case we use a new valued semifield of continuous functions. We arrive at different natural infinite analogues of totally positive Toeplitz matrices, depending on a choice of topology on our valued semifield. We then prove an asymptotic result relating the tropical parameters from the finite case to the tropicalisations of the Schoenberg parameters. Moreover, we show that our finite type tropical parametrisation map is given by Lusztig's weight map from the theory of canonical bases. This results in a surprising connection between the classical Edrei theorem with its Schoenberg parameters and Lusztig's canonical basis parametrisation.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 57 pages, v2. Exposition improved, minor typos fixed. Comments very welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the vertex functions of finite type A bow varieties. Vertex functions are K-theoretic analogs of I-functions, and 3d mirror symmetry predicts that the q-difference equations satisfied by the vertex functions of a variety and its 3d mirror dual are the same after a change of variable swapping the roles of the various parameters. Thus the vertex functions are related by a matrix of elliptic functions, which is expected to be the elliptic stable envelope of M. Aganagic and A. Okounkov. We prove all of these statements. The strategy of our proof is to reduce to the case of cotangent bundles of complete flag varieties, for which the q-difference equations can be explicitly identified with Macdonald difference equations. A key ingredient in this reduction, of independent interest, involves relating vertex functions of the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety with those of a ``finer" flag variety. Our formula involves specializing certain K\"ahler parameters (also called Novikov parameters) to singularities of the vertex functions. In the $\hbar\to \infty$ limit, this statement is expected to degenerate to an analogous result about I-functions of flag varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper introduces an archimedean, locally Cantor multi-field $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$ which gives an analog of the $p$-adic number field at a place at infinity of a real quadratic extension $K$ of $\mathbb{Q}$. This analog is defined using a unit $1<\theta\in \mathcal{O}_{K}^{\times}$, which plays the same role as the prime $p$ does in $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$; the elements of $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$ are then greedy Laurent series in the base $\theta$. There is a canonical inclusion of the integers $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ with dense image in $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$ and the operations of sum and product extend to multi-valued operations having at most three values, making $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$ a multi-field in the sense of Marty. We show that the (geometric) completions of 1-dimensional quasicrystals contained in $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ map canonically to $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$. The motivation for this work arises in part from a desire to obtain a more arithmetic treatment of a place at infinity by replacing $\mathbb{R}$ with $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$, with an eye toward obtaining a finer version of class field theory incorporating the ideal arithmetic of quasicrystal rings.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages. Minor improvements in the exposition. To appear in Israel J. Math

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It follows from the Grothendieck-Ogg-Shafarevich formula that the rank of an abelian variety (with trivial trace) defined over the function field of a curve is bounded by a quantity which depends on the genus of the base curve and on bad reduction data. Using a function field version of classical $\ell$-descent techniques, we derive an arithmetic refinement of this bound, extending previous work of the second and third authors from elliptic curves to abelian varieties, and improving on their result in the case of elliptic curves. When the abelian variety is the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve, we produce a more explicit $2$-descent map. Then we apply this machinery to studying points on the Jacobians of certain genus $2$ curves over $k(t)$, where $k$ is some perfect base field of characteristic not $2$.</p></details>

In many cases, these compute the Tor groups of finite length modules over polynomial rings, and this is the first in a series of papers to investigate total rank conjectures from this perspective. These formulas refine and generalize the classical $\rho$-decomposition of Kostant, and in particular we prove that the characters involved exhibit three structural phenomena: divisibility (by a large power of 2), equidistribution, and uniform factorization formulas.</p></details>

We completely describe the interaction of two stratifications of these Shimura varieties: the Ekedahl-Oort stratification, based on the isomorphism class of the $p$-torsion subgroup scheme, and the Newton stratification, based on the isogeny class of the $p$-divisible group. We identify which Ekedahl-Oort and Newton strata intersect.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In order to extend the study of the regular version of the regular inverse Galois problem to skew fields, we generalize the definition of regular field extensions for commutative fields to the case of arbitrary fields. We then propose a general version of the inverse Galois property and show that for a field k, the study of the class InvReg(k) of non-trivial regular extensions of k satisfying this property constitutes a natural generalization of the classical regular inverse Galois problem. Next, we use recent results from Behajaina, Deschamps, and Legrand on the inverse Galois problem in the noncommutative setting to show that certain skew fraction fields h(t, {\sigma}, {\delta}) belong to the class InvReg(h). Finally, we generalize Behajaina's method to construct extensions belonging to InvReg(h) that are not of the form h(t, {\sigma}) with {\sigma} an automorphism of finite order.</p></details>

The proof closely follows and elaborates on a recent argument of D.E. Martin. We expect that there is just one orbit generically.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve with conductor $N=N_+N_-$, where $N_+$ and $N_-$ are coprime and $N_-$ is squarefree. Let $D$ be a positive fundamental discriminant satisfying the modified Heegner hypothesis with respect to $(N_+,N_-)$: primes dividing $N_+$ (resp. $N_-$) split (resp. are inert) in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})$; we denote by $E^D/\mathbb{Q}$ the quadratic twist of $E/\mathbb{Q}$ by $D$. In the first half of the paper we consider the situation where $N_-$ is a squarefree product of an odd number of distinct primes, and we show the following: assuming that $E/\mathbb{Q}$ is of analytic rank zero (resp. one), and that the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer formula holds for $E/\mathbb{Q}$ modulo $(\mathbb{Q}^{\times})^2$, then for those $D$ such that $E^D/\mathbb{Q}$ is of analytic rank one (resp. zero), we also have the validity of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer formula for $E^D/\mathbb{Q}$ modulo $(\mathbb{Q}^{\times})^2$. To show this, we establish auxiliary results without rank assumptions. The most difficult case is when $D$ is even, and our proof crucially relies on the recent classification of how local Tamagawa numbers change under quadratic twists. In the final part of the paper analogous results are also obtained in the other situation when $N_-$ is a squarefree product of an even number distinct primes, concerning the case when both $E/\mathbb{Q}$ and $E^D/\mathbb{Q}$ have analytic rank zero (resp. one). As a consequence of our work, we obtain that if $E/\mathbb{Q}$ is semistable with conductor $N$ and whose analytic rank is at most one, then for any positive fundamental discriminant $D$ that is coprime to $N$, such that $E^D/\mathbb{Q}$ again has analytic rank at most one, we have that the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer formula modulo $(\mathbb{Q}^{\times})^2$ holds for $E/\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if it holds for $E^D/\mathbb{Q}$.</p></details>

Highlights include: asymptotics for cyclics between consecutive squares with a second-order term (Conj.~9), Legendre- and $k$-fold Oppermann-type results in short quadratic intervals (Conj.~6, Conj.~20, and twin cyclics between cubes, Conj.~32), gap and growth analogs (Visser, Rosser, Ishikawa, and a sum-3-versus-sum-2 inequality; Conj.~47,~52,~54,~56), limiting ratios (Vrba and Hassani; Conj.~60,~61), and structure results for Sophie Germain cyclics (Conj.~36,~37). We also resolve two Firoozbakht-type conjectures for cyclics (Conj.~41--42). On the negative side we exhibit counterexamples to the Panaitopol, Dusart, and Carneiro analogs (Conj.~59,~53,~50--51). Finally, for the lexicographically least sequence of pairwise distinct positive integers whose running averages are Fibonacci numbers (\seqnum{A248982}), we give explicit closed forms for all $n$ and prove Fried's Conjecture~2 asserting the disjointness of the parity-defined value sets (equivalently, $F_{n+2}+2nF_{n+1}$ is never a Fibonacci number).

In conjunction with Honda's proof of the $p$-curvature conjecture for order one equations with polynomial coefficients we use this to deduce an effective version of the Grothendieck $p$-curvature conjecture for order one equations. More precisely, we bound the number of primes for which the $p$-curvature of a given differential equation has to vanish in terms of the height and the degree of the coefficients, in order to conclude it has a non-zero algebraic solution. Using this approach, we describe an algorithm that decides algebraicity of solutions of differential equation of order one using $p$-curvatures, and report on an implementation in SageMath.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Stratifying systems, which have been defined for module, triangulated and exact categories previously, were developed to produce examples of standardly stratified algebras. A stratifying system $\Phi$ is a finite set of objects satisfying some orthogonality conditions. One very interesting property is that the subcategory $\mathcal{F}(\Phi)$ of objects admitting a composition series-like filtration with factors in $\Phi$ has the Jordan-H\"{o}lder property on these filtrations. This article has two main aims. First, we introduce notions of subobjects, simple objects and composition series for an extriangulated category, in order to define a Jordan-H\"{o}lder extriangulated category. Moreover, we characterise Jordan-H\"{o}lder, length, weakly idempotent complete extriangulated categories in terms of the associated Grothendieck monoid and Grothendieck group. Second, we develop a theory of stratifying systems in extriangulated categories. We define projective stratifying systems and show that every stratifying system $\Phi$ in an extriangulated category is part of a minimal projective one $(\Phi,Q)$. We prove that $\mathcal{F}(\Phi)$ is a length, Jordan-H\"{o}lder extriangulated category when $(\Phi,Q)$ satisfies a left exactness condition. We give several examples and answer a recent question of Enomoto--Saito in the negative.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is known that a large class of characters of 2d conformal field theories (CFTs) can be written in the form of a Nahm sum. In \cite{Zagier:2007knq}, D. Zagier identified a list of Nahm sum expressions that are modular functions under a congruence subgroup of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and can be thought of as candidates for characters of rational CFTs. Motivated by the observation that the same formulas appear as the half-indices of certain 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories, we perform a general search over low-rank 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ abelian Chern-Simons matter theories which either flow to unitary TFTs or $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-zero SCFTs in the infrared. These are exceptional classes of 3d theories, which are expected to support rational and $C_2$-cofinite chiral algebras on their boundary. We compare and contrast our results with Zagier's and comment on a possible generalization of Nahm's conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $S$ be a semigroup (written multiplicatively). Endowed with the operation of setwise multiplication induced by $S$ on its parts, the non-empty subsets of $S$ form themselves a semigroup, denoted by $\mathcal P(S)$. Accordingly, we say that a semigroup $H$ is globally isomorphic to a semigroup $K$ if $\mathcal P(H)$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal P(K)$; and that a class $\mathscr C$ of semigroups is globally closed if a semigroup in $\mathscr C$ can only be globally isomorphic to an isomorphic copy of a semigroup in the same class. We show that the classes of groups, torsion-free monoids, and numerical monoids are each globally closed. The first result extends a 1967 theorem of Shafer, while the last relies non-trivially on the second and on a classical theorem of Kneser from additive number theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Witt algebra $W_{\geq -1}$ is the Lie algebra of algebraic vector fields on a line. We investigate the two-sided ideal structure of its universal enveloping algebra, by studying the orbit homomorphisms $\Psi_n: U(W_{\geq -1}) \rightarrow T_n$, an infinite family of homomorphisms to noncommutative Noetherian algebras. The orbit homomorphisms lift primitive ideals from solvable Lie algebras to $U(W_{\geq -1})$, thereby playing a central role in the orbit method for the Witt algebra. We prove that the kernel of any orbit homomorphism is generated by an infinite set of differentiators as a one-sided ideal, whilst being generated by any single element of this set as a two-sided ideal. One consequence is an explicit description of primitive and semi-primitive ideals of $U(W_{\geq -1})$ corresponding to one-point local functions. We also prove that the image $B_n$ of the nth orbit homomorphism is both non-Noetherian and birational to the Noetherian algebra $T_n$. On the other hand, the degree zero subring of $B_n$ is left and right Noetherian, and we conjecture that the same holds for $U(W_{\geq -1})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be an extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $A/K$ an elliptic curve. If $\mathrm{Gal}(\bar K/K)$ is finitely generated, then $A$ is of infinite rank over $K$. In particular, this implies the $g=1$ case of the Junker-Koenigsmann conjecture. This "anti-Mordellic'' result follows from a new "Mordellic'' theorem, which asserts that if $K_0$ is finitely generated over $\mathbb{Q}$, the points of an abelian variety $A_0/K_0$ over the compositum of all bounded-degree Galois extensions of $K_0$ form a virtually free abelian group. This, in turn, follows from a second Mordellic result, which asserts that the group of $A_0$ over the extension of $K_0$ defined by the torsion of $A_0(\bar K_0)$ is free modulo torsion.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classification of the finite subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ is a classical problem in the field of finite group theory, dating back to the late 19th century with authors like Klein, Jordan, Blichfeldt, etc. Throughout its long history, many results concerning the classification have been scattered in the mathematical literature. In this survey, we explore many of the most relevant results related to the classification, its structure, and the lists of groups. We mostly focus on the irreducible groups. In particular, classification statements are provided for primitive and imprimitive groups over prime dimension, and quasi-primitive groups of small composite dimension. We also provide tables with a detailed list of all (quasi)-primitive finite groups of dimension $n<8$. Finally, we provide a computer program implementing many of the known results specific to the finite quasisimple irreducible projective groups, to improve and preserve the accessibility to these results and further their classification. See \S 4.2 and [37]. We aim this survey to the non-specialist, so the provided classification results may easily accessible to mathematicians working outside of group theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $L_{\widehat{sl(2|1)}}(\mathcal{k},0)$ be the simple affine vertex operator superalgebra associated to the affine Lie superalgebra $\widehat{sl(2|1)}$ with admissible level $\mathcal{k}$. We conjecture that $L_{\widehat{sl(2|1)}}(\mathcal{k},0)$ is rational in the category $\mathcal{O}$ at boundary admissible level $\mathcal{k}$ and there are finitely many irreducible weak $L_{\widehat{sl(2|1)}}(\mathcal{k},0)$-modules in the category $\mathcal{O}$, where the irreducible modules are exactly the admissible modules of level $\mathcal{k}$ for $\widehat{sl(2|1)}$. In this paper, we first prove this conjecture at boundary admissible level $-\frac{1}{2}$. Then we give an example to show that outside of the boudary levels, $L_{\widehat{sl(2|1)}}(\mathcal{k},0)$ is not rational in the category $\mathcal{O}$. Furthermore, we consider the $\mathbb{Q}$-graded vertex operator superalgebras $(L_{\widehat{sl(2|1)}}(\mathcal{k},0),\omega_\xi)$ associated to a family of new Virasoro elements $\omega_\xi$, where $0<\xi<1$ is a rational number. We determine the Zhu's algebra $A_{\omega_\xi}(L_{\widehat{sl(2|1)}}(-\frac{1}{2},0))$ of $(L_{\widehat{sl(2|1)}}(-\frac{1}{2},0),\omega_\xi)$ and prove that $(L_{\widehat{sl(2|1)}}(-\frac{1}{2},0),\omega_\xi)$ is rational and $C_2$-cofinite. Finally, we consider the case of non-boundary admissible level $\frac{1}{2}$ to support our conjecture, that is, we show that there are infinitely many irreducible weak $L_{\widehat{sl(2|1)}}(\frac{1}{2},0)$-modules in the category $\mathcal{O}$ and $(L_{\widehat{sl(2|1)}}(\frac{1}{2},0),\omega_\xi)$ is not rational.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Euler characteristic of $\ell$-adic local systems on the moduli stack $\mathcal{a}_n$ of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension $n$ associated to algebraic representations of $\mathbf{GSp}_{2n}$, as virtual representations of the absolute Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}$ and the unramified Hecke algebra of $\mathbf{GSp}_{2n}$. To this end we take the last steps of the Ihara-Langlands-Kottwitz method to compute the intersection cohomology of minimal compactifications of Siegel modular varieties in level one, following work of Kottwitz and Morel, proving an unconditional reformulation of Kottwitz' conjecture in this case. This entails proving the existence of $\mathrm{GSpin}$-valued Galois representations associated to certain level one automorphic representations for $\mathbf{PGSp}_{2n}$ and $\mathbf{SO}_{4n}$. As a consequence we prove the existence of $\mathrm{GSpin}$-valued Galois representations associated to level one Siegel eigenforms, a higher genus analogue of theorems of Deligne (genus one) and Weissauer (genus two). Using Morel's work and Franke's spectral sequence we derive explicit formulas expressing the Euler characteristic of compactly supported cohomology of automorphic $\ell$-adic local systems on Siegel modular varieties in terms of intersection cohomology. Specializing to genus three and level one, we prove an explicit conjectural formula of Bergstr\"om, Faber and van der Geer for the compactly supported Euler characteristic in terms of spin Galois representations associated to level one Siegel cusp forms. Specializing to trivial local systems we give explicit formulas for the number of points of $\mathcal{A}_n$ over finite fields for all $n \leq 7$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using the subdivision schemes theory, we develop a criterion to check if any natural number has at most one representation in the $n$-ary number system with a set of non-negative integer digits $A=\{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n\}$ that contains zero. This uniqueness property is shown to be equivalent to a certain restriction on the roots of the trigonometric polynomial $\sum_{k=1}^n e^{-2\pi i a_k t}$. From this criterion, under a natural condition of irreducibility for $A$, we deduce that in case of prime $n$ the uniqueness holds if and only if the digits of $A$ are distinct modulo $n$, whereas for any composite $n$ we show that the latter condition is not necessary. We also establish the connection of this uniqueness to the semigroup freeness problem for affine integer functions of equal integer slope; this together with the two criteria allows to fill the gap in the work of D. Klarner on the question of P. Erd\"os about densities of affine integer orbits and establish a simple algorithm to check the freeness and the positivity of density when the slope is a prime number.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we prove a quantitative version of the prime-to-$p$ Manin--Mumford conjecture for varieties with ample cotangent bundle. More precisely, let $A$ be an abelian variety defined over a number field $F$, and let $X$ be a smooth projective subvariety of $A$ with ample cotangent bundle. We prove that for every prime $p\gg 0$, the intersection of $X(F^{\text{alg}})$ and the geometric prime-to-$p$ torsion of $A$ is finite and explicitly bounded by a summation involving cycle classes in the Chow ring of the reduction of $X$ modulo $p$. This result is a higher dimensional analogue of Buium's quantitative Manin--Mumford for curves. Our proof follows a similar outline to Buium's in that it heavily relies on his theory of arithmetic jet spaces. In this context, we prove that the special fiber of the arithmetic jet space associated to a model of $X$ is affine as a scheme over $\mathbb{F}_p^{\text{alg}}$. As an application of our results, we use a result of Debarre to prove that when $X$ is $\mathbb{Q}^{\text{alg}}$-isomorphic to a complete intersection of $c > \text{dim}(A)/2$ many general hypersurfaces of $A_{\mathbb{Q}^{\text{alg}}}$ of sufficiently large degree, the intersection of $X(F^{\text{alg}})$ and the geometric prime-to-$p$ torsion of $A$ is bounded by a polynomial that depends only on $p$, the dimension of the ambient abelian variety, and intersection numbers of certain products of the hypersurfaces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>From a well-known equation of Hardy, one can derive a simple linear combination of the Euler-Mascheroni constant ($\gamma=0.577215\ldots$) and Euler-Gompertz constant ($\delta=0.596347\ldots$): $\gamma+\delta/e=\textrm{Ein}\left(1\right)$. Although neither $\gamma$ nor $\delta$ is currently known to be irrational, this linear combination has been shown to be transcendental (by virtue of the fact that it appears as an algebraic point value of a particular E-function). Moreover, both pairs ($\gamma$,$\delta$) and ($\gamma$,$\delta/e$) are known to be disjunctively transcendental. In light of these observations, we investigate the impact of the coefficient $\alpha$ in combinations of the form $\gamma+\alpha\delta$, and find that $\alpha=1/e$ is the unique coefficient value such that canonical Borel-summable divergent series for $\gamma$ and $\delta$ can be linearly combined to force conventional convergence of the resulting series. We further indicate how this uniqueness property extends to a sequence of generalized linear combinations, $\gamma^{\left(n\right)}+\alpha\delta^{\left(n\right)}$, with $\gamma^{\left(n\right)}$ and $\delta^{\left(n\right)}$ given by (ordinary and conditional) moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study the Fourier transform on graded Lie algebras. Let $G$ be a complex, connected, reductive, algebraic group, and $\chi:\mathbb{C}^\times \to G$ be a fixed cocharacter that defines a grading on $\mathfrak{g}$, the Lie algebra of $G$. Let $G_0$ be the centralizer of $\chi(\mathbb{C}^\times)$. Here under some assumptions on the field $\Bbbk$ and also assuming two conjectures for the group $G$, we prove that the Fourier transform sends parity complexes to parity complexes. Primitive pairs have played an important role in Lusztig's paper \cite{Lu} to prove a block decomposition in the graded setting. A long term goal of this project is to prove a similar block decomposition in positive characteristic. In this paper we have tried to understand the primitive pair and its relation with the Fourier transform.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that quasi-$F$-pure but not $F$-pure isolated quasi-homogeneous hypersurface singularities necessarily have $F$-pure threshold $1 - \frac{1}{p}$. This extends work of Bhatt and Singh beyond the Calabi-Yau case. We also classify the (quasi)-$F$-purity of Fermat hypersurfaces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give 39 rapidly convergent continued fractions for Chowla--Selberg gamma quotients, and deduce good irrationality measures for 20 of them, including for $\mathrm{CS}(-3)=(\Gamma(1/3)/\Gamma(2/3))^3$, for $a^{1/4}\mathrm{CS}(-4)=a^{1/4}(\Gamma(1/4)/\Gamma(3/4))^2$ with $a=12$ and $a=1/5$, and for $\mathrm{CS}(-7)=\Gamma(1/7)\Gamma(2/7)\Gamma(4/7)/(\Gamma(3/7)\Gamma(5/7)\Gamma(6/7))$. These appear to be the first proved and reasonable irrationality measures for gamma quotients.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a new Euler system for the Galois representation $V_{f,\chi}$ attached to a newform $f$ of weight $2r\geq 2$ twisted by an anticyclotomic Hecke character $\chi$. The Euler system is anticyclotomic in the sense of Jetchev-Nekovar-Skinner. We then show some arithmetic applications of the constructed Euler system, including new results on the Bloch-Kato conjecture in ranks zero and one, and a divisibility towards the Iwasawa-Greenberg main conjecture for $V_{f,\chi}$. In particular, in the case where the base-change of $f$ to our imaginary quadratic field has root number $+1$ and $\chi$ has higher weight (which implies that the complex $L$-function $L(V_{f,\chi},s)$ vanishes at the center), our results show that the Bloch-Kato Selmer group of $V_{f,\chi}$ is nonzero, as predicted by the Bloch-Kato conjecture; and if in addition a certain distinguished class $\kappa_{\,f,\chi}$ is nonzero, then the Selmer group is one-dimensional. Such applications to the Bloch-Kato conjecture for $V_{f,\chi}$ were left wide open by the earlier approaches using Heegner cycles and/or Beilinson-Flach elements. Our construction is based instead on a generalization of the Gross-Kudla-Schoen diagonal cycles.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Consider \begin{align*} G(N,M;\alpha,\beta,K,q) = \sum\limits_{j\in\mathbb{Z}}(-1)^jq^{\frac{1}{2}Kj((\alpha+\beta)j+\alpha-\beta)}\left[\begin{matrix}M+N\\N-Kj\end{matrix}\right]_{q}. \end{align*} In this paper, we prove the non-negativity of coefficients of some cases of $G(N,M;\alpha,\beta,K,q)$. For instance, for non-negative integers $n$ and $t$, we prove that \begin{align*} G\left(n,n;\frac{4}{3}+\frac{3(3^t-1)}{2},\frac{5}{3}+\frac{3(3^t-1)}{2},3^{t+1},q\right) \end{align*} and \begin{align*} G\left(n-\frac{3^t-1}{2},n+\frac{3^t+1}{2};\frac{8}{3}+2(3^t-1),\frac{4}{3}-(3^t-1),3^{t+1},q\right)\\ \end{align*} are polynomials in $q$ with non-negative coefficients. Using cubic positivity preserving transformations of Berkovich and Warnaar and some known formulae arising from Rogers-Szeg\"{o} polynomials, we establish new identities such as \begin{align*} \sum\limits_{0\le 3j\le n}\dfrac{(q^3;q^3)_{n-j-1}(1-q^{2n})q^{3j^2}}{(q;q)_{n-3j}(q^6;q^6)_{j}} = \sum\limits_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}(-1)^jq^{6j^2}{2n\brack n-3j}_q. \end{align*}</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the categorification of collapsed Riemann surfaces with quadratic differentials allowing arbitrary order zeros and poles via the Verdier quotient. We establish an isomorphism between the exchange graph of hearts in the quotient category and the exchange graph of mixed-angulations on the collapsed surface. This extends the work of Barbieri-M\"oller-Qiu-So, who studied Verdier quotients of 3-Calabi-Yau categories and collapsed surfaces without simple poles. We use two methods: a combinatorial approach, and another based on the global sections of a quotient perverse schober. As an application, we describe the Bridgeland stability conditions in terms of quadratic differentials on the collapsed surface.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $n$ and $t$ be positive integers with $t\geq 2$. Let $R_t(n)$ be the number of $t$-regular partitions of $n$. A class of functions, denoted $\tau_k(n)$, is defined as follows: $$q\prod_{m=1}^{\infty}(1-q^m)^k=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\tau_k(n)q^n, $$ where $k$ is an integer. We express $\tau_k(n)$ as a binomial coefficient weighted partition sum. Consequently, we obtain congruence identities that relate $\tau_k(n)$, $R_t(n)$ and partition function weighted composition sums.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 13 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We attach Hecke polynomials $P_n(F;x)$ to weak Hecke eigenforms $F$ of weight $2-k$ and show that, for large $n$, every zero is simple, lies in $[0,1728]$, and the zeros equidistribute on this interval. The construction pulls back a weakly holomorphic Hecke combination of $F$ along $j$; the analysis follows Hecke orbits on the unit-circle arc $\mathcal{A}$, isolating a dominant "cosine" term and controlling the tail via Maass-Poincar\'e series and Whittaker/Bessel bounds. This extends the Rankin--Swinnerton-Dyer/Asai--Kaneko--Ninomiya picture from holomorphic forms to a broad class of harmonic Maass forms and yields a clean degree-monicity formula and simple criteria for zeros at $0$ and $1728$.</p></details>
