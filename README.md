 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Robert Wilms &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the stable Faltings height of the hyperelliptic curve $X_n\colon y^2=x^{n}-1$ for every odd integer $n\ge 3$ in terms of special values of Euler's gamma function. In particular, we prove the bounds $$-0.975n< h_{\mathrm{Fal}}(X_n)-\tfrac{n}{8}\log n<\tfrac{9}{64}n\log\log n-0.263n.$$ As an application, we bound the Faltings height of any abelian variety with complex multiplication by the canonical CM-type of the $n$-th cyclotomic field by $\frac{n}{8}\log n+\frac{9}{64}n\log\log n-0.136n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that for $\gg K^2$ of the half-integral weight Hecke cusp forms in the Kohnen plus subspace with weight bounded by a large parameter $K$, the number of "real" zeroes grows at the expected rate. A key technical step in the proof is to obtain sharp bounds for the mollified first and second moments of quadratic twists of modular $L$-functions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 19 pages. Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given finite groups $H \leq G$, a representation $σ$ of $G$ is called center-preserving on $H$ if the only elements of $H$ that become central under $σ$ are those that were already central in $G$. We prove that if $H$ has a faithful irreducible representation $ρ$, then at least one of the irreducible components of the induction $\mathrm{Ind}_H^G(ρ)$ is center-preserving on $H$. In consequence, $H$ has a faithful irreducible representation if and only if every finite group $G$ containing $H$ as a subgroup has an irreducible representation whose restriction to $H$ is faithful, and which is center-preserving on $H$. In addition, we give examples illustrating the sharpness of the statement, and discuss the connection with projective representations.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Michael R. Powers &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $γ=0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $δ=0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $γ+δ/e=\mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $γ^{(n)}+δ^{(n)}/e=η^{(n)}$, $n\ge0$ for sequences of constants $γ^{(n)}$, $δ^{(n)}$, and $η^{(n)}$ (given respectively by raw, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). Investigating the $γ^{(n)}=\left(-1\right)^{n}Γ^{(n)}(1)$ through recurrence relations, we find that the $γ^{(n)}$ are transcendental infinitely often and that at least two of each set {$γ,γ^{(n)},γ^{(n+1)},...,γ^{(2n)}$}, for $2\leq n\leq26$, are transcendental (with analogous results for $Γ^{(n)}(1)$). We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $η^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent, and therefore transcendental, for all $n\ge0$, implying that at least one of each pair, {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e$} and {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e,δ^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n\ge1$. Further analysis of the $γ^{(n)}$ and $η^{(n)}$ reveals that the $δ^{(n)}/e$ and $δ^{(n)}$ are transcendental infinitely often with asymptotic densities of at least 1/2. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tildeδ^{(n)}$ and $\tildeη^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $γ^{(n)}+\tildeδ^{(n)}/e=\tildeη^{(n)}$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kirsten Eisentraeger, Gabrielle Scullard &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 33 pages. Revised and expanded; added an example to Section 8

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a deterministic polynomial time algorithm to compute the endomorphism ring of a supersingular elliptic curve in characteristic p, provided that we are given two noncommuting endomorphisms and the factorization of the discriminant of the ring $\mathcal{O}_0$ they generate. At each prime $q$ for which $\mathcal{O}_0$ is not maximal, we compute the endomorphism ring locally by computing a q-maximal order containing it and, when $q \neq p$, recovering a path to $\text{End}(E) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_q$ in the Bruhat-Tits tree. We use techniques of higher-dimensional isogenies to navigate towards the local endomorphism ring. Our algorithm improves on a previous algorithm which requires a restricted input and runs in subexponential time under certain heuristics. Page and Wesolowski give a probabilistic polynomial time algorithm to compute the endomorphism ring on input of a single non-scalar endomorphism. Beyond using techniques of higher-dimensional isogenies to divide endomorphisms by a scalar, our methods are completely different.</p></details>

> **Comment:** submitted to Acta Arithmetica

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Dirichlet's Lemma states that every primitive quadratic Dirichlet character $χ$ can be written in the form $χ(n) = (\fracΔn)$ for a suitable quadratic discriminant $Δ$. In this article we define a group, the separant class group, that measures the extent to which Dirichlet's Lemma fails in general number fields $F$. As an application we will show that over fields with trivial separant class groups, genus theory of quadratic extensions can be made as explicit as over the rationals.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that for a non-isotrivial abelian scheme over a smooth curve, the genus of a generic sequence of multi-sections with small heights tends to infinity. As an application, we give a new proof of the uniform boundedness of $\ell$-primary torsion points on fibers of an abelian scheme over a smooth curve, a result originally proved by Cadoret and Tamagawa. Furthermore, our approach allows us to resolve a conjecture of Cadoret and Tamagawa without additional assumptions. Our approach is based on the theory of Betti foliations and the arithmetic equidistribution theorem.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yuhao Cheng &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>At the beginning of this century, Langlands introduced a strategy known as \emph{Beyond Endoscopy} to attack the principle of functoriality. Altuğ studied $\mathsf{GL}_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ in the unramified setting. The first step involves isolating specific representations, especially the residual part of the spectral side, in the elliptic part of the geometric side of the trace formula. We generalize this step to the case with ramification at $S=\{\infty,q_1,\dots,q_r\}$ with $2\in S$, thereby fully resolving the problem of isolating these representations over $\mathbb{Q}$ which remained unresolved for over a decade. Such a formula that isolates the specific representations is derived by modifying Altuğ's approach. We use the approximate functional equation to ensure the validity of the Poisson summation formula. Then, we compute the residues of specific functions to isolate the desired representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{A}=\{a_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ and $\mathcal{B}=\{b_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be two sequences of positive integers (not necessarily distinct). Under some restrictions on $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, we obtain a lower bound for a number of integers $n$ not exceeding $x$ that can be represented as a sum $n = a_i + b_j$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** To appear in the Annales scientifiques de l'{É}cole normale sup{é}rieure. A longer version of this work is available at arXiv:2306.02640

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1984, Deligne proved that for any prime number $p$, the reduction modulo $p$ of the diagonal of a multivariate algebraic power series with integer coefficients is algebraic over the field of rational functions with coefficients in $\mathbb F_p$. Moreover, he conjectured that the algebraic degrees $d_p$ of these functions should grow at most polynomially in $p$. In this article, we provide a new and elementary proof of Deligne's theorem, which yields the first general polynomial bound on $d_p$ with an explicit and reasonable degree.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the structure of tensor products of $\mathfrak{gl}(\infty) = \varinjlim \mathfrak{gl}(n)$-modules $\mathbf L(\mathbf λ) \otimes \mathbf F$ where $\mathbf L(\mathbf λ)$ is a simple integrable highest weight module and $\mathbf F$ is a simple integrable weight multiplicity-free module. Both $\mathbf L(\mathbf λ)$ and $\mathbf F$ are infinite dimensional, in particular $\mathbf F$ can be a Fock module. Similar tensor products of $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$-modules are semisimple and their simple constituents are described by the classical Pieri rule. We prove that a $\mathfrak{gl}(\infty)$-module $\mathbf M:= \mathbf L(\mathbf λ) \otimes \mathbf F$ is semisimple only in relatively trivial cases, and is indecomposable otherwise. Our main results are a description of the simple constituents of $\mathbf M$, and the construction of a linkage filtration on $\mathbf M$ that provides information on when two simple constituents of $\mathbf M$ are linked. Using the linkage filtration, we compute the socle and radical filtrations of $\mathbf M$, and determine when $\mathbf M$ is rigid.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: fixed reference in Section 6

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a quasi-reductive algebraic supergroup $G$, we use the theory of semisimplifications of symmetric monoidal categories to define a symmetric monoidal functor $Φ_x: Rep(G) \to Rep(OSp(1|2))$ associated to any given element $x \in \mathrm{Lie}(G)_{\bar 1}$. For nilpotent elements $x$, we show that the functor $Φ_x$ can be defined using the Deligne filtration associated to $x$. We use this approach to prove an analogue of the Jacobson-Morozov Lemma for algebraic supergroups. Namely, we give a necessary and sufficient condition on odd nilpotent elements $x\in \mathrm{Lie}(G)_{\bar 1}$ which define an embedding of supergroups $OSp(1|2)\to G$ so that $x$ lies in the image of the corresponding Lie algebra homomorphism.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the extended module category $m\mathrm{-mod}Λ$ of an algebra $Λ$, recently introduced by Gupta and Zhou. The existence of a postprojective component of $m\mathrm{-mod}Λ$ is shown for certain algebras $Λ$, and a knitting algorithm through cohomological dimension vectors is provided. In particular, the extended module category of Nakayama algebras with homogeneous relations are investigated, and it is classified when they are of finite type.

> **Comment:** To appear in Advances in Mathematics

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using PET and quantitative concatenation techniques, we establish box-norm control with the "expected" directions for counting operators for general multidimensional polynomial progressions, with at most polynomial losses in the parameters. Such results are often useful first steps towards obtaining explicit upper bounds on sets lacking instances of given such progressions. In the companion paper arXiv:2407.08637, we complete this program for sets in $[N]^2$ lacking nondegenerate progressions of the form $(x, y), (x + P(z), y), (x, y + P(z))$, where $P \in \mathbb{Z}[z]$ is any fixed polynomial with an integer root of multiplicity $1$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 52 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We identify additional structure on a conservative lax monoidal functor from a closed monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$ to a Grothendieck-Verdier category $\mathcal{D}$, such that the Grothendieck-Verdier structure of $\mathcal{D}$ lifts to $\mathcal{C}$ and the functor becomes Frobenius linearly distributive. As an application, we recover and extend conditions under which modules over Hopf monads and Hopf algebroids inherit Grothendieck-Verdier structures. We also characterize when categories of bimodules, modules, and local modules over (commutative) algebras internal to a Grothendieck-Verdier category admit such structures. Our results apply to quantales, smash product algebras, skew group algebras, and enveloping algebras of Lie-Rinehart algebras. For applications of the lifting theorem, we construct a strict $2$-equivalence between a $2$-category of Grothendieck-Verdier categories and one of linearly distributive categories with negation, and extend this $2$-equivalence to the braided setting.</p></details>

We provide a concrete description of completions of bounded derived categories of hereditary finite dimensional algebras of finite representation type. In order to investigate completions of bounded derived categories of algebras of finite global dimension, we define image and preimage metrics under a triangulated functor and use them to induce a triangulated equivalence between two completions. Furthermore, for a given metric on a triangulated category we construct a new, closely related good metric called the improvement and compare the respective completions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 49 pages, 5 figures, v2: a conjecture for the non-simply laced case is added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The problem of solving non-linear equations would be considerably simplified by a possibility to convert known solutions into the new ones. This could seem an element of art, but in the context of ADHM-like equations describing quiver varieties there is a systematic approach. In this note we study moduli spaces and dualities of quiver gauge theories associated to effective dynamics of D-branes compactified on Calabi-Yau resolutions. We concentrate on a subfamily of quivers $\mathfrak{Q}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ covering Dynkin diagrams for simple Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$, where the respective BPS algebra is expected to be the Yangian algebra $Y(\mathfrak{g})$. For Yangians labeled by quivers their representations are described by solutions of ADHM-like equations. As quivers substitute Dynkin diagrams a generalization of the Weyl group $\mathcal{W}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ acts on the ADHM solutions. Here we work with the case $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$ and treat this group as a group of electro-magnetic Seiberg-like dualities (we call them Weyl mutations) on the respective quiver gauge theories. We lift it to the case of higher representations associated to rectangular Young diagrams. An action of Weyl mutations on the BPS Yangian algebra is also discussed.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this short note, we study the spectrum of prime Serre ideals of global representations for noetherian families. In particular, we prove that the spectrum of prime Serre ideals of finitely generated VI-modules is homeomorphic to N^{*}, the one-point compactification of N, which differs from the Balmer spectrum of derived VI-modules. Our method could also be applied to the category of finitely generated FI-modules and the category of global representations for the family of cyclic p-groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The aim of this article is to present in a self-contained way identities arising in elementary number theory, among which the following one: $$ \sum_{d\mid n}\frac{μ^2(d)}{\varphi(d)\,d^s}=\prod_{p\mid n}\left(1+\frac{1}{(p-1)p^s}\right). $$ This formula expresses a non-trivial divisor sum involving the Möbius function $μ$ and Euler's totient function $\varphi$ as a simple and explicit multiplicative expression. This is a generalization of the remarkable Dineva formula, which corresponds to $s=0$ and gives $n/\varphi(n)$ on the right-hand side. We explain why only squarefree divisors are involved, show how multiplicativity naturally comes into play, and interpret the identity as a finite Euler product. Beyond this one-parameter family of generalizations, we describe a general method for constructing similar formulas and present several examples. Finally, we reformulate these identities in terms of partial zeta functions, thus emphasizing their close relationship with the classical theory of Euler products and the Riemann zeta function. The connection with the Selberg sieve is briefly outlined.</p></details>

The key innovation is a new approach to the computation of the $p$-divisibility index of certain special elements in Galois cohomology (the bottom class of a $Λ$-adic Euler system twisted by a character sufficiently close to the trivial character) based on a reformulation of the Iwasawa Main Conjectures in terms of determinants of Selmer complexes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be an abelian variety defined over a number field $\mathbb{Q}$, and let $\hat{h}$ be the Néron-Tate height on $A(\overline{\mathbb{Q}})$ corresponding to a symmetric ample line bundle on $A$. In this article, we prove that the Néron-Tate height of totally $p$-adic points is bounded below by an absolute constant depending only on $A$ for all but finitely many primes. In other words, if we denote by $\mathbb{Q}^{(p)}$ the maximal algebraic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ in which $p$ is totally split, then $A(\mathbb{Q}^{(p)})$ satisfies the Bogomolov property for all but finitely many primes. In particular, if $A$ has good reduction at a prime $p$, we obtain the Bogomolov property $A(\Q^{(p)})$. This is the first instance where such a result has been obtained in the good reduction case. In a more general setting, if $A/K$ is an abelian variety and $\mathcal{K}/K$ is an asymptotically positive extension as defined in \cite{AB-SK}, which includes infinite Galois extensions with finite local degree at a non-archimedean place, then $A(\mathcal{K})$ satisfies the Bogomolov property.</p></details>

We prove this correspondence in the cases associated to the group $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, and Riemann surfaces of genus zero with a number of punctures larger than three. A crucial ingredient is a unitary integral transformation mapping products of solutions to the ordinary differential equation associated to a real oper to eigenfunctions of the quantised Hitchin Hamiltonians. This allows us to construct joint eigenfunctions of Hecke operators and Hitchin Hamiltonians from real opers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $γ$-$\mathsf{GapSVP}_p$ be the decision version of the shortest vector problem in the $\ell_p$-norm with approximation factor $γ$, let $n$ be the lattice dimension and $0<\varepsilon\leq 1$. We prove that the following statements hold for infinitely many values of $p$. $(2-\varepsilon)$-$\mathsf{GapSVP}_p$ is not in $O\left(2^{O(p)}\cdot n^{O(1)}\right)$-time, unless $\text{P}=\text{NP}$. $(2-\varepsilon)$-$\mathsf{GapSVP}_p$ is not in $O\left(2^{2^{o(p)}}\cdot 2^{o(n)}\right)$-time, unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis is false. The proofs are based on a Karp reduction from a variant of the subset-sum problem that imposes restrictions on vectors orthogonal to the vector of its weights. While more extensive hardness results for the shortest vector problem in all $\ell_p$-norms have already been established under randomized reductions, the results in this paper are fully deterministic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a writeup of a resolution of Erdős Problem #728; this is the first Erdős problem (a problem proposed by Paul Erdős which has been collected in the Erdős Problems website) regarded as fully resolved autonomously by an AI system. The system in question is a combination of GPT-5.2 Pro by OpenAI and Aristotle by Harmonic, operated by Kevin Barreto. The final result of the system is a formal proof written in Lean, which we translate to informal mathematics in the present writeup for wider accessibility. The proved result is as follows. We show a logarithmic-gap phenomenon regarding factorial divisibility: For any constants $0<C_1<C_2$ and $0 < \varepsilon < 1/2$ there exist infinitely many triples $(a,b,n)\in\mathbb N^3$ with $\varepsilon n \le a,b \le (1-\varepsilon)n$ such that $$ a!\,b!\mid n!\,(a+b-n)!\qquad\text{and}\qquad C_1\log n < a+b-n < C_2\log n. $$ The argument reduces this to a binomial divisibility $\binom{m+k}{k}\mid\binom{2m}{m}$ and studies it prime-by-prime. By Kummer's theorem, $ν_p\binom{2m}{m}$ translates into a carry count for doubling $m$ in base $p$. We then employ a counting argument to find, in each scale $[M,2M]$, an integer $m$ whose base-$p$ expansions simultaneously force many carries when doubling $m$, for every prime $p\le 2k$, while avoiding the rare event that one of $m+1,\dots,m+k$ is divisible by an unusually high power of $p$. These "carry-rich but spike-free" choices of $m$ force the needed $p$-adic inequalities and the divisibility. The overall strategy is similar to results regarding divisors of $\binom{2n}{n}$ studied earlier by Erdős and by Pomerance.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A partition is a $t$-core partition if $t$ is not one of its hook lengths. Let $c_t(N)$ be the number of $t$-core partitions of $N$. In 1999, Stanton conjectured $c_t(N) \le c_{t+1}(N)$ if $4 \le t \ne N-1$. This was proved for $t$ fixed and $N$ sufficiently large by Anderson, and for small values of $t$ by Kim and Rouse. In this paper, we prove Stanton's conjecture in general. Our approach is to find a saddle point asymptotic formula for $c_t(N)$, valid in all ranges of $t$ and $N$. This includes the known asymptotic formulas for $c_t(N)$ as special cases, and shows that the behavior of $c_t(N)$ depends on how $t^2$ compares in size to $N$. For example, our formula implies that if $t^2 = κN + o(t)$, then $c_t(N) = \frac{\exp\left(2π\sqrt{A N}\right)}{B N} (1 + o(1))$ for suitable constants $A$ and $B$ defined in terms of $κ$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We answer a question of Serre from the 1980s on rational points of bounded height on projective thin sets, in degree at least $4$. For degrees $2$ and $3$ we improve the known bounds in general. The focus is on thin sets of type II, namely corresponding to the images of ramified dominant quasi-finite covers of projective space, as thin sets of type I are already well understood via dimension growth results by the third author in 2002 (published in 2023) by a global variant of Heath-Brown's $p$-adic determinant method. For type II, we obtain a uniform affine variant of Serre's question which implies the projective case and for which the implicit constant is furthermore polynomial in the degree. We are able to avoid logarithmic factors when the degree is at least $5$ and we prove our results over any global field, of any characteristic. A key ingredient for obtaining the affine variant comes from Binyamini-Cluckers-Novikov (2024) and Binyamini-Cluckers-Kato (2025) where a question of the third author was answered by providing bounds, for rational points on irreducible curves, which are quadratic in the degree. A second key ingredient is an adaptation of Salberger's global determinant method to the case of weighted polynomials. The third key ingredient is the design of our affine variant of Serre's question, for weighted polynomials which are not necessarily weighted homogeneous.</p></details>

The number of integers $n$ such that $f(n)$ is $k$-free is widely studied in the literature. In principle, one expects that $f(n)$ is $k$-free infinitely often, if $f$ has no fixed $k$-th power divisor. In 2022, Bergelson and Richter established a new dynamical generalization of the prime number theorem (PNT). Inspired by their work, one may expect that this generalization of the PNT also holds over integers of power-free polynomial values. In this note, we establish such variants of Bergelson and Richter's theorem for several polynomials studied by Estermann, Hooley, Heath-Brown, Booker and Browning.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the context of $p$-adic quantum mechanics, we investigate composite systems of $p$-adic qubits and $p$-adically controlled quantum logic gates. We build on the notion of a single $p$-adic qubit as a two-dimensional irreducible representation of the compact $p$-adic special orthogonal group SO(3)$_p$. We show that the classification of these representations reduces to the finite case, as they all factorise through some finite quotient SO(3)$_p$ mod $p^k$. Then, we tackle the problem of $p$-adic qubit composition and entanglement, fundamental for a $p$-adic formulation of quantum information processing. We classify the representations of SO(3)$_p$ mod $p$, and analyse tensor products of two $p$-adic qubit representations lifted from SO(3)$_p$ mod $p$. We solve the Clebsch-Gordan problem for such systems, revealing that the coupled bases decompose into singlet and doublet states. We further study entanglement arising from those stable subsystems. For $p=3$, we construct a set of gates from $4$-dimensional irreducible representations of SO(3)$_p$ mod $p$ that we prove to be universal for quantum computation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f:\mathbb{A}^N\to\mathbb{A}^N$ be a regular endomorphism of algebraic degree $d\geq2$ (i.e., $f$ extends to an endomorphism on $\mathbb{P}^N$ of algebraic degree $d$) defined over a number field. We prove that if the set of cyclotomic $f$-preperiodic points is Zariski-dense in $\mathbb{A}^N$, then some iterate $f^{\circ l}$ ($l\geq1$) is a quotient of a surjective algebraic group endomorphism $g:\mathbb{G}_m^N\to\mathbb{G}_m^N$, over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. This result generalizes a theorem of Dvornicich and Zannier on cyclotomic preperiodic points of one-variable polynomials to higher dimensions. In fact, we prove a much more general rigidity result for dominant endomorphisms $f$ on an affine variety $X$ defined over a number field, concerning "almost $f$-invariant" Zariski-dense subsets of cyclotomic integral points. We apply our results to backward orbits of regular endomorphisms on $\mathbb{A}^N$ of algebraic degree $d\geq2$, and to periodic points of automorphisms of Hénon type on $\mathbb{A}^N$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the symmetric multiple Eisenstein series, a variant of the multiple Eisenstein series. As a fundamental result, we show that they satisfy the linear shuffle relation. As a case study, we investigate the vector space spanned by symmetric double Eisenstein series of weight $k$. When $k$ is even, it coincides with the space spanned by modular forms of weight $k$ and the derivative of the Eisenstein series of weight $k-2$. For $k$ odd, we prove that its dimension equals $\lfloor k/3\rfloor$. We further provide an explicit correspondence between the linear shuffle relation and the Fay-shuffle relation satisfied by elliptic double zeta values, which may be of independent interest. In connection with modular forms, we prove that every modular form can be expressed as a linear combination of symmetric triple Eisenstein series. This will serve as a first step toward understanding modular phenomena for symmeric multiple zeta values observed by Kaneko and Zagier.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use the methods introduced by Lue Pan to study the locally analytic vectors of the completed cohomology of Shimura curves associated to an indefinite quaternion algebra $D$ which is ramified at a prime number $p$. Let $D_p^{\times}$ be the group of units of $D$ at $p$. Using $p$-adic uniformization of the quaternionic Shimura curves, we compute the Hecke eigenspace of the completed cohomology with the Hecke eigenvalues associated to a classical automorphic form on another quaternion algebra $\bar D$ (switching invariants of $D$ at $p,\infty$). We present this locally analytic $D_p^\times$-representation using the de Rham complex of the Lubin-Tate tower of dimension $1$. This is analogous to the Breuil-Strauch conjecture for the group $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. We show that the locally analytic $D_p^{\times}$-representation does not detect the Hodge filtration of the local de Rham Galois representation at $p$ in the crystalline case, and also give applications for the locally analytic Jacquet--Langlands correspondence for $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ and $D_p^\times$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a ring isomorphism between the derived Hall algebra of the Jordan quiver and the ring of double symmetric functions (i.e., the ring of symmetric polynomials in two sets of countably many variables, invariant under the respective actions of their symmetric groups) with a parameter $t$. This isomorphism maps the derived Hall basis (the natural basis of the derived Hall algebra) to a class of double Hall-Littlewood (HL) symmetric functions, which are formulated via raising and lowering operators. These double HL functions are parameterized by bipartitions; they reduce to the classical HL functions when one of the partitions is empty, and specialize to Schur Laurent symmetric functions at $t = 0$. We also derive the Pieri rules for these double HL functions. Additionally, we obtain several natural generating functions for the derived Hall algebra as well as their transition relations, which can be transferred to the ring of double symmetric functions via the established ring isomorphism.</p></details>

For example, we show that if $h \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$, then \begin{align*} \# \{n : n^3+h \in \square_{2}, \ 1 \leq n \leq x \} \gg x^{1/3-o(1)}. \end{align*} These arguments may be generalised to study the representation of irreducible monic cubic polynomials by the quadratic form $x^2+ny^2$, where $n \in \mathbb{N}$.</p></details>

The restriction remains integrable and decomposes into irreducible components with finite multiplicities, encoded by pairs of highest weights.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Tilting theory is one of the central tools in modern representation theory, in particular in the study of Cohen-Macaulay representations. We study Cohen-Macaulay representations of $\mathbb N$-graded Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras $A$ of dimension one, without assuming the connectedness condition. This framework covers a broad class of noncommutative Gorenstein rings, including classical $\mathbb N$-graded Gorenstein orders. We prove that the stable category $\underline{\mathsf{CM}}_0^{\mathbb Z}A$ admits a silting object if and only if $A_0$ has finite global dimension. In this case we give such a silting object explicitly. Assuming that $A$ is ring-indecomposable, we further show that $\underline{\mathsf{CM}}_0^{\mathbb Z}A$ admits a tilting object if and only if either $A$ is Artin-Schelter regular or the average Gorenstein parameter of $A$ is non-positive. These results generalize those of Buchweitz, Iyama, and Yamaura. We give two proofs of the second result: one via Orlov-type semiorthogonal decompositions, and the other via a direct calculation. As an application, we show that for a Gorenstein tiled order $A$, the category $\underline{\mathsf{CM}}^{\mathbb Z}A$ is equivalent to the derived category of the incidence algebra of an explicitly constructed poset. We also apply our results and Koszul duality to study smooth noncommutative projective quadric hypersurfaces $\mathsf{qgr}\,B$ of arbitrary dimension. We prove that $\mathsf{D}^{\mathrm b}(\mathsf{qgr}\,B)$ admits an explicitly constructed tilting object, which contains the tilting object of $\underline{\mathsf{CM}}^{\mathbb Z}B$ due to Smith and Van den Bergh as a direct summand via Orlov's semiorthogonal decomposition.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The mass transference principle of Beresnevich and Velani is a powerful mechanism for determining the Hausdorff dimension/measure of $\limsup$ sets that arise naturally in Diophantine approximation. However, in the setting of dynamical Diophantine approximation, this principle often fails to apply effectively, as the radii of the balls defining the dynamical $\limsup$ sets generally depend on the orbit of the point $x$ itself. In this paper, we develop a dimensional mass transference principle that enables us to recover and extend classical results on shrinking target problems, particularly for the $β$-transformation and the Gauss map. Moreover, our result shows that the corresponding $\limsup$ sets have large intersection properties. A potentially interesting feature of our method is that, in many cases, shrinking target problems are closely related to finding an appropriate Gibbs measure, which may reveal new aspects of the link between thermodynamic formalism and dynamical Diophantine approximation.</p></details>

Here we use a different approach, which allows us to obtain another generalisation of this result to polynomials with coefficients from small subgroups of $\mathbb F_q^*$. As a demonstration of the power of our approach, we also use it to count such irreducible polynomials with an additional condition, namely, with a prescribed value of their discriminant. This generalisation seems to be unachievable via the approach of L. Bary-Soroker and R. Shmueli (2026).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We obtain new infinite families of identities among special values of Dirichlet $L$-functions using finite spectral sums. More precisely, we study Dirichlet $L$-functions via discrete analogues $L_n$ arising from the spectral theory of cyclic graphs as $n\rightarrow \infty$. Applying a refined Euler-Maclaurin asymptotic expansion due to Sidi, together with an independent polynomiality property of these finite spectral sums at integers, we obtain exact special-value formulas, even starting at $n=1$. This yields new expressions for certain trigonometric sums of interest in physics, and recovers, by a different method, the striking formulas of Xie, Zhao, and Zhao. Concerning zeros, using the same asymptotic expansion, we prove that for odd primitive characters, an asymptotic functional equation relating $L_n(1-s,\overline{χ})$ to $L_n(s,χ)$ is equivalent to the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for the corresponding Dirichlet $L$-function $L(s,χ)$. We also provide some remarks about the non-existence of possible real zeros.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A set $\mathcal S\subset \mathbb N$ is said to be a subset-sum-distinct or dissociated if all of its finite subsets have different sums. Alternately, an equivalent classification is if any equality of the form $$\sum_{s\in \mathcal S} \varepsilon_s \cdot s =0$$ where $\varepsilon_s \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ implies that all the $\varepsilon_s$'s are $0$. For a dissociated set $\mathcal S$, we prove that for $c_\ast = \frac 12 \log_2 \left(\frac π2\right)$ and any $c_\ast-1<C<c_\ast$, we have $$\mathcal S(n) \,:=\, \mathcal S\cap [1,n] \,\le\, \log_2 n +\frac 12 \log_2\log_2 n + C$$ for all $n\in \mathcal N_C$ with asymptotic density $\mathbf d\left(\mathcal N_C\right)=2-2^{c_\ast-C}$. Further, we consider the greedy algorithm for generating these sets and prove that this algorithm always eventually doubles. Finally, we also consider some generalizations of dissociated sets and prove similar results about them.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let Y be a random variable whose moment-generating function exists in some neighborhood of the origin. While probabilistic Stirling numbers of the first and second kind have been introduced, early definitions often failed to satisfy fundamental orthogonality and inverse relations or lacked consistency with classical forms in the case when Y = 1. This paper addresses these limitations by utilizing redefined probabilistic Stirling numbers of the first kind and the second kind alongside their degenerate counterparts. Our primary objective is twofold: first,to introduce the probabilistic (degenerate) logarithm associated with Y, providing explicit expressions for various random variables and defining new probabilistic degenerate Daehee and Cauchy numbers; and second, to investigate probabilistic heterogeneous Stirling numbers and establish a probabilistic degenerate version of the Schlomilch formula, demonstrating that these new frameworks maintain the essential algebraic properties of their classical counterparts.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study finite-rank left-translation invariant algebraic $D$-modules on complex affine algebraic groups. Using the standard description of these objects as left-invariant flat algebraic connections on the trivial vector bundle, modulo algebraic gauge transformations, we recast the classification problem as an explicit moduli problem for constant connections. Our main results treat the semisimple case and the general linear case. For a connected semisimple complex algebraic group, invariant $D$-modules are classified by representations of the finite central kernel of the simply connected cover, yielding an equivalence of tensor categories. For a general linear group, every invariant $D$-module is obtained by pullback along the determinant map, reducing the classification to the one-dimensional torus case and inducing a tensor equivalence with the corresponding invariant category on the torus.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 14 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>I investigate structural limitations of Presburger-arithmetic-based approaches to the Collatz problem. I show that the Collatz cycle equation admits a unique solution in the $2$-adic integers, which I term a \emph{ghost cycle}. These ghost cycles are shown to be genuine periodic orbits of the $2$-adic Collatz map, satisfying all local parity constraints. I prove unconditionally that the divisibility predicate $\mathcal{D}_y = \{(x, C) \in \mathbb{N}^2: (2^x - 3^y) \mid C\}$, which acts as the algebraic necessary condition for integrality, is not semilinear for any fixed number of odd steps $y \ge 1$. This result is established by demonstrating that the fibers of $\mathcal{D}_y$ exhibit unbounded periods, an obstruction to Presburger definability. Consequently, strategies relying solely on Presburger arithmetic or finite automata to define the integrality constraint cannot capture the distinction between ghost cycles and genuine integer cycles. I conclude with a heuristic argument suggesting that because ghost cycles satisfy the algebraic cycle equation, the non-existence of integer cycles cannot be proven solely through algebraic manipulation of the cycle equation itself.</p></details>

Our approach is truly elementary, relying on generating function manipulations, theta functions and $q$-dissection techniques. We then close by demonstrating an infinite family of congruences modulo 11 which is proven using a result of Ahlgren.</p></details>

Let $f(x)\in K_0[x]$ be a degree $n$ monic polynomial without repeated roots, and $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ a smooth projective model of the affine curve $y^d=f(x)$. Let $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$ be the Jacobian of the $K_0$-curve $\mathcal{C}_{f,d} $. As usual, we identify $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ with its canonical image in $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$ (such that the only ``infinite point'' of $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ goes to the zero of the group law on $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$). We say that an integer $m>1$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K_0$ if there exists a polynomial $f(x)$ as above such that $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}(K_0)$ contains a torsion point of order $m$. Let us put $\ell_0:=[(n+d)/d], \ m_0:=\ell_0 d$. Earlier we proved that if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable, then either $m=d$ or $m = n$ or $m \ge m_0$ (in addition, both $d$ and $n$ are $(n,d)$-reachable over every $K_0$). We also proved that if $m_0$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over some $K_0$ then $n-m_0+\ell_0\ge 0$. In the present paper we discuss the $(n,d)$-reachability of $m_0$ when $n-m_0+\ell_0=0$ or $1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An ideal setting to exhibit infinite sets of primes $p$ relative to which an integer is a primitive root $\pmod p$ is provided by the Bézout subdomain $\widetilde{\mathbb{B}}:=\mathbb{Z}^{\mathbb{P}}/\mathfrak{U}$ of the valuation domain $\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}=\prod_{\mathfrak{U}} \mathbb{Z}_p$ with respect to a nonprincipal ultrafilter $\mathfrak{U}$ on $\mathbb{P}$, extant via Chebotarev's theorem and the ultrafilter theorem and such that the relative algebraic closure $\mathbb{L}:=\mathrm{Abs}(\widetilde{\mathbb{Q}})$ of the prime field of the valued field $\widetilde{\mathbb{Q}}=\prod_{\mathfrak{U}} \mathbb{Q}_p$ contains $\sqrt{-\tilde p}$ for $p\in\mathbb{P}$, contains no $\sqrt[3]{\tilde q}$ for $q\in\mathbb{P}$, and has $\mathrm{tor}(\mathbb{L}^\times)=\langle ζ_6\rangle$. Results include positive resolutions of the conjectured infinitude of primes $p$ for which (i) $\frac{p-1}{6}$ is prime and (ii) a non-perfect-square $-1\neq m\in\mathbb{Z}$ is a primitive root $\pmod p$, establishing as manifest the efficacy of ultraproduct treatments in resolving number theory problems requiring certification of countably infinite conforming sets. Furthermore, we extend these results to the quantitative regime by identifying the primitive-root indicator as a projection in the $C^\ast$-algebra $\ell^\infty(\mathbb{P})$. We prove that the Bézout rigidity of $\widetilde{\mathbb{B}}$ and the $\mathbf{\tildeν}$-anchor enforce the normality of the density state, thereby algebraically precluding ``spectral leakage'' into the infinite tail of Kummer obstructions. This provides a structural, GRH-free proof that the natural density exists as the vacuum expectation value in a GNS representation: $δ_m=ω_δ(f_m)= c_m\prod_{q\in\mathbb{P}}(1-\frac{1}{q(q-1)})$ where $\prod_{q\in\mathbb{P}}(1-\frac{1}{q(q-1)})$ is the Artin Euler product.</p></details>

As a corollary, we show that for all $\varepsilon>0$, there exists an effectively computable constant $c>0$ depending only on $(n,n',[F:\mathbb{Q}],\varepsilon)$ such that $L(s,π\timesπ')$ has at most one zero (necessarily simple) in the region $$ \mathrm{Re}(s)\geq 1-c/(C(π)C(π')(|\mathrm{Im}(s)|+1))^{\varepsilon}, $$ where $C(π)$ and $C(π')$ are the analytic conductors. A crucial component of our proof is a new standard zero-free region for any twist of $L(s,π\times\widetildeπ)$ by an idele class character $χ$ apart from a possible single exceptional zero (necessarily real and simple) that can occur only when $π\otimesχ^2=π$.

In this article, we establish a central limit theorem for the number of summands in such partitions when $f(n)=σ_r(n)$ denotes the generalised divisor function, defined as $σ_r(n)=\sum_{d|n}d^r$ for integer $r\geq 2$. This can be considered as a generalisation of the work of Lipnik, Madritsch, and Tichy, who previously studied this problem for $f(n)=\lfloor{n}^α\rfloor$ with $0<α<1$. A key element of our proof relies on the analytic behaviour of the Dirichlet series \begin{align*} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{σ_r(n+1)}{n^s}, \end{align*} for $\mathrm{Re}(s)>1$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we compute the multiplicities appearing in the ${\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell}$-modular theta correspondence in type II over a non-archimedean field $\mathrm{F}$, where $\ell$ is a prime not dividing the residue cardinality of $\mathrm{F}$. Unlike for representations with complex coefficients, highly non-trivial multiplicities can emerge. We show that these multiplicities are precisely governed by the action of symmetric groups on the set of partial permutations, and the ${\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell}$-representation of symmetric groups these give rise to. The problem is thus reduced to certain branching problems in the modular representation theory of symmetric groups. In particular, if $d$ is the order of the residue cardinality of $\mathrm{F}$ in ${\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell}$, and the rank of the involved general linear groups is bounded above by $ d\ell$, the behavior of the theta correspondence can be predicted via explicit algorithms coming from Pieri's Formula.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve and $p$ an odd prime. In 1991 Kolyvagin conjectured that the system of cohomology classes for torsion quotients of the $p$-adic Tate module of $E$ derived from Heegner points over ring class fields of a suitable imaginary quadratic field $K$ (i.e., the Heegner point Kolyvagin system of $E/K$) is non-trivial. In this paper we prove Kolyvagin's conjecture when $p$ is a prime of good ordinary reduction for $E$ that splits in $K$. In particular, our results cover many cases where $p$ is an Eisenstein prime for $E$, complementing Wei Zhang's earlier results on the conjecture by a different approach. Our methods also yield a proof of a refinement of Kolyvagin's conjecture expressing the divisibility index of the Heegner point Kolyvagin system in terms of the Tamagawa numbers of $E$, as conjectured by Wei Zhang in 2014, as well as proofs of analogous results for the Kolyvagin system obtained from Kato's Euler system.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a permutation $w$ in the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_{n}$, let $L(w)$ denote the simple highest weight module in the principal block of the BGG category $\mathcal{O}$ for the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_{n}(\mathbb{C})$. We first prove that $L(w)$ is Kostant negative whenever $w$ consecutively contains certain patterns. We then provide a complete answer to Kostant's problem in type $A_{6}$ and show that the indecomposability conjecture also holds in type $A_{6}$, that is, applying an indecomposable projective functor to a simple module outputs either an indecomposable module or zero.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We take the first step toward a structure theory that includes both operations of a ring $\mathcal{R}$. More precisely, we prove a series of inverse results for the structure of sets $A\subseteq \mathbf{F}_p$ such that, under certain conditions on integers $r_1, \dots, r_k$, one has $|A^{r_1} + \dots + A^{r_k}| \ll \sqrt[k]{p^{k-1} |A|}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 35 pages; minor errors corrected

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define and study a biadditive symmetric (not necessarily perfect) pairing on the torsion part $\mathrm{Pic}(X)_{\mathrm{tors}}$ of the Picard group of a smooth projective curve $X$ over a field $k$ with values in $k^\times \otimes \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$. We call its kernel the intrinsic subgroup of $X$. It turns out that some information on the reduction type of $X$ can be read off from the intrinsic subgroup. Mazur's torsion theorem says that there are exactly 15 isomorphism classes of abelian groups that appear as the rational torsion points of an elliptic curve $X$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ (identified with $\mathrm{Pic}(X)_{\mathrm{tors}}$). We refine this result by determining which subgroups of those 15 groups appear as the intrinsic subgroups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v3: Upgraded math content, including the proofs of rank r=1 (quasi-regularity). Also with minor changes in the exposition

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that any symplectic singularity lying on a smoothable projective symplectic variety locally admits a good action of an algebraic torus of dimension $r \geq 1$, which is canonical. Under mild assumptions, $r=1$ is also confirmed. In particular, it admits (canonical) good $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This proves Kaledin's conjecture conditionally but in a substantially stronger form. Our key idea is to use Donaldson-Sun theory on local Kahler metrics in complex differential geometry to connect with the theory of Poisson deformations of symplectic varieties. For general symplectic singularities, we prove the same assertion -- namely, the existence of a canonical (local) torus action -- assuming that the Donaldson-Sun theory extends to such singularities along with suitable singular (hyper)Kahler metrics. Conversely, our results can be also used to study local behaviour of such metrics around the germ. For instance, we show that such singular hyperKahler metric around isolated singularity is close to a metric cone in a polynomial order, and satisfies $r=1$ i.e., has a good canonical (local) $\mathbb{C}^*$-action, as the complexification of the cone metric rescaling. Our theory also fits well to singularities on many hyperKahler reductions.</p></details>
