### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18285v2'>2508.18285</a>\]&nbsp; **An average Brun-Titchmarsh theorem and shifted primes with a large prime factor**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Runbo Li &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The author studies an average version of Brun-Titchmarsh theorem with large moduli. Using Maynard's recent breakthrough on the Bombieri-Friedlander-Iwaniec type triple convolution estimates, we refine the previous result of Baker and Harman (1996). As an application, we improve a result of Baker and Harman (1998) on shifted primes with a large prime factor, showing that the largest prime factor of $p - 1$ is larger than $p^{0.679}$ for infinitely many primes $p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A strong Gelfand pair $(G,H)$ is a finite group $G$ together with a subgroup $H$ such that every irreducible character of $H$ induces to a multiplicity-free character of $G$. We classify the strong Gelfand pairs of the finite symplectic groups ${\rm Sp}_4(q)$ for even $q$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Moubariz Z. Garaev, Julio C. Pardo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a large prime number. We prove that any integer $\lambda$ modulo $p$ can be represented in the form $$ m!n! +\sum_{i=1}^{47}n_i!\equiv \lambda \pmod p, $$ with $\max\{m,n,n_1,\ldots,n_{47}\}\ll p^{1300/1301}.$ This improves the exponent $1350/1351$ of Garaev, Luca and Shparlinski (2005). Furthermore, we prove that any integer $\lambda$ can be represented in the form $$ m_1!n_1! +m_2!n_2!+m_3!n_3! +m_4!n_4!+m_5!n_5! \equiv \lambda \pmod p $$ with $\max\{m_1,n_1,\ldots,m_5,n_5\}\le p^{97/113 +o(1)}.$ This improves the exponent $27/28$ of Garaev and Garcia (2007). The proofs of these two results are based on the recent work of Grebennikov, Sagdeev, Semchankau and Vasilevskii (2024). We also obtain some lower bound estimates on the cardinality of the product set of two factorials modulo a prime. For instance, we prove that if $N<p^{3/5},$ then $$ \#\{m!n!\pmod p; \, 1\le m,n\le N\}\gg N^{1-o(1)}. $$ The proof of this result is based on works of Banks and Shparlinski (2020), Cilleruelo and Garaev (2016), and the work of Katz and Shen (2008) related to the Ruzsa-Pl\"unnecke inequality from additive combinatorics.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12311v2'>2412.12311</a>\]&nbsp; **Conditional Bounds for Prime Gaps with Applications**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jacques Grah &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 31 pages, new section 9 deals with twin prime conjecture

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We posit that $d_n^2 < 2p_{n+1}$ holds for all $n\geq 1$, where $p_n$ represents the $n$th prime and $d_n$ stands for the $n$th prime gap i.e. $d_n := p_{n+1} - p_n$. Then, the presence of a prime between successive perfect squares, as well as the validity of $\Delta_n := \sqrt{p_{n+1}} - \sqrt{p_n} < 1$ are derived. Next, $\pi(x)$ being the number of primes $p$ up to $x$, we deduce $\pi(n^2-n) < \pi(n^2) < \pi(n^2+n)$ $(n\geq 2)$. In addition, a proof of $\pi((n+1)^k) - \pi(n^k) \geq \pi(2^k)$ \ $(k\geq 2, n\geq 1)$ is worked out. The vanishing nature of $\Delta_n$ as $n$ goes to infinity is set, and used afterwards to achieve both $\displaystyle{\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}d_n/\sqrt{p_n} = 0}$ and the twin prime conjecture. Also, question about the estimate $p_n < 2j_n^2 \ (n\geq 6)$, where $j_n$ counts the twin prime pairs up to $p_n$, is raised. Finally, we put forward the conjecture that any rational number $r$ $(0\leq r \leq 1)$ represents an accumulation point of the sequence $\left(\{\sqrt{p_n}\}\right)_{n\geq 1}$, where $\{x\}$ acts for the fractional part of $x$.</p></details>
