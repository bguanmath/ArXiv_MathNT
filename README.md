### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14971v1'>2510.14971</a>\]&nbsp; **On the invariants of finite groups arising in a topological quantum field theory**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Christopher A. Schroeder, Hung P. Tong-Viet &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we consider the properties of finite groups that are witnessed by group invariants arising in the context of Dijkgraaf--Witten theory, a topological quantum field theory, as invariants of surfaces. These invariants can be considered generalizations of the commuting probability, an invariant that has been well studied in the group theory literature.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00870v2'>2510.00870</a>\]&nbsp; **On three classes of logarithmic integrals**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Necdet Batır, Nandan Sai Dasireddy &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we evaluate the following families of definite integrals in closed form and we show that they are expressible only in terms of the dilogarithm function and the inverse tangent integral, and elementary functions. \begin{equation*} \int_{0}^{1}\frac{\log\big(x^m+1\big)}{x+1}\thinspace{\rm d}x \quad \mbox{and}\quad \int_{0}^{1}\frac{\log\big(x^m+1\big)}{x^2+1}\thinspace{\rm d}x, \end{equation*} where $m$ is a positive odd integer. When $m$ is a positive even integer, these integrals have been evaluated previously by Sofo and Bat{\i}r, and the case where $m$ is an odd integer has been left as open problems. The integrals of the first kind arise in Zagier's work on the Kronecker limit formula. In addition, we demonstrate that a functional equation satisfied by the Herglotz-Zagier-Novikov function is a very specific case of of a more general formula, and give numerous illustrative examples.</p></details>

> **Comment:** In v2 conditions are weakened, examples are expanded upon, the proof is refined and other improvements are made

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study Dirichlet series arising as linear functionals on an inner product space of meromorphic functions and establish a relation between the discontinuities of the former on the boundary and the poles and zeros of the latter on the imaginary axis. As an example application of Delange's Tauberian theorem, it is shown that the conjectured asymptotic in the additive divisor problem follows conditionally on the non-vanishing of a certain meromorphic function and its first derivative on the imaginary axis.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02147v4'>2510.02147</a>\]&nbsp; **On RoCK blocks of double covers of symmetric and alternating groups and the refined Broué conjecture**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yucong Du, Xin Huang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Kleshchev and Livesey proved the existence of RoCK $p$-blocks for double covers of symmetric and alternating groups over large enough coefficient rings. They proved that RoCK blocks of double covers are Morita equivalent to standard ``local" blocks via bimodules with endopermutation source. Based on this, Kleshchev and Livesey proved that these RoCK blocks are splendidly Rickard equivalent to their Brauer correspondents. The analogous result for blocks of symmetric groups, a theorem of Chuang and Kessar, was an important step in Chuang and Rouquier ultimately proving Brou\'e's abelian defect group conjecture for symmetric groups. In this paper we show that in most cases the Morita and splendid Rickard equivalences constructed by Kleshchev and Livesey descend to the ring $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p$-adic integers, hence prove Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'e's abelian defect group conjecture for most of these RoCK blocks.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 46 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given any vertex operator algebra $ V $ with an automorphism $ g $, we derive a Jacobi identity for an intertwining operator $ \mathcal{Y} $ of type $ \left( \begin{smallmatrix} W_3\\ W_1 \, W_2 \end{smallmatrix}\right) $ when $ W_1 $ is an untwisted $ V $-module, and $ W_2 $ and $ W_3 $ are $ g $-twisted $ V $-modules. We say such an intertwining operator is of $\left(\!\begin{smallmatrix} g\\ 1 \ g \end{smallmatrix}\!\right)$-type. Using the Jacobi identity, we obtain homogeneous linear differential equations satisfied by the multi-series $ \langle w_0, \mathcal{Y}_1(w_1,z_1) \cdots \mathcal{Y}_N(w_N,z_N) w_{N+1} \rangle $ when $ \mathcal{Y}_j $ are of $\left(\!\begin{smallmatrix} g\\ 1 \ g \end{smallmatrix}\!\right)$-type and the modules are $ C_1 $-cofinite and discretely graded. In the special case that $ V $ is an affine vertex operator algebra, we derive the ``twisted KZ equations" and show that its solutions have regular singularities at certain prescribed points when $ g $ has finite order. When $ V $ is general and $ g $ has finite order, we use the theory of regular singular points to prove that the multi-series $ \langle w_0, \mathcal{Y}_1(w_1,z_1) \cdots \mathcal{Y}_N(w_N,z_N) w_{N+1} \rangle $ converges absolutely to a multivalued analytic function when $ |z_1| > \cdots > |z_N| > 0 $ and analytically extends to the region $ z_i, z_i - z_j \neq 0 $. Furthermore, when $ N = 2 $, we show that these multivalued functions have regular singularities at certain prescribed points.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we study the existence and distribution of elements in finite field extensions with prescribed traces in several intermediate extensions that are also either normal or primitive normal. In the former case, we fully characterize the conditions under which such elements exist and provide an explicit enumeration of these elements. In the latter case we provide asymptotic results.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13283v3'>2411.13283</a>\]&nbsp; **On compatibility of Koszul- and higher preprojective gradings**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Darius Dramburg, Mads Hustad Sandøy &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 25 pages. Corrected section 5.3, added an acyclicity assumption

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate compatibility of gradings for an almost Koszul or Koszul algebra $R$ that is also the higher preprojective algebra $\Pi_{n+1}(A)$ of an $n$-hereditary algebra $A$. For an $n$-representation finite algebra $A$, we show that $A$ must be Koszul if $\Pi_{n+1}(A)$ can be endowed with an almost Koszul grading. For an acyclic basic $n$-representation infinite algebra $A$, we show that $A$ must be Koszul if $\Pi_{n+1}(A)$ can be endowed with a Koszul grading. From this we deduce that a higher preprojective grading of an (almost) Koszul algebra $R = \Pi_{n+1}(A)$ is, in both cases, isomorphic to a cut of the (almost) Koszul grading. Up to a further assumption on the tops of the degree $0$ subalgebras for the different gradings, we also show a similar result without the basic assumption in the $n$-representation infinite case. As an application, we show that $n$-APR tilting preserves the property of being Koszul for $n$-representation infinite algebras.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07659v6'>2403.07659</a>\]&nbsp; **The power operation in the Galois cohomology of a reductive group over a number field**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Mikhail Borovoi, Zinovy Reichstein, Philippe Gille &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** V.1: 52 pages. V.3: 61 pages. V.4: 37 pages. V.5: 42 pages, with an appendix by Philippe Gille. V.6: 43 pages, with appendices by M. Borovoi and P. Gille

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a connected reductive group $G$ over a local or global field $K$, we define a *diamond* (or *power*) operation $$(\xi,n)\mapsto \xi^{\Diamond n}\,\colon\, H^1(K,G)\times {\mathbb Z}\to H^1(K,G)$$ of raising to power $n$ in the Galois cohomology pointed set (this operation is new when $K$ is a number field). We show that this power operation has many good properties. When $G$ is a torus, the set $H^1(K,G)$ has a natural group structure, and $\xi^{\Diamond n}$ then coincides with the $n$-th power of $\xi$ in this group. On the other hand, we show that a power operation on $H^1(K,G)$, functorial in $G$, which we define over local and global fields, cannot be defined for an arbitrary field $K$. Our proof of this assertion relies on the results of Appendix B written by Philippe Gille. Using this power operation, for a cohomology class $\xi$ in $H^1(K,G)$ over local or global field, we define the period ${\rm per}(\xi)$ to be the least integer $n\ge 1$ such that $\xi^{\Diamond n}=1$. We define the index ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of the degrees $[L:K]$ of finite extensions $L/K$ splitting $\xi$. The period and index of a cohomology class generalize the period and index a central simple algebra over $K$. For any connected reductive group $G$ defined over a local or global field $K$, we show that ${\rm per}(\xi)$ divides ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ and that ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ may be strictly greater than ${\rm per}(\xi)$, but they always have the same prime factors.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Brian Lawrence, Will Sawin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 121 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Faltings proved that there are finitely many abelian varieties of genus $g$ over a number field $K$, with good reduction outside a finite set of primes $S$. Fixing one of these abelian varieties $A$, we prove that there are finitely many smooth hypersurfaces in $A$, with good reduction outside $S$, representing a given ample class in the N\'eron-Severi group of $A$, up to translation, as long as the dimension of $A$ is at least $4$. Our approach builds on the approach of arXiv:1807.02721 which studies $p$-adic variations of Hodge structure to turn finiteness results for $p$-adic Galois representations into geometric finiteness statements. A key new ingredient is an approach to proving big monodromy for the variations of Hodge structure arising from the middle cohomology of these hypersurfaces using the Tannakian theory of sheaf convolution on abelian varieties.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages, 7 tables

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A character table $X$ for a saturated fusion system $\mathcal{F}$ on a finite $p$-group $S$ is the square matrix of values associated to a basis of virtual $\mathcal{F}$-stable ordinary characters of $S$. We investigate a conjecture of the second author which equates the $p$-part of $|$det$(X)|^2$ with the product of the orders of $S$-centralisers of fully $\mathcal{F}$-centralised $\mathcal{F}$-class representatives. This statement is exactly column orthogonality for the character table of $S$ when $\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{F}_S(S)$. We prove the conjecture when $\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{F}_S(G)$ is realised by some finite group $G$ with Sylow $p$-subgroup $S$, and for all simple fusion systems when $|S| \le p^4$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Charles L. Samuels &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A 2009 article of Allcock and Vaaler explored the $\mathbb Q$-vector space $\mathcal G := \overline{\mathbb Q}^\times/{\overline{\mathbb Q}^\times_{\mathrm{tors}}}$, showing how to represent it as part of a function space on the places of $\overline{\mathbb Q}$. We establish a representation theorem for the $\mathbb R$-vector space of $\mathbb Q$-linear maps from $\mathcal G$ to $\mathbb R$, enabling us to classify extensions to $\mathcal G$ of completely additive arithmetic functions. We further outline a strategy to construct $\mathbb Q$-linear maps from $\mathcal G$ to $\mathbb Q$, i.e., elements of the algebraic dual of $\mathcal G$. Our results make heavy use of Dirichlet's $S$-unit Theorem as well as a measure-like object called a consistent map, first introduced by the author in previous work.</p></details>

> **Comment:** added new results on uniform bounds over semi-global fields

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a $(0,p)$-mixed characteristic complete discrete valued field $\mathcal{K}$ we define a class of finite field extensions called \emph{pseudo-perfect} extensions such that the natural restriction map on the mod-$p$ Milnor $K$-groups is trivial for all $p\neq 2$. This implies that pseudo-perfect extensions split every element in $H^i(\mathcal{K},\mu_p^{\otimes i-1})$ yielding period-index bounds for Brauer classes as well as higher cohomology classes of $\mathcal{K}$. As a corollary, we prove a conjecture of Bhaskhar-Haase that the Brauer $p$-dimension of $\mathcal{K}$ is upper bounded by $n+1$ where $n$ is the $p$-rank of the residue field. When $\mathcal{K}$ is the fraction field of a complete regular ring, we show that any $p$-torsion element in $Br(\mathcal{K})$ that is nicely ramified is split by a pseudo-perfect extension yielding a bound on its index. We then use patching techniques of Harbater, Hartmann and Krashen to show that the Brauer $p$-dimension of semi-global fields of residual characteristic $p$ is at most $n+2$ and also give uniform $p$-bounds for higher cohomologies. These bounds are sharper than previously known in the work of Parimala-Suresh</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $L/K$ be any finite separable extension with normal closure $\widetilde{L}/K$. An extension $L'/K$ is said to be $\textit{parallel to $L/K$}$ if $L'$ is an intermediate field of $\widetilde{L}/K$ with $[L':K]=[L:K]$. We study the following question -- Given that $L/K$ admits a Hopf--Galois structure of type $N$, does it imply that every extension parallel to $L/K$ also admits a Hopf--Galois structure of type $N$? We completely solve this problem when the degree $[L:K]$ is a prime power and the type $N$ is cyclic. Our approach is group-theoretic and uses the work of Greither--Pareigis and Byott.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study rational iterated preimages of the origin under unicritical maps $f_{d,c}(x)=x^d+c$. Earlier works of Faber--Hutz--Stoll and Hutz--Hyde--Krause established finiteness and conditional bounds in the quadratic case. Building on this, we prove that for $d=2$ and $c \in \mathbb Q\setminus\{0,-1\}$ there are no rational fourth preimages of the origin, and for all $d \geq 3$ there are no rational second preimages outside trivial cases. The proof relies on geometric analysis of preimage curves, the elliptic Chabauty method, and Diophantine reduction. As a result, we determine the number of rational iterated preimages of $0$ under $f_{d,c}$ for all $d\geq 2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study representations of finite groups on Stanley--Reisner rings of simplicial complexes and on lattice points in lattice polytopes. The framework of translative group actions allows us to use the theory of proper colorings of simplicial complexes without requiring an explicit coloring to be given. We prove that the equivariant Hilbert series of a Cohen--Macaulay simplicial complex under a translative group action admits a rational expression whose numerator is a positive integer combination of irreducible characters. This implies an analogous rational expression for the equivariant Ehrhart series of a lattice polytope with a unimodular triangulation that is invariant under a translative group action. As an application, we study the equivariant Ehrhart series of alcoved polytopes in the sense of Lam and Postnikov and derive explicit results in the case of order polytopes and of Lipschitz poset polytopes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be an abelian variety defined over a global function field $F$, and let $p$ be a prime distinct from the characteristic of $F$. Let $F_\infty$ be a $p$-adic Lie extension of $F$ that contains the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension $F^{\mathrm{cyc}}$ of $F$. In this paper, we investigate the structure of the $p$-primary Selmer group $\mathrm{Sel}(A/F_\infty)$ of $A$ over $F_\infty$. We prove the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-conjecture for $A/F_\infty$. Furthermore, we show that both the $\mu$-invariant of the Pontryagin dual of the Selmer group $\mathrm{Sel}(A/F^\mathrm{cyc})$ and the generalised $\mu$-invariant of the Pontryagin dual of the Selmer group $\mathrm{Sel}(A/F_\infty)$ are zero, therby proving Mazur's conjecture for $A/F$. We then relate the order of vanishing of the characteristic elements, evaluated at Artin representations, to the corank of the Selmer group of the corresponding twist of $A$ over the base field $F$. Assuming the finiteness of the Tate-Shafarevich group, we establish that this corank equals the order of vanishing of the $L$-function of $A/F$ at $s=1$. Finally, we extend a theorem of Sechi - originally proved for elliptic curves without complex multiplication - to abelian varieties over global function fields. This is achieved by adapting the notion of generalised Euler characteristic, introduced by Zerbes for elliptic curves over number fields. This new invariant allows us, via Akashi series, to relate the generalised Euler characteristic of $\mathrm{Sel}(A/F_\infty)$ to the Euler characteristic of $\mathrm{Sel}(A/F^{\mathrm{cyc}})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A function from $\Bbb F_{2^n}$ to $\Bbb F_{2^n}$ is said to be {\em $k$th order sum-free} if the sum of its values over each $k$-dimensional $\Bbb F_2$-affine subspace of $\Bbb F_{2^n}$ is nonzero. This notion was recently introduced by C. Carlet as, among other things, a generalization of APN functions. At the center of this new topic is a conjecture about the sum-freedom of the multiplicative inverse function $f_{\text{\rm inv}}(x)=x^{-1}$ (with $0^{-1}$ defined to be $0$). It is known that $f_{\text{\rm inv}}$ is 2nd order (equivalently, $(n-2)$th order) sum-free if and only if $n$ is odd, and it is conjectured that for $3\le k\le n-3$, $f_{\text{\rm inv}}$ is never $k$th order sum-free. The conjecture has been confirmed for even $n$ but remains open for odd $n$. In the present paper, we show that the conjecture holds under each of the following conditions: (1) $n=13$; (2) $3\mid n$; (3) $5\mid n$; (4) the smallest prime divisor $l$ of $n$ satisfies $(l-1)(l+2)\le (n+1)/2$. We also determine the ``right'' $q$-ary generalization of the binary multiplicative inverse function $f_{\text{\rm inv}}$ in the context of sum-freedom. This $q$-ary generalization not only maintains most results for its binary version, but also exhibits some extraordinary phenomena that are not observed in the binary case.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 33 pages; included more motivating exposition for the choice of weights

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Katz and Sarnak conjectured that the behavior of zeros near the central point of any family of $L$-functions is well-modeled by the behavior of eigenvalues near $1$ of some classical compact group (either the symplectic, unitary, or even, odd, or full orthogonal group). In 2018, Knightly and Reno proved that the symmetry group can vary depending on how the $L$-functions in the family are weighted. They observed both orthogonal and symplectic symmetry in the one-level densities of families of cuspidal newform $L$-functions for different choices of weights. We observe the same dependence of symmetry on weights in the $n^{\text{th}}$ centered moments of these one-level densities, for smooth test functions whose Fourier transforms are supported in $\left(-\frac{1}{2n}, \frac{1}{2n}\right)$. To treat the new terms that emerge in our $n$-level calculations when $n>1$, i.e., the cross terms that emerge from $n$-fold products of primes rather than individual primes, we generalize Knightly and Reno's weighted trace formula from primes to arbitrary positive integers. We then perform a delicate analysis of these cross terms to distinguish their contributions to the main and error terms of the $n^{\text{th}}$ centered moments. The final novelty here is an elementary combinatorial trick that we use to rewrite the main number theoretic terms arising from our analysis, facilitating comparisons with random matrix theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this short paper, we aim at giving a more conceptual and simpler proof of Rumely's moduli theoretic characterization of type II minimal locus of the resultant function $\mathrm{ordRes}_\phi$ on the Berkovich hyperbolic space for a rational function $\phi$ on $\mathbb{P}^1$ defined over an algebraically closed and complete field that is equipped with a non-trivial and non-archimedean absolute value, and also aim at giving a much simpler and more natural proof of a degenerating limit theorem, in an improved form after DeMarco--Faber, for the family of the unique maximal entropy measures on $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$ associated to a meromorphic family of complex rational functions. We introduce the intrinsic reduction of a non-archimedean rational function $\phi$ at each point in the Berkovich projective line and its directionwise intrinsic depths, which are suitable notions for the above aims and defined in terms of the tree and analytic structures of the Berkovich projective line.

To achieve our goal, we prove the existence of homomorphisms, which can be understood as generalization of Dorey rule to KR modules. We also conjecture a uniform denominator formulas for all simply-laced types; in particular, type $E_n^{(1)}$. With the denominator formulas, we determine the simplicity of tensor product of KR modules and degrees of poles of normalized $R$-matrices between two KR modules completely in nonexceptional affine types, $D_4^{(3)}$, and $G_2^{(1)}$. As an application, we prove that the certain sets of KR modules for the untwisted affine types, suggested by Hernandez and Leclerc as clusters, form strongly commuting families, which implies that all cluster monomials in the clusters are real simple modules.</p></details>

Here we consider the case of a tilted hyperplane $H\neq \mathfrak g_1$ which is not invariant under the automorphic dilations. In the case of M\'etivier groups it is known that the $L^p$-boundedness results are stable under a small linear tilt. We show that this is generally not the case for other two-step groups, and provide new necessary conditions for $L^p$ boundedness. We prove these results in a more general setting with tilted versions of submanifolds of $\mathfrak g_1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For each positive integer $n$, we denote by $\omega^*(n)$ the number of shifted-prime divisors $p-1$ of $n$, i.e., $$\omega^*(n):=\sum_{p-1\mid n}1.$$ First introduced by Prachar in 1955, this function has interesting applications in primality testing and bears a strong connection with counting Carmichael numbers. Prachar showed that for a certain constant $c_0 > 0$, $$\omega^*(n)>\exp\left(c_0\frac{\log n}{(\log\log n)^2}\right)$$ for infinitely many $n$. This result was later improved by Adleman, Pomerance and Rumely, who established an inequality of the same shape with $(\log\log n)^2$ replaced by $\log\log n$. Assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for Dirichlet $L$-functions, Prachar also proved the stronger inequality $$\omega^*(n)>\exp\left(\left(\frac{1}{2}\log2+o(1)\right)\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\right)$$ for infinitely many $n$. By refining the arguments of Prachar and of Adleman, Pomerance and Rumely, we improve on their results by establishing \begin{align*} \omega^*(n)&>\exp\left(0.6736\log 2\cdot\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\right) \quad\text{(unconditionally)},\\ \omega^*(n)&>\exp\left(\left(\log\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)+o(1)\right)\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\right) \quad\text{(under GRH)}, \end{align*} for infinitely many $n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The representation theory of tensor functions is a powerful mathematical tool for constitutive modeling of anisotropic materials. A major limitation of the traditional theory is that many point groups require fourth- or sixth-order structural tensors, which significantly impedes practical engineering applications. Recent advances have introduced a reformulated representation theory that enables the modeling of anisotropic materials using only lower-order structural tensors (i.e., second-order or lower). Building upon the reformulated theory, this work establishes the representations of tensor functions for three-dimensional centrosymmetric point groups. For each point group, we propose a lower-order structural tensor set and derive the representations of tensor functions explicitly. For scalar-valued and second-order symmetric tensor-valued functions, our theory is indeed applicable to all three-dimensional point groups because their representations are determined by the corresponding centrosymmetric groups. The representation theory presented here is broadly applicable for constitutive modeling of anisotropic materials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The theory of locally analytic representations of $p$-adic Lie groups with $\mathbf{Q}_p$-coefficients is a powerful tool in $p$-adic Hodge theory and in the $p$-adic Langlands program. This perspective reveals important differential structures, such as the Sen and Casimir operators. Rodr\'iguez Camargo and Rodrigues Jacinto developed in \cite{RJRC22} a solid version of this theory using the language of condensed mathematics. This provides more robust homological tools (comparison theorems, spectral sequences...) for studying these representations. In this article, we extend the solid theory of locally analytic representations to a much broader class of mixed characteristic coefficients, such as $\mathbf{F}_p((X))$ or $\mathbf{Z}_p[[X]]\langle p/X\rangle[1/X]$, as well as to semilinear representations. In the introduction, we explain how these ideas could relate to mixed characteristic phenomena in $p$-adic Hodge theory, extend eigenvarieties, and the Langlands program.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A $C^1$ prime indicator $\mathcal{P}\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is constructed by applying the Fej\'er identity to the sine-quotient encoder of trial division. For integers $n\ge 2$, $\mathcal P(n)=0$ holds exactly for odd primes; $\mathcal P(2)>0$. For all non-integers $x>1$ one has $\mathcal P(x)>0$. The function is piecewise $C^\infty$ and its second derivative has jumps precisely at the squares $m^2$, with explicit sizes. Replacing the sharp cut-off by a smooth transition yields $C^\infty$ analogues $\mathcal{P}_\tau$ and $\mathcal{P}_\sigma$ with integer limits $\mathcal{P}_\tau(n;\kappa)\to \tau(n)-2$ and $\mathcal{P}_\sigma(n;\kappa)\to \sigma(n)-n-1$ as $\kappa\to\infty$, obtained from locally uniform convergence of derivative series. For large $\kappa$, numerical evidence indicates companion zeros near odd primes for $\mathcal{P}_\tau$ and an asymmetric pair for $\mathcal{P}_\sigma$. No assertion is made beyond integer input, and no statements are claimed about the prime number theorem or zero distributions of $L$-functions. The appendix includes two illustrative prime-counting sums.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Incorporating symmetries into the numerical solution of differential equations has been a mainstay of research over the last 40 years, however, one aspect is less known and under-utilised: discretisations of partial differential equations that commute with symmetry actions (like rotations, reflections or permutations) can be decoupled into independent systems solvable in parallel by incorporating knowledge from representation theory. We introduce this beautiful subject via a crash course in representation theory focussed on hands-on examples for the symmetry groups of the square and cube, and its utilisation in the construction of so-called symmetry-adapted bases. Schur's lemma, which is not well-known in applied mathematics, plays a powerful role in proving sparsity of resulting discretisations and thereby showing that partial differential equations do indeed decouple. Using Schr\"odinger equations as a motivating example, we demonstrate that a symmetry-adapted basis leads to a significant increase in the number of independent linear systems. Counterintuitively, the effectiveness of this approach is in fact greater for partial differential equations with less symmetries, for example a Schr\"odinger equation where the potential is only invariant under permutations, but not under rotations or reflections. We also explore this phenomenon as the dimension of the partial differential equation becomes large, hinting at the potential for significant savings in high-dimensions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 48 pages, 33 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Webs are a kind of planar, directed, edge-labeled graph that encode invariant vectors for quantum representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$. The theory of webs developed organically for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, where they are also known as noncrossing matchings and the Temperley-Lieb algebra, before being formalized by Kuperberg for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ as the morphisms in a diagrammatic categorification of quantum representations called the spider category. Various models extend webs to $n \geq 4$. Only Cautis-Kamnitzer-Morrison prove a full set of relations for their webs, though Fontaine's webs are better adapted to computations, more graph-theoretically natural, and directly generalize webs for $n=2$ and $n=3$. This paper formalizes the theory of Fontaine's webs, proving the existence of a deep and powerful global structure on these webs called strandings. We do three key things: 1) give a state-sum formula to construct ($U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_n)$-invariant) web vectors from the orientation of strandings on Fontaine's webs; 2) list and prove a complete set of relations, connecting strandings to the local data of binary labelings that are well-established in the literature; and 3) provide applications and examples of how strandings facilitate computations.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Expository article, 20 pages, 6 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The discrete Fourier transform has proven to be an essential tool in many geometric and combinatorial problems in vector spaces over finite fields. In general, sets with good uniform bounds for the Fourier transform appear more `random' and are easier to analyze. However, there is a trade-off: in many cases, obtaining good uniform bounds is not possible, even in situations where many points satisfy strong pointwise bounds. To address this limitation, the first named author proposed an approach where one attempts to replace the need for uniform ($L^\infty$) bounds with suitable bounds for the $L^p$ average of the Fourier transform. In subsequent joint work, the authors applied this approach successfully to improve known results in Fourier restriction and the study of orthogonal projections. In this survey we discuss this general approach, give several examples, and exhibit some of the recent applications.</p></details>

Also, for the case $q=p$, we show that $$\det B_p((p-3)/2)=0\Leftrightarrow Q_p\equiv 2\pmod{p^2\mathbb{Z}},$$ where $Q_p$ is the $p$-th term of the companion Pell sequence $\{Q_i\}_{i=0}^{\infty}$ defined by $Q_0=Q_1=2$ and $Q_{i+1}=2Q_i+Q_{i-1}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p\geq5$ be a prime number and let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field where $p$ is unramified. Under mild technical assumptions, in this paper we prove the non-existence of non-trivial finite $\Lambda$-submodules of Pontryagin duals of signed Selmer groups of a $p$-supersingular rational elliptic curve over the anticyclotomic $\mathbb Z_p$-extension of $K$, where $\Lambda$ is the corresponding Iwasawa algebra. In particular, we work under the assumption that our plus/minus Selmer groups have $\Lambda$-corank $1$, so they are not $\Lambda$-cotorsion. Our main theorem extends to the supersingular case analogous non-existence results by Bertolini in the ordinary setting; furthermore, since we cover the case where $p$ is inert in $K$, we refine previous results of Hatley-Lei-Vigni, which deal with $p$-supersingular elliptic curves under the assumption that $p$ splits in $K$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the cohomology of $C_n(X)$, the moduli space of commuting $n$-by-$n$ matrices satisfying the equations defining a variety $X$. This space can be viewed as a non-commutative Weil restriction from the algebra of $n$-by-$n$ matrices to the ground field. We introduce a ``Fermionic" counterpart $S_n(X)$, constructed as a convolution $X^n \times^{S_n} \mathrm{GL}_n/\mathrm{T}_n$. Our main result establishes that a natural map $\sigma \colon S_n(X) \to C_n(X)$ induces an isomorphism on $\ell$-adic cohomology under mild conditions on $X$ or the characteristic of the field. This confirms a heuristic derived from the classical theory of Weil restrictions and highlights a version of Boson-Fermion correspondence. Furthermore, we derive explicit combinatorial formulae for the Betti numbers of $C_n(X)$ and a Macdonald-type generating series. Finally we prove a Hermitian variant of our main result.</p></details>

As a primary application, over small finite fields we bound the $3$-torsion of Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves and the $2$-torsion of Jacobians of trigonal curves. In this setting, these bounds improve on both the trivial geometric bound and the naive inequality coming from the Weil bound, as well as recent upper bounds on $2$-torsion in the work of Bhargava et al.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We revisit the constructions given by J. Pevtsova and the author of refined invariants for finite dimensional representations of infinitesimal group schemes $\mathbb G_{(r)}$ over a field $k$ of characteristic $p>0$. Our focus is on the universal $p$-nilpotent operator seen as an element in the group algebra of the group scheme $\mathbb G_{(r),X}$ over $X$, where $X$ is either the moduli space $V_r(\mathbb G)$ of height $r$ $1$-parameter subgroups of $\mathbb G$ or the moduli space $\mathcal C_r(\mathcal N_p(\mathfrak g))$ of $r$-tuples of $p$-nilpotent, pair-wise commuting elements of the Lie algebra of $\mathbb G$. We formalize Jordan type function using several variants of the continuous function $JT_{\mathbb G,r,M}(-): \mathbb P V_r(\mathbb G) \to \mathcal Y$ where $\mathcal Y$ is the poset of Young diagrams with $p$-columns. One of these variants is designed to be more conducive to computation. The vector bundle construction given by J. Pevtsova and the author is extended to all finite dimensional $\mathbb G_{(r)}$-modules, producing coherent sheaves on $X$ which are locally free on the strata of $X$ associated to $JT_{\mathbb G,r,M}(-)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a base $b\geq 2$ and a set of digits $\mathcal{A}\subset \{0,...,b-1\}$, let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the set of prime numbers with digits restricted to $\mathcal{A}$, when written in base-$b$. We prove that if $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ has positive upper Banach density, then there exists a prime $p\in \mathcal{P}$ and two elements $a_1,a_2\in A$ such that $a_2=a_1+p-1$. The key ingredients are the Furstenberg correspondence principle and a discretized Hardy-Littlewood circle method used by Maynard. As a byproduct of our work, we prove a Dirichlet-type theorem for the distribution of $\mathcal{P}$ in residue classes, and a Vinogradov-type theorem for the decay of associated exponential sums. These estimates arise from the unique structure of associated Fourier transforms, which take the form of Riesz products.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Many interesting questions in arithmetic dynamics revolve, in one way or another, around the (local and/or global) reducibility behavior of iterates of a polynomial. We show that for very general families of integer polynomials $f$ (and, more generally, rational functions over number fields), the set of stable primes, i.e., primes modulo which all iterates of $f$ are irreducible, is a density zero set. Compared to previous results, our families cover a much wider ground, and in particular apply to $100\%$ of polynomials of any given odd degree, thus adding evidence to the conjecture that polynomials with a "large" set of stable primes are necessarily of a very specific shape, and in particular are necessarily postcritically finite.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We extend the Galois-theoretic Borovoi-Springer interpretation of algebraic bands to a class of \'etale-locally represented bands on the fppf site of an arbitrary field $k$, which we call separable bands. Next, a band represented \'etale-locally over $k$ by a pseudo-reductive group is shown to be globally representable when $[k : k^p] = p$, with counterexamples in general. When $k$ is a global or local field, we deduce a generalization of Borovoi's abelianization theory to separable bands represented by smooth connected algebraic groups. As an application, we prove that the Brauer-Manin obstruction is the only obstruction to the Hasse principle for a homogeneous space of a pseudo-reductive group (more generally, of a smooth connected affine algebraic group with split unipotent radical) having a smooth connected geometric stabilizer.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In their 1988 paper "Gluing of perverse sheaves and discrete series representations," D. Kazhdan and G. Laumon constructed an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ associated to a reductive group $G$ over a finite field with the aim of using it to construct discrete series representations of the finite Chevalley group $G(\mathbb{F}_q)$. The well-definedness of their construction depended on their conjecture that this category has finite cohomological dimension. This was disproven by R. Bezrukavnikov and A. Polishchuk in 2001, who found a counterexample in the case $G = SL_3$. In the same paper, Polishchuk then made an alternative conjecture: though this counterexample shows that the Grothendieck group $K_0(\mathcal{A})$ is not spanned by objects of finite projective dimension, he noted that a graded version of $K_0(\mathcal{A})$ can be thought of as a module over Laurent polynomials and conjectured that a certain localization of this module is generated by objects of finite projective dimension, and suggested that this conjecture could lead toward a proof that Kazhdan and Laumon's construction is well-defined. He proved this conjecture in Types $A_1, A_2, A_3$, and $B_2$. In the present paper, we prove Polishchuk's conjecture in full generality, and go on to prove that Kazhdan and Laumon's construction is indeed well-defined, giving a new geometric construction of discrete series representations of $G(\mathbb{F}_q)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The article presents results on the well-known problem concerning the structure of integer polynomials $p_n(z; x, y)$, which define multiplication laws in $n$-valued groups $\mathbb{G}_n$ over the field of complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$. We show that the $n$-valued multiplication in the group $\mathbb{G}_n$ is realized in terms of the eigenvalues of the Kronecker sum of companion Frobenius matrices for polynomials of the form $t^n - x$ in the variable $t$. The notion of a Wendt $(x, y, z)$-matrix is introduced. When $x = (-1)^n$, $y = z = 1$, one recovers the classical Wendt matrix, whose determinant is used in number theory in connection with Fermat's Last Theorem. It is shown that for each positive integer $n$, the polynomial $p_n$ is given by the determinant of a Wendt $(x, y, z)$-matrix. Iterations of the $n$-valued multiplication in the group $\mathbb{G}_n$ lead to polynomials $p_n(z; x_1, \dots, x_m)$. We prove the irreducibility of the polynomial $p_n(z; x_1, \dots, x_m)$ over various fields. For each $n$, we introduce the notion of classes of symmetric $n$-algebraic $n$-valued groups. The group $\mathbb{G}_n$ belongs to one of these classes. For $n = 2, 3$, a description of the universal objects of these classes is obtained.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The main result of this paper is that there is an additive equivalence between $\overline{\mathcal{C}}_n$, the Paquette-Yildirim completion of the discrete cluster categories of Dynkin type $A_{\infty}$, and the perfect derived category of a certain DG algebra. This additive equivalence preserves some of the triangulated structure: it commutes with the suspension functor and preserves triangles with at least two indecomposable terms. In the process, we introduce the notion of a linear generator $G$ in a Krull-Schmidt, Hom-finite triangulated category. It turns out that the existence of a linear generator affords a large amount of control over $\mathcal{T}$. For example, it allows us to describe all indecomposable objects in $\mathcal{T}$ in terms of $G$, to determine all triangles of $\mathcal{T}$ with at least two indecomposable objects, and to show that the Rouquier dimension of $\mathcal{T}$ is at most one. Moreover, we prove that there is an additive equivalence (which preserves some of the triangulated structure) between $\mathcal{T}$ and the perfect derived category of a certain DG algebra. Finally, we show that any triangulated category with a linear generator is additively equivalent to a thick subcategory of $\overline{\mathcal{C}}_n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the rationality of the characteristic form for a degree one character of the Galois group of an abelian extension of henselian discrete valuation fields. We prove the integrality of the characteristic form for a rank one sheaf on a regular excellent scheme. These properties are shown by reducing to the corresponding properties of the refined Swan conductor proved by Kato. We define the F-characteristic cycle of a rank one sheaf on an arithmetic surface as a cycle on the FW-cotangent bundle using the characteristic form on the basis of the computation of the characteristic cycle in the equal characteristic case by Yatagawa. The rationality and the integrality of the characteristic form are necessary for the definition of the F-characteristic cycle. We prove the intersection of the F-characteristic cycle with the 0-section computes the Swan conductor of cohomology of the generic fiber.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we give the upper bounds on the variance for cubic moment of Hecke--Maass cusp forms and Eisenstein series respectively. For the cusp form case, the bound comes from a large sieve inequality for symmetric cubes. We also give some nontrivial bounds for higher moments of symmetric cube $L$-functions. For the Eisenstein series case, the upper bound comes from Lindel\"of-on-average type bounds for various $L$-functions. In particular, we establish the sharp upper bounds for the fourth moment of $\mathrm{GL}(2)\times \mathrm{GL}(2)$ $L$-functions and the eighth moment of $\mathrm{GL}(2)$ $L$-functions around special points $1/2+it_j$. Our proof is based on the work of Chandee and Li \cite{C-L20} about bounding the second moment of $\mathrm{GL}(4)\times \mathrm{GL}(2)$ $L$-functions.</p></details>
