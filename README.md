<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We address two questions related to the semiampleness of line bundles arising from Hodge theory. First, we prove there is a functorial compactification of the image of a period map of a polarizable integral pure variation of Hodge structures for which the Griffiths bundle extends amply. In particular the Griffiths bundle is semiample. We prove more generally that the Hodge bundle of a Calabi--Yau variation of Hodge structures is semiample subject to some extra conditions, and as our second result deduce the b-semiampleness conjecture of Prokhorov--Shokurov. The semiampleness results (and the construction of the Baily--Borel compactifications) crucially use o-minimal GAGA, and the deduction of the b-semiampleness conjecture uses work of Ambro and results of Koll\'ar on the geometry of minimal lc centers to verify the extra conditions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jaro Eichler &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Naidu classified pairs of finite groups and 3-cocycles that lead to equivalent Dijkgraaf-Witten theories for 3-manifolds. We establish analogous equivalences for arithmetic Dijkgraaf-Witten theory over totally imaginary number fields F containing n-th roots of unity, where n is invertible on X subset spec O_F. For the full ring of integers X = spec O_F, we give examples with quadratic fields and the quaternion group Q_8 where these equivalences fail, but also identify sufficient conditions under which they still hold.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work we achieve a full understanding of the so-called entanglement of radicals, showing that over any field there are extremely few additive relations among radicals. Our results complete a famous theorem by Kneser from 1975 on the linear independence of radicals and solve a problem discussed by Lenstra in 2006.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the extension of Presburger arithmetic by the class of sub-polynomial Hardy field functions, and show the majority of these extensions to be undecidable. More precisely, we show that the theory $\mathrm{Th}(\mathbb{Z}; <, +, \lfloor f \rceil)$, where $f$ is a Hardy field function and $\lfloor \cdot \rceil$ the nearest integer operator, is undecidable when $f$ grows polynomially faster than $x$. Further, we show that when $f$ grows sub-linearly quickly, but still as fast as some polynomial, the theory $\mathrm{Th}(\mathbb{Z}; <, +, \lfloor f \rceil)$ is undecidable.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 37 pages; updated to reference Littlewood's problem

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We examine sets $\mathscr A$ of natural numbers having the property that for some real number $p\in (0,2)$, one has the subconvex bound $$\int_0^1 \Bigl| \sum_{n\in \mathscr A\cap [1,N]}e(n\alpha)\Bigr|^p\, {\rm d}\alpha \ll N^{-1}|\mathscr A\cap [1,N]|^p.$$ We show that exponential sums over such sets satisfy inequalities analogous to Weyl's inequality, and in many circumstances of the same strength as classical versions of Weyl's bound. We also examine equidistribution of polynomials modulo $1$ in which the summands are restricted to these subconvex $L^p$-sets. In addition, we describe applications to problems involving character sums and averages of arithmetic functions.</p></details>

In this paper we study the limiting distributions of the normalized $L$-polynomials of the curves by computing their Sato-Tate groups and distributions. We also provide results for the number of points on the curves over finite fields, including a formula in terms of Jacobi sums when the field $\mathbb F_q$ satisfies $q\equiv 1 \pmod{\ell^2}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give an introduction to our results on cluster structures for schemes of $(G,c)$-bands emphasizing their connections with seminal works of Frenkel and Reshetikhin in the 90's. In particular we construct using $(G,c)$-bands a discrete analogue of the difference Miura transformation of the loop group $LG$, and we show that it calculates the $q$-characters of the finite-dimensional representations of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ of the same $A$, $D$, $E$ type as $G$, thus verifying a conjecture of Frenkel and Reshetikhin.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the nearby cycles functor for the $p$-adic Hecke stack at parahoric level is perverse t-exact, by developing a theory of Wakimoto filtrations at Iwahori level, and that it lifts to the $\mathbb{E}_1$-center. We apply these tools to construct the Arkhipov-Bezrukavnikov functor for $p$-adic affine flag varieties at Iwahori level, and prove that it is an equivalence for all classical groups and also exceptional groups of type $E_6$ and $E_7$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article investigates Dehornoy's monomial representations for structure groups and Coxeter-like groups of a set-theoretic solution to the Yang-Baxter equation. Using the brace structure of these two groups and the language of cycle sets, we relate the irreducibility of monomial representations to the indecomposability of the solutions. Furthermore, in the case of an indecomposable solution, we show how to obtain these representations by induction from explicit one-dimensional representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of intersective polynomials over the Gaussian integers, and prove that given any intersective polynomial $p(x)$ over the Gaussian integers, every subset $A$ of the Gaussian integers of positive upper density contains two distinct elements such that their difference is $p(z)$ for some Gaussian integer $z$. Moreover, we also obtain a quantitative version of this result. The proof is motivated by an argument due to Lucier, and the Fourier-free proof of the Furstenberg--S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy theorem over the integers by Green, Tao and Ziegler.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Word maps have been studied for matrix groups over a field. We initiate the study of problems related to word maps in the context of the group $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathscr O_2)$, where $\mathscr O_2$ is a finite local principal ideal ring of length two (e.g. $\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb F_q[t]/\langle t^2\rangle$). We study the power map $g\mapsto g^L$, where $L$ is a positive integer. We consider $L$ to be coprime to $p$ (an odd prime), the characteristic of the residue field $k$ of $\mathscr O_2$. We classify all the elements in the image, whose mod-$\mathfrak m$ reduction in $\mathrm{GL}_n(k)$ are either regular semisimple or cyclic, where $\mathfrak m$ is the unique maximal ideal of $\mathscr O_2$. Our main tool is a Hensel lifting for polynomial equations over $\mathrm{M}_n(\mathscr O_2)$, which we establish in this work. A central contribution of this work is the construction of canonical forms for certain natural classes of matrices over $\mathscr O_2$. As applications, we derive explicit generating functions for the probabilities that a random element of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathscr O_2)$ is regular semisimple, $L$-power regular semisimple, compatible cyclic, or $L$-power compatible cyclic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A monic polynomial $f(x)\in {\mathbb Z}[x]$ of degree $n$ is called monogenic if $f(x)$ is irreducible over ${\mathbb Q}$ and $\{1,\theta,\theta^2,\ldots ,\theta^{n-1}\}$ is a basis for the ring of integers of ${\mathbb Q}(\theta)$, where $f(\theta)=0$. A strictly-Perron polynomial is the minimal polynomial of a Perron number $\lambda$ such that $\lambda$ is neither a Pisot number, an anti-Pisot number, nor a Salem number. For any natural number $n\ge 2$, we prove that there exist infinitely many monogenic strictly-Perron polynomials of degree $n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a conservative ergodic measure-preserving transformation $T$ of the measure space $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$ with $\mu$ a $\sigma$-finite measure and $\mu(X)=\infty$. Given an observable $g:X\to \mathbb{R}$, it is well known from results by Aaronson that in general the asymptotic behaviour of the Birkhoff sums $S_Ng(x):= \sum_{j=1}^N\, (g\circ T^{j-1})(x)$ strongly depends on the point $x\in X$, and that there exists no sequence $(d_N)$ for which $S_Ng(x)/d_N \to 1$ for $\mu$-almost every $x\in X$. In this paper we consider the case $g\not\in L^1(X,\mu)$ assuming that there exists $E\in\mathcal{B}$ with $\mu(E)<\infty$ and $\int_E g\,\mathrm{d}\mu=\infty$ and continue the investigation initiated in previous work by the authors. We show that for transformations $T$ with strong mixing assumptions for the induced map on a finite measure set, the almost sure asymptotic behaviour of $S_Ng(x)$ for an unbounded observable $g$ may be obtained using two methods, adding a number of summands depending on $x$ to $S_Ng$ and trimming. The obtained sums are then asymptotic to a scalar multiple of $N$. The results are applied to a couple of non-regular continued fraction algorithms, the backward (or R\'enyi type) continued fraction and the even-integer continued fraction algorithms, to obtain the almost sure asymptotic behaviour of the sums of the digits of the algorithms.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Robert McRae, Valerii Sopin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 35 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For coprime $p,q\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$, the triplet vertex operator algebra $W_{p,q}$ is a non-simple extension of the universal Virasoro vertex operator algebra of central charge $c_{p,q}=1-\frac{6(p-q)^2}{pq}$, and it is a basic example of a vertex operator algebra appearing in logarithmic conformal field theory. Here, we give a new construction of $W_{p,q}$ different from the original screening operator definition of Feigin-Gainutdinov-Semikhatov-Tipunin. Using our earlier work on the tensor category structure of modules for the Virasoro algebra at central charge $c_{p,q}$, we show that the simple modules appearing in the decomposition of $W_{p,q}$ as a module for the Virasoro algebra have $PSL_2$-fusion rules and generate a symmetric tensor category equivalent to $\mathrm{Rep}\,PSL_2$. Then we use the theory of commutative algebras in braided tensor categories to construct $W_{p,q}$ as an appropriate non-simple modification of the canonical algebra in the Deligne tensor product of $\mathrm{Rep}\,PSL_2$ with this Virasoro subcategory. As a consequence, we show that the automorphism group of $W_{p,q}$ is $PSL_2(\mathbb{C})$. We also define a braided tensor category $\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ consisting of modules for the Virasoro algebra at central charge $c_{p,q}$ that induce to untwisted modules of $W_{p,q}$. We show that $\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ tensor embeds into the $PSL_2(\mathbb{C})$-equivariantization of the category of $W_{p,q}$-modules and is closed under contragredient modules. We conjecture that $\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ has enough projective objects and is the correct category of Virasoro modules for constructing logarithmic minimal models in conformal field theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Latex file, 59 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a criterion for a vertex operator superalgebra homomorphism from an affine vertex algebra to another vertex superalgebra to be conformal, and an additional criterion that guarantees that this homomorphism is surjective. This situation is applied to W-algebras and W-superalgebras and we list all cases where our criterion applies. This gives many new examples of W-algebras that collapse to affine vertex algebras or are conformal extensions. In particular, we provide many examples of simple W-algebras at non-admissible levels that collapse to admissible level affine vertex algebras.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Based on the first author's University of Warwick PhD thesis. Revised version, 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a $p$-adic Rankin-Selberg $L$-function associated to the product of two families of modular forms, where the first is an ordinary (Hida) family, and the second an arbitrary universal-deformation family (without any ordinarity condition at $p$). This gives a function on a 4-dimensional base space - strictly larger than the ordinary eigenvariety, which is 3-dimensional in this case. We prove our $p$-adic $L$-function interpolates all critical values of the Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions for the classical specialisations of our family, and derive a functional equation for our $p$-adic $L$-function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>95 years ago Hoheisel proved the existence of primes in the sub-linear interval $$ \left[x, x+x^{1-{1\over 33000}}\right] \qquad \hbox{for $x$ sufficiently large}. $$ This was improved by Heilbronn, proving existence of primes in the interval $$ \left[x, x+x^{1-{1\over 250}}\right] \qquad \hbox{for $x$ sufficiently large}. $$ More recently Baker, Harman, Pintz proved existence of primes in the interval $$ \left[x, x+ x^{1-{19\over 40}}\right] \qquad \hbox{for $x$ sufficiently large}. $$ In the present article I will, to the extent possible, make some of these statements effective. Specifically, among other things, I shall show that $$ \forall n \geq 4, \qquad\forall x \geq \exp(\exp(33)), \qquad \hbox{there are primes in the interval} \left[x, x+ x^{1-{1\over n}}\right]; $$ $$ \forall n \geq 156, \qquad\forall x \geq [155^{155}]^{n/(n-155)} , \qquad \hbox{there are primes in the interval} \left[x, x+ x^{1-{1\over n}}\right]. $$ Furthermore $$ \forall n \geq 185, \qquad\forall x \geq 1, \qquad \hbox{there are primes in the interval} \left[x, x+ x^{1-{1\over n}}\right]. $$ In particular this last observation makes both the Hoheisel and Heilbronn results fully explicit and effective. This (relatively) specific observation can be extended and generalized in various manners.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 50 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The $g$-fan $\Sigma(A)$ of a finite dimensional algebra $A$ is a non-singular fan in its real Grothendieck group, defined by tilting theory. If the union ${\rm P}(A)$ of the simplices associated with the cones of $\Sigma(A)$ is convex, we call $A$ $g$-convex. In this case, the $g$-polytope ${\rm P}(A)$ of $A$ is a reflexive polytope. Thus, in each dimension, there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of fans that can be realized as $g$-fans of $g$-convex algebras. An important problem is to classify such fans for a fixed dimension $d$. In this paper, we give a complete answer for the case $d=3$: we prove that there are precisely 61 convex $g$-fans of dimension 3 up to isomorphism. Our method is based on the decomposition of fans into the $2^3$ orthants in the real Grothendieck group of $A$, together with a detailed analysis of possible sequences of $g$-vectors arising from iterated mutations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study cancellation in sums of Hecke eigenvalues over irreducible quadratic polynomials over short intervals. In particular, we look at an average over bases of Hecke forms of weight $k$ in the range $\vert k-K\vert<K^\theta$ where $1/3<\theta<1$. We see that when averaged over this family such sums admit square root cancellation. The key new arithmetic input for such a result is a bound on sums of Kloosterman sums over irreducible quadratic polynomials. Then using work of Nelson, we relate such sums to the mass equidistribution conjecture for modular forms on compact arithmetic surfaces, and we show that almost all forms satisfy the mass equidistribution conjecture. Furthermore, such forms will satisfy the conjecture with an effective convergence rate of $k^{-\delta}$ for any $\delta<1/2$.</p></details>

The proof combines several ingredients, including a lower bound estimate on the measure of sums of linear transformations of compact sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$, a variant of Freiman's theorem tuned specifically to sums of dilates and the analysis of what we call lattice density, which succinctly captures how a subset of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is arranged relative to a given flag of lattices.

We quantify the accuracy of asymptotic approximations for $F_k(n)$ for $n\gg1$. Our results subsume and extend some results published by previous authors. We also present a basis (or `fundamental solutions') to solve the above recurrence for arbitrary initial conditions. We comment on the use of generating functions and multinomial sums for the $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers and related sequences.

Fix a one--parameter subgroup $\exp(\mathbb R X)$ and a noncentral element $Y$ (not assumed to commute with $X$). For every nonzero smooth vector $f$, any finite collection $\{\pi(\exp(x_k X))f\}_{k=1}^m$ of translates along $\exp(\mathbb R X)$, together with the single translate $\pi(\exp Y)f$, is linearly independent. The proof combines Schwartz regularity of matrix coefficients in the noncentral variables with an ergodic log--product estimate on a compact torus generated by commutator phases. Specializing to the Schr\"odinger representation of the Heisenberg group $\mathbb H_d$, we obtain an HRT--type statement for $(m,1)$ configurations (on--line direction with zero $X_{k_0}$--component and rogue $\exp X_{k_0}$) for all nonzero Schwartz windows, without spacing</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It has been well known since Gauss that the principality of an ideal in a real quadratic field $K$ is equivalent to the solvability of a certain generalized Pell equations. In this paper, we combine this classical result with Srinivasan's conditions for the existence of well-rounded ideals in $K$ to obtain necessary and sufficient criteria for a real quadratic field to have principal well-rounded (PWR) ideals. Using these criteria, we prove that there are infinitely many real quadratic fields that have PWR ideals. Moreover, these ideals are pairwise non-similar. We then construct new algorithms that produce these PWR ideals, especially when the field discriminant is large. Our algorithms run in sub-exponential time theoretically; however, they are very fast in practice by employing some commonly used probabilistic algorithms for testing squarefreeness. Finally, we briefly consider criteria for the existence of prime PWR ideals and show that there are infinitely many real quadratic fields that have prime PWR ideals.</p></details>

In this paper, we give a complete classification of integers $N>1$ with $c(N)=0$, and we also show that $c(N)$ goes to infinity if both the number of distinct prime factors of $N$ and the smallest prime factor of $N$ go to infinity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A sequence $s_1,s_2,\ldots, s_k$ of elements of a group $G$ is called a valid ordering if the partial products $s_1, s_1 s_2, \ldots, s_1\cdots s_k$ are all distinct. A long-standing problem in combinatorial group theory asks whether, for a given group $G$, every subset $S \subseteq G\setminus \{\mathrm{id}\}$ admits a valid ordering; the instance of the additive group $\mathbb{F}_p$ is the content of a well-known 1971 conjecture of Graham. Most partial progress to date has concerned the edge cases where either $S$ or $G \setminus S$ is quite small. Our main result is an essentially complete resolution of the problem for $G=\mathbb{F}_2^n$: we show that there is an absolute constant $C>0$ such that every subset $S\subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n \setminus \{0\}$ of size at least $C$ admits a valid ordering. Our proof combines techniques from additive and probabilistic combinatorics, including the Freiman--Ruzsa theorem and the absorption method. Along the way, we also solve the general problem for moderately large subsets: there is a constant $c>0$ such that for every group $G$ (not necessarily abelian), every subset $S \subseteq G\setminus \{\mathrm{id}\}$ of size at least $|G|^{1-c}$ admits a valid ordering. Previous work in this direction concerned only sets of size at least $(1-o(1))|G|$. A main ingredient in our proof is a structural result, similar in spirit to the Arithmetic Regularity Lemma, showing that every Cayley graph can be efficiently decomposed into mildly quasirandom components.</p></details>

We introduce two new panorbital residues and show that they, together with the orbital residues introduced in 2018 by Dreyfus, Hardouin, Roques, and Singer, comprise a complete obstruction to the elliptic summability problem. The underlying elliptic curve can be described in any of the usual ways: as a complex torus, as a Tate curve, or as a one-dimensional abelian variety. We develop the necessary results from scratch intrinsically within each setting; in the last two of them, we also work in arbitrary characteristic. We include several basic concrete examples of computation of orbital and panorbital residues for some summable and non-summable functions in each setting. We conclude by applying the technology of orbital and panorbital residues to obtain several new results of independent interest.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $R_{\alpha}$ being an irrational rotation of angle $\alpha$ on the one torus $\mathbb{T}$ and $\phi(x)=\frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{1-x}$, we compare the behavior of the Birkhoff sum $S_N(\phi)=\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}(\phi\circ R_{\alpha}^k)(x)$ with the successive entry $(\phi\circ R_{\alpha}^N)(x)$. In particular, we are interested in the almost sure limsup behavior of $\frac{(\phi\circ R_{\alpha}^N)(x)}{S_N(\phi)(x)}$. We show that depending on the Diophantine properties of $\alpha$ we have that the limsup either equals $0$ or $\infty$. Moreover, we show that those $\alpha$ for which the limsup equals $0$ form an atypical set in the sense that its Hausdorff dimension equals $\frac{1}{2}$. These results have consequences in studying a reparametrization $(T_t)$ of the linear flow $(L_t)$ with direction $(1,\alpha)$ on the two torus $\mathbb{T}^2$ with function $\varphi$, where $\varphi$ is a smooth non-negative function that has exactly two (non-degenerate) zeros at $\bf p$ and $\bf q$.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Vladimir Gurvich, Mariya Naumova &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A number $N$ is a triangular number if it can be written as $N = t(t + 1)/2$ for some nonnegative integer number $t$. A triangular number $N$ is called square if it is a perfect square, that is, $N = d^2$ for some integer number $d$. Square triangular numbers were characterized by Euler in 1778 and are in one-to-one correspondence with the so-called near-isosceles Pythagorean triples $(k,k+1,l)$, where $k^2 + (k+1)^2 = l^2$. A quadratic number is the product $\Pi = \Pi(k,j) = k(k+1)(k+j)(k+j+1)$ for some nonnegative integer numbers $k$ and $j$. By definition, it is the product of two triangular numbers and 4. Quadratic number $\Pi$ and the corresponding pair $(k,j)$ are called square if $\Pi$ is a perfect square. Clearly, $(k,j)$ is square if both triangular numbers $k(k+1)/2$ and $(k+j)(k+j+1)/2$ are perfect squares. Yet, there exist infinitely many other square quadratic numbers. We construct polynomials $j_i(k)$ of degree $i$ with positive integer coefficients satisfying equations: $k + j_{2 \ell}(k) + 1 = k [a_\ell k^\ell + \dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 +1 = (k+1) [b_\ell k^\ell + \dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ and \newline $k + j_{2\ell+1}(k) + 1 = k(k+1) [a_\ell k^\ell + \dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 + 1 = [b_{\ell+1} k^{\ell+1}+b_\ell k^\ell + \dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ for some positive integer $\ell$ and some coefficients $a_i, b_j$, $i=0, \ldots, \ell, j=0, \ldots, \ell+1$. All the obtained pairs $(k, j_i(k))$ are square. We conjecture that the products of square triangular numbers and pairs $(k, j_i(k))$ cover all quadratic squares. Additionally, we identify pairs of intervals of successive integers with equal sums of squares.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an irreducible smooth representation of a connected reductive $p$-adic group, two important associated invariants are the wavefront set and the (partly conjectural) Langlands parameter. While a wavefront set consists of $p$-adic nilpotent orbits, one constituent of the Langlands parameter is a complex nilpotent orbit in the dual Lie algebra. For unipotent representations in the sense of Lusztig, the corresponding nilpotent orbits on the two sides are related via the Lusztig--Spaltenstein duality, by the work of Ciubotaru--Mason-Brown--Okada. In this paper, we formulate a general upper-bound conjecture and several variants relating the nilpotent orbits that appear in the wavefront set and in the Langlands parameter. We also verify these expectations in some cases, including the depth-zero supercuspidal representations of classical groups and all the irreducible representations of $G_2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Waring's Problem asks whether, for each positive integer $k$, there exists an integer $s$ such that every positive integer is a sum of at most $k$th powers. While Hilbert proved the existence of such $s$, Waring's Problem has lead to areas of related work, namely the function $g(k)$, which denotes the least such $s$. There is no known general closed form for $g(k)$, though for $g(k)$ has been evaluated for small $k$. Prior work has reduced the problem to verifying a particular condition, which if never occurs, implies an expression for $g(k)$. In this paper, I present a proof the condition never occurs, thus fixing the value of $g(k)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper provides a systematization of some recent results in homology of algebras. Our main theorem gives criteria under which the homology of a diagram algebra is isomorphic to the homology of the subalgebra on diagrams having the maximum number of left-to-right connections. From this theorem, we deduce the `invertible-parameter' cases of the Temperley-Lieb and Brauer results of Boyd-Hepworth and Boyd-Hepworth-Patzt. We are also able to give a new proof of Sroka's theorem that the homology of an odd-strand Temperley-Lieb algebra vanishes, as well as an analogous result for Brauer algebras and an interpretation of both results in the even-strand case. Our proofs are relatively elementary: in particular, no auxiliary chain complexes or spectral sequences are required. We briefly discuss the relationship to cellular algebras in the sense of Graham-Lehrer.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the existence of a new structure on the first Galois cohomology of generic families of symplectic self-dual $p$-adic representations of $G_{\mathbb{Q}_p}$ of rank two (a local sign decomposition): a functorial decomposition into free rank one Lagrangian submodules which encodes the $p$-adic variation of Bloch--Kato subgroups via completed epsilon constants, mirroring a symplectic structure. The local sign decomposition has diverse local as well as global arithmetic consequences. This includes compatibility of the Mazur--Rubin arithmetic local constant and completed epsilon constants, answering a question of Mazur and Rubin. The compatibility leads to new cases of the $p$-parity conjecture for Hilbert modular forms at supercuspidal primes $p$. We also formulate and prove an analogue of Rubin's conjecture over ramified quadratic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Using it, we construct an integral $p$-adic $L$-function for anticyclotomic deformation of a CM elliptic curve at primes $p$ ramified in the CM field.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It has been known for a long time that Ext's between IC-sheaves may often be expressed in terms of Hom's between cohomology groups. We prove a more general result under weaker assumptions. The result is used to describe the action of the derived Satake equivalence on !-pure objects and show that the equivalence enjoys a new kind of functoriality with respect to morphisms of reductive groups. We find and prove normality of the symplectic dual X^! for many smooth affine Hamiltonian G-varieties X, including X=T^*(G/H) for all connected reductive subgroups H of G. We also describe the symplectic duals M^! in the case of Coulomb branches and prove that M^! has symplectic singularities.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study purely exponential Diophantine equations with four terms of consecutive bases. Notably, we prove that all solutions to the equation $$ n^x=(n+1)^y+(n+2)^z+(n+3)^w $$ in positive integers $n,x,y,z$ and $w$ are given by $(n,x,y,z,w)=(2,5,1,1,2)$, $(3,3,2,1,1)$. Our proof of this result for each $n \ge 4$ provides an explicit modulus $M$ such that the corresponding equation has no solution already modulo $M$. This contributes to a classical problem posed by T. Skolem in 1930's on a local-global principle on purely exponential Diophantine equations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Here, we establish a polynomial identity in three variables $a, b, c$, and with the degree of the polynomial given in terms of two integers $L, M$. By letting $L$ and $M$ tend to infinity, we get the 1993 Alladi-Gordon $q$-hypergeometric key-identity for the generalized Schur Theorem as well as the fundamental Lebesgue identity by two different choices of the variables. This polynomial identity provides a generalization and a unified approach to the Schur and Lebesgue theorems. We discuss other analytic identities for the Lebesgue and Schur theorems and also provide a key identity ($q$-hypergeometric) for Andrews' deep refinement of the Alladi-Schur theorem. Finally, we discuss a new infinite hierarchy of identities, the first three of which relate to the partition theorems of Euler, Lebesgue, and Capparelli, and provide their polynomial versions as well.</p></details>

It has been suggested that one could prove the undecidability of $\mathrm{Th}(\mathbb{C}(t))$ by showing that the theory of the structure $\mathsf{CM} := (\mathbb{C},+,\cdot,0,1,CM)$ of the field of complex numbers considered with a unary predicate picking out CM is undecidable. We show using an effective version of the Andr\'e-Oort conjecture that to the contrary $\mathrm{Th}(\mathsf{CM})$ is stable and decidable. We discuss some related structures on the complex numbers definable in $\mathbb{C}(t)$ and how their theories may be connected to the Zilber-Pink conjectures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The modular curves in the family $X_1(N)$ for natural numbers $N$ parametrize elliptic curves over the complex numbers with a distinguished point of order $N$. The purpose of this paper is to better understand how to calculate the degrees of points on $X_1(\ell^n)$ for a prime $\ell$ and arbitrary positive integer $n$. In analogy with the definition of the level of a Galois representation, we construct a new definition: the level of a fiber of a closed point on a modular curve. Using this definition, we prove that, under certain conditions, if the degree of a point on $X_1(\ell^{k+1})$ is as large as possible given the degree of its image on $X_1(\ell^k),$ then its lifts on $X_1(\ell^n)$ have degree as large as possible for all $n > k$. We prove this result using techniques inspired by work of Lang and Trotter which gives a similar result for the image of $\ell$-adic Galois representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G=G_{n}=GL(n)$ be the $n\times n$ complex general linear group and embed $G_{n-1}=GL(n-1)$ in the top left hand corner of $G$. The standard Borel subgroup of upper triangular matrices $B_{n-1}$ of $G_{n-1}$ acts on the flag variety of $G$ with finitely many orbits. In this paper, we show that each $B_{n-1}$-orbit is the intersection of orbits of two Borel subgroups of $G$ acting on the flag variety of $G$. This allows us to give a new combinatorial description of the $B_{n-1}$-orbits by associating to each orbit a pair of Weyl group elements. The closure relations for the $B_{n-1}$-orbits can then be understood in terms of the Bruhat order on the Weyl group, and the Richardson-Springer monoid action on the orbits can be understood in terms of the classical monoid action of the Weyl group on itself. This approach makes the closure relation more transparent than in earlier work of Magyar and the monoid action significantly more computable than in our earlier papers, and also allows us to obtain new information about the orbits including a simple formula for the dimension of an orbit.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\pi$ and $\pi'$ be unitary cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}(n)$ and $\mathrm{GL}(n')$ over a number field $F$. We establish a new zero-free region for all $\mathrm{GL}(1)$-twists of the Rankin-Selberg $L$-function $L(s,\pi\times\pi')$, generalizing Tatuzawa's refinement of Siegel's work on Dirichlet $L$-functions. As a corollary, we show that for all $\varepsilon>0$, there exists an effectively computable constant $c>0$ depending only on $(n,n',[F:\mathbb{Q}],\varepsilon)$ such that $L(s,\pi\times\pi')$ has at most one zero (necessarily simple) in the region $$ \mathrm{Re}(s)\geq 1-c/(C(\pi)C(\pi')(|\mathrm{Im}(s)|+1))^{\varepsilon}, $$ where $C(\pi)$ and $C(\pi')$ are the analytic conductors. A crucial component of our proof is a new standard zero-free region for any twist of $L(s,\pi\times\widetilde{\pi})$ by an idele class character $\chi$ apart from a possible single exceptional zero (necessarily real and simple) that can occur only when $\pi\otimes\chi^2=\pi$. This extends earlier work of Humphries and Thorner.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Mossinghoff, Trudgian, and the first author~\cite{MMT23} recently introduced a family of arithmetic functions called ``fake $\mu$'s'', which are multiplicative functions for which there is a $\{-1,0,1\}$-valued sequence $(\varepsilon_j)_{j=1}^{\infty}$ such that $f(p^j) = \varepsilon_j$ for all primes $p$. They investigated comparative number-theoretic results for fake $\mu$'s and in particular proved oscillation results at scale $\sqrt{x}$ for the summatory functions of fake $\mu$'s with $\varepsilon_1=-1$ and $\varepsilon_2=1$. In this paper, we establish new oscillation results for the summatory functions of all nontrivial fake $\mu$'s at scales $x^{1/2\ell}$ where $\ell$ is a positive integer (the ``critical index'') depending on $f$; for $\ell=1$ this recovers the oscillation results in~\cite{MMT23}. Our work also recovers results on the indicator functions of powerfree and powerfull numbers; we generalize techniques applied to each of these examples to extend to all fake $\mu$'s.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent article, Donoso, Le, Moreira and Sun studied sets of recurrence for actions of the multiplicative semigroup $(\mathbb{N}, \times)$ and provided some sufficient conditions for sets of the form $S=\{(an+b)/(cn+d) \colon n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ to be sets of recurrence for such actions. A necessary condition for $S$ to be a set of multiplicative recurrence is that for every completely multiplicative function $f$ taking values on the unit circle, we have that $\liminf_{n \to \infty} |f(an+b)-f(cn+d)|=0.$ In this article, we fully characterize the integer quadruples $(a,b,c,d)$ which satisfy the latter property. Our result generalizes a result of Klurman and Mangerel concerning the pair $(n,n+1)$, as well as some results of Donoso, Le, Moreira and Sun. In addition, we prove that, under the same conditions on $(a,b,c,d)$, the set $S$ is a set of recurrence for finitely generated actions of $(\mathbb{N}, \times)$.</p></details>

Elkies and Speyer, answering a question by Dimitrov, showed there is a critical exponential growth threshold, such that there are infinitely many IVPs with growth above the threshold and finitely many IVPs below that threshold (of arbitrary degree). In this paper, we give more refined estimates for the number of IVPs having exponential growth thresholds. In addition, we consider a similar problem, where there is a (not necessarily symmetric) growth condition on the integers. Notably, the critical threshold is determined by the logarithmic capacity of an explicit domain.</p></details>

In particular, let $f$ be a nonnegative multiplicative function. We prove that if there exists a $\beta<1$ such that $f(p^l)\ll (\log\log x)^{l\beta}$ for every prime $p$ and every $l>1$, and if $f(n)\ll \max\{n^\epsilon,(\log x)^\epsilon\}$ for every $\epsilon>0$, then $$\sum_{\substack{x\leq n\leq x+y \\ n\equiv a\pmod k}}f(n)\ll \frac{x}{\phi(k)(\log x)^{1-\epsilon_0}}\exp\left(\sum_{\substack{p\leq x \\ p\nmid k}}\frac{f(p)}{p}\right)$$ for every $\epsilon_0>0$, where $x$, $y$, and $k$ are as they were in Shiu's original paper and $(a,k)=1$. Moreover, we prove that if $f$ is a $Q$-smooth-supported function then there exists a constant $C$ for which $$\sum_{\substack{x\leq n\leq x+y \\ n\equiv a\pmod k}}f(n)\ll \frac{x}{\phi(k)(\log x)^{1-\epsilon_0}}\exp\left(\sum_{\substack{p\leq x \\ p\nmid k}}\frac{f(p)}{p}\right)\rho(u)^C,$$ where $u=\frac{\log x}{\log Q}$, $\rho$ is the Dickman-de Bruijn function, and $C$ depends on whether we choose the bound of $f(p^l)\leq A_1^l$ or $f(p^l)\ll (\log\log x)^{l\beta}$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime and let $S_2(\Gamma(p))$ be the space of weight $2$ cusp forms for the principal congruence subgroup $\Gamma(p)$. Then $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ acts on $S_2(\Gamma(p))$ in a natural way. Around 1928, Hecke proved that if $p>3$ and $p\equiv 3\mod 4$, then the class number of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-p})$ is equal to the difference between the multiplicities of two particular irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ in $S_2(\Gamma(p))$. In this paper we prove a Lie algebra analogue of this result. As an application we extend Hecke's result to $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/p^r)$ (acting on $S_2(\Gamma(p^r))$) for any $r\geq 2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let Y be a random variable whose moment generating function exists in a neighborhood of the origin. The aim of this paper is to represent arbitrary polynomials in terms of probabilistic Frobenius-Euler polynomials associated with Y and probabilistic degenerate Frobenius-Euler polynomials associated with Y , and more generally of their higher-order counterparts. We derive explicit formulas with the help of umbral calculus and illustrate our results in the case of several random variables Y</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define and study an analogue of Category O in the context of Kazhdan and Laumon's gluing construction for perverse sheaves on the basic affine space. We explicitly describe the simple objects in this category, and we show its linearized Grothendieck group is isomorphic to a natural submodule of Lusztig's periodic Hecke module. We then provide a categorification of these results by showing that the Kazhdan-Laumon Category O is equivalent to a full subcategory of a suitably-defined category of perverse sheaves on the semi-infinite flag variety.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A central conjecture of Coates and Sujatha predicts that the fine Selmer group of any $p$-adic Galois representation is cotorsion over the relevant Iwasawa algebra with vanishing $\mu$-invariant, generalizing Iwasawa's original conjecture for class groups. In this article, we recast this conjecture in terms of higher Galois cohomological operations called Massey products, stated purely in terms of the residual representation. This characterization implies that if the $\mu$-invariant vanishes for a given $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension, then it also vanishes for all $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions the Greenberg neighbourhood of radius $1/p$. Furthermore, we establish that the unobstructedness of ordinary deformation rings over $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions is equivalent to the vanishing of the $\mu$-invariant of the fine Selmer group attached to the adjoint representation. For ordinary deformation rings attached to $2$-dimensional automorphic Galois representations, we establish a close connection between the Noetherian property and the vanishing of the $\mu$-invariant.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X$ be a compact locally symmetric space associated to $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$ and $Y \subset X$ a maximal flat submanifold, not necessarily closed. Using a Euclidean approximation, we give an upper bound in the spectral aspect for Maass forms integrated against a smooth cutoff function on $Y$ .</p></details>
