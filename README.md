### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16541v1'>2508.16541</a>\]&nbsp; **Minimal value set binomials and Frobenius nonclassical curves**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tiago Aprigio, João Paulo Guardieiro &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we characterize all minimal value set binomials over $\mathbb{F}_q$, that is, binomials whose size of the set of images is the smallest possible. With this information, we also classify all quadrinomial curves with separated variables that are $\mathbb{F}_q$-Frobenius nonclassical for the morphism of lines.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb {F}_q$ be finite field with $q$ elements. Let $\alpha\leqslant n$ be positive integers. Consider the general linear group $\mathrm{GL}(\alpha+n, \mathbb {F}_q) $ and its subgroup $H(n)$, which fixes the first $\alpha$ basis elements in $\mathbb {F}_q^{\alpha+n}$. Denote $\mathcal{A}_n$ by the convolution algebra of $H(n)$-biinvariant functions on $\mathrm{GL}(\alpha+n, \mathbb {F}_q) $. We describe algebras $\mathcal{A}_n$ in terms of generators and relations and show that the family $\mathcal{A}_n$ admits a natural interpolation to arbitrary complex $n$ (the field $\mathbb {F}_q$ and $\alpha$ are fixed).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{u}_\zeta^\vee$ denote the small quantum group associated with a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^\vee$ and a root of unity $\zeta$. In [9], a geometric realization of $Z(\mathfrak{u}_\zeta^\vee)^{G^\vee}$, the $G^\vee$-invariant part of the center of $\mathfrak{u}_\zeta^\vee$, was proposed. We compute the dimension of the geometric subalgebra of the center and in the case where $G=SL_n$, we study a bigraded refinement of the result.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16400v1'>2508.16400</a>\]&nbsp; **The Exceptional Set in Goldbach's Problem with two Chen Primes**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Lasse Grimmelt, Joni Teräväinen &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that all natural numbers $n\equiv 4\pmod 6$ are the sum of two Chen primes (primes $p$ such that $p+2$ has at most two prime factors), apart from a power-saving set of exceptions. This improves on various previous results and is optimal, barring substantial progress on the twin prime or binary Goldbach conjectures. The proof is based on constructing a non-negative model for the Chen primes in a suitable approximate sense. To do this, we develop an efficient sieving strategy that makes use of a power-saving variant of the Bombieri--Vinogradov theorem. Furthermore, we show that the primes are well approximated in additive problems by the Cram\'er model (rough numbers) with a sifting parameter of power size.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this follow-up paper, we again inspect a surprising relationship between the set of $2$-periodic points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ and the coefficient $c$, where $K$ is any number field of degree $n\geq 2$ and $d>2$ is an integer. As before, we again study here counting problems that are inspired by the exciting advances on $2$-torsion point-counting in arithmetic statistics and on $2$-periodic point-counting in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any given prime $p\geq 3$ and any integer $\ell \geq 1$, the average number of distinct $2$-periodic integral points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is bounded (if $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\setminus \{1,p\}$) or zero or unbounded (if $\ell \in \{1,p\}$) as $c$ tends to infinity. Motivated further by $K$-rational periodic point-counting work of Benedetto, along with a conjecture of Hutz on $2$-periodic rational points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ for any given prime $p\geq 5$ and any integer $\ell \geq 1$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove that the average number of distinct $2$-periodic integral points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$ as $c$ tends to infinity. Finally, we then also apply here density and number field-counting results from arithmetic statistics, and as a result obtain again counting and statistical results on the irreducible monic integer polynomials and algebraic number fields arising naturally in our dynamical setting.</p></details>
