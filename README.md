 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Adam J. Harper &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a short survey of the phenomenon of better than squareroot cancellation, specifically as it applies to averages of multiplicative character sums (such as $\frac{1}{r-1} \sum_{χ\; \text{mod} \; r} |\sum_{n \leq x} χ(n)|^{2q}$) thanks to their connection with so-called multiplicative chaos. We focus on the number theoretic aspects of the arguments, and also touch on some possible applications.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gargi Mukherjee &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\overline{p}(n)$ denote the overpartition function, and for $j\in \mathbb{N}$, $Δ^r_j$ denote the $r$-fold applications of the shifted difference operator $Δ_j$ defined by $Δ_j(a)(n):=a(n)-a(n-j)$. The main goal of this paper is to derive an asymptotic expansion of $Δ^r_j(\overline{p})(n)$ with an effective error bound which subsequently gives an answer to a problem of Wang, Xie, and Zhang. In order to get the asymptotics of $Δ^r_j(\overline{p})(n)$, we derive an asymptotic expansion of the shifted overpartition function $\overline{p}(n+k)$ for any integer $k\neq 0$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Dylan Scofield, Hanson Smith &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 26 pages including many examples and constructions, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Following work of Vélez, we explicitly describe the splitting of the integral prime 2 in the radical extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{a})$, where $x^n-a$ is an irreducible polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. With previous work of the second author, this fully describes the splitting of any prime in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{a})$. Using this description, we classify common index divisors (the primes whose splitting prevents the existence of a power integral basis for the ring of integers). Using work of Pleasants, we extend this to describe common $N$-index divisors (primes that divide the index of any order generated over $\mathbb{Z}$ by $N$ elements). We also present two novel constructions of non-monogenic fields with no common index divisors as well as constructions of number rings requiring $N$ ring generators for any $N>1$. Examples are provided throughout.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nadir Matringe &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** We strengthened the globalization lemma 7.3, the previous version not being precise enough to support our conclusion

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a new proof of the epsilon dichotomy conjecture, stated by Prasad and Takloo-Bighash, for non Archimedean local fields of characteristic zero, when the twisting character is trivial. Our method relies on the functional equation and the analytic properties of intertwining periods, instead of trace formula and type theory. It removes the odd residual characteristic restriction in the previous proof, coming from type theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 46 pages. Introduction and abstract updated, references added, redaction improved, section 5 updated

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a commutative algebra $A$ and a quotient $A$-algebra $A/I$, we construct a resolution of $A/I$ as an $A$-module such that it is also a differential graded (dg) algebra with divided powers (PD). This construction makes use of symmetric tensors in the symmetric tensor category of dg $A$-modules and does not require a Noetherian assumption on $A$. Moreover, the resolution has many lifting properties which we leverage to study the homotopy Lie algebra associated to the pair $(A,A/I)$, which is defined as the cohomology of the PD derivations of this PD dg algebra. Finally we investigate the complete intersection case in more details as well as connect it to the finite generation of the Yoneda algebra.</p></details>

> **Comment:** The main result is improved

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb{N}$ be the set of natural numbers and $\mathcal{S}=\big\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2,\cdots\big\}$ the set of squares. Let $\mathcal{W}$ be an additive complement of $\mathcal{S}$ and $$ f(n)=\#\big\{(w,m^2)\in \mathcal{W}\times \mathcal{S}: n=w+m^2\big\}. $$ It is proved that there is an absolute constant $c_0>0$ such that for all large $N$ we have $$ \sum_{n\le N}f(n)-N\ge c_{0}N, $$ which makes some further progress on a 1993 conjecture of Cilleruelo. As consequences of this result, we answer negatively a 2001 problem of Ruzsa as well as a 2017 problem of Ben Green.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 6 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a subset of an additive abelian semigroup and let $hA$ be the $h$-fold sumset of $A$. The following question is considered: Let $(A_q)_{q=1}^{\infty}$ be a strictly decreasing sequence of sets in the semigroup and let $A = \bigcap_{q=1}^{\infty} A_q$. When does one have $$ hA = \bigcap_{q=1}^{\infty} hA_q $$ for some or all $h \geq 2$?</p></details>

> **Comment:** 58 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compare the integral category O of shifted affine quantum groups of symmetric and non symmetric types. To do so we compute the K-theoretic analog of the Coulomb branches with symmetrizers introduced by Nakajima and Weekes. This yields an equivalence of the category O with a module category over a new type of quiver Hecke algebras. At the decategorified level, this establishes a connection between the Grothendieck group of O and a finite-dimensional module over a simple Lie algebra of unfolded symmetric type. We compute this module in certain cases and give a combinatorial rule for its crystal.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 16 pages, no figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The irrationality exponent of a real number measures how well that number can be approximated by rationals. Real numbers with irrationality exponent strictly greater than $2$ are transcendental numbers, and form a set with rich fractal structure. We show that this set intersects the limit set of any parabolic iterated function system arising from the backward continued fraction in a set of full Hausdorff dimension. As a corollary, we show that the set of irrationals whose irrationality exponents are strictly bigger than $2$ and whose backward continued fraction expansions have bounded partial quotients is of Hausdorff dimension $1$. This is a sharp contrast to the fact that there exists no irrational whose irrationality exponent is strictly greater than $2$ and whose regular continued fraction expansion has bounded partial quotients.</p></details>

> **Comment:** The new version restricts the attention to the brick chain filtrations mentioned in the title. The further considerations have been deleted. There are no longer references to $τ$-tilting theory

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We deal with the category of finitely generated modules over an artin algebra $A$. Recall that an object in an abelian category is said to be a brick provided its endomorphism ring is a division ring. Simple modules are, of course, bricks, but in case $A$ is connected and not local, there do exist bricks which are not simple. The aim of this survey is to focus the attention to filtrations of modules where all factors are bricks, with bricks being ordered in some definite way. In general, a module category will have many oriented cycles. Recently, Demonet has proposed to look at so-called brick chains in order to deal with a very interesting directedness feature of a module category. These are the orderings of bricks which we will use. This is a survey which relies on recent investigations by a quite large group of mathematicians. We have singled out some important observations and have reordered them in order to obtain a completely self-contained (and elementary) treatment of the relevance of bricks in a module category. (Most of the papers we rely on are devoted to what is called $τ$-tilting theory, but for the results we are interested in, there is no need to deal with $τ$-tilting, or even with the Auslander-Reiten translation $τ$).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be an arbitrary $p$-adic field and let $G$ be an arbitrary reductive group over $F$ with Langlands dual group $^LG$. We show that the change-of-group morphism of Emerton-Gee stacks $\mathcal{X}_{^LG}\to\mathcal{X}_{GL_d}$ is relatively representable by algebraic stacks of finite presentation over $\mathrm{Spf}\mathbf{Z}_p$ for any embedding $^LG\to GL_d$, which improves the result of \cite{Min25} which says the morphism is representable by locally Noetherian formal algebraic stacks.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The theory of admissible modules over symmetrizable anisotropic Kac-Moody superalgebras, introduced by Kac and Wakimoto in late 80's, is a well-developed subject with many applications, including representation theory of vertex algebras. Recently this theory was developed in a more general setup by Gorelik and Serganova. In the present paper we develop in this more general setup the theory of admissible modules over arbitrary symmetrizable Kac-Moody superalgebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We confirm Chebyshev's observation that primes are strikingly more abundant in non-square residue classes modulo a fixed integer under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) by proving a (natural) density 1 statement for prime counting functions in residue classes where each prime is weighted by its inverse square root. In contrast to the majority of the existing literature on the subject, we do not need to restrict to logarithmic densities to measure Chebyshev's bias and we do not rely on any hypothesis related to L-function zeros that is stronger than GRH.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Please feel free to make comments! (The connection to Schur--Weyl duality has been moved to a separate paper, and some results have been slightly improved.)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a Markov chain with very different mixing rates depending on how mixing is measured. The chain is the "Burnside process on the hypercube $C_2^n$." Started at the all-zeros state, it mixes in a bounded number of steps, no matter how large $n$ is, in $\ell^1$ and in $\ell^2$. And started at general $x$, it mixes in at most $\log n$ steps in $\ell^1$. But, in $\ell^2$, it takes $\frac{n}{\log n}$ steps for most starting $x$. The $\ell^2$ mixing results follow from an explicit diagonalization of the Markov chain into binomial-coefficient-valued eigenvectors.</p></details>

The basis is used to give sharp rates of convergence to stationarity.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 22 pages, 6 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the \emph{chamber zeta function} for a complex of groups, defined via an Euler product over primitive tailless chamber galleries, extending the Ihara--Bass framework from weighted graphs to higher-rank settings. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the Bruhat--Tits building of $\mathrm{PGL}_{3}(F)$ for a non-archimedean local field $F$ with residue field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. For the standard arithmetic quotient $Γ\backslash\mathcal{B}$ with $Γ=\mathrm{PGL}_{3}(\mathbb{F}_{q}[t])$, we prove an Ihara--Bass type \emph{determinant formula} expressing the chamber zeta function as the reciprocal of a characteristic polynomial of a naturally defined chamber transfer operator. In particular, the chamber zeta function is \emph{rational} in its complex parameter. As an application of the determinant formula, we obtain explicit counting results for closed gallery classes arising from tailless galleries in $\mathcal{B}$, including exact identities and spectral asymptotics governed by the chamber operator.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 27 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study relations of $λ_{y}$-classes associated to tautological bundles over the flag manifold of type $C$ in the quantum $K$-ring. These relations are called the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations. The strategy of the proof of the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations is based on the method of semi-infinite flag manifolds and the Borel-type presentation. In addition, we observe that the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations give a complete set of the defining relations of the quantum $K$-ring. This gives a presentation of the quantum $K$-ring of the flag manifold of type $C$, called the Whitney-type presentation, as a quotient of a polynomial ring, different from the Borel-type presentation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine the Aubert duals of strongly positive representations of the metaplectic group \(\widetilde{Sp}(n)\) over a non-Archimedean local field $F$ of characteristic different from two. Using the classification of Matić and an explicit analysis of Jacquet modules, we describe these duals in terms of precise inducing data. Our results extend known descriptions for classical groups to the metaplectic groups case and clarify the role of Aubert duality for non-linear covering groups, providing a foundation for future applications to the study of unitary representations for those cases. Furthermore, We are able to show that the same method applies to odd general spin groups $GSpin(2n+1)$, yielding an explicit description of Aubert duals in that setting as well.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages. Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Refining an argument of the second author, we improve the known bounds for the number of rational points near a submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^d$ of intermediate dimension under a natural curvature condition. Furthermore, in the codimension $2$ case we formulate a conjecture concerning this count. The conjecture is motivated in part by interpreting certain codimension $2$ submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^{2m+2}$ as complex hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^{m+1}$ and using the complex structure to provide a natural reformulation of the curvature condition. Finally, we provide further evidence for the conjecture by proving a natural variant for $n \geq 2$ in which rationals are replaced with Gaussian rationals.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In in a nutshell, the classical geometric $q$-Langlands duality can be viewed as a correspondence between the space of $(G,q)$-opers and the space of solutions of $^L\mathfrak{g}$ XXZ Bethe Ansatz equations. The latter describe spectra of closed spin chains with twisted periodic boundary conditions and, upon the duality, the twist elements are identified with the $q$-oper connections on a projective line in a certain gauge. In this work, we initiate the geometric study of Bethe Ansatz equations for spin chains with open boundary conditions. We introduce the space of $q$-opers whose defining sections are invariant under reflection through the unit circle in a selected gauge. The space of such reflection-invariant $q$-opers in the presence of certain nondegeneracy conditions is thereby described by the corresponding Bethe Ansatz problem. We compare our findings with the existing results in integrable systems and representation theory. This paper discusses the type-A construction leaving the general case for the upcoming work.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical Brun--Titchmarsh theorem gives an upper bound, which is of correct order of magnitude in the full range, for the number of primes $p\leqslant x$ satisfying $p\equiv a\bmod q$. We strengthen this inequality for different ranges of $\log q/\log x$, improving upon previous works by Motohashi, Goldfeld, Iwaniec, Friedlander and Iwaniec, and Maynard for general or special moduli. In particular, we are able to beat Iwaniec's barrier $q<x^{9/20-}$, and improve all existing inequalities in the range $x^{9/20}\ll q<x^{1/2-}$ by utilizing bilinear or trilinear structures in the remainder terms of linear sieve. The proof is based on various estimates for character and exponential sums, which we derive by appealing to arithmetic exponent pairs and bilinear forms with algebraic trace functions from $\ell$-adic cohomology, trilinear forms with Kloosterman fractions, and sums of Kloosterman sums from spectral theory of automorphic forms, as well as large value theorem for Dirichlet polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2003, Hikami and Kirillov uncovered an intriguing connection between torus knots $\mathcal{K}_{(P,Q)}$ and Virasoro minimal models $\mathcal{M}(P,Q)$ by relating the Kashaev invariants of the knots to the characters of the corresponding minimal models. In this work, we recover and extend this connection by combining the 3D--3D correspondence with a bulk--boundary correspondence. More concretely, we study the 3D $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories associated with torus-knot complements via the Dimofte--Gaiotto--Gukov construction and show that, in the infrared, these theories either flow to a unitary TQFT (when $|P-Q| = 1$), whose boundary chiral algebra reproduces that of the associated unitary minimal model, or to a 3D $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 SCFT (when $|P-Q| > 1$), which realizes the corresponding non-unitary chiral minimal model at the boundary after an appropriate topological twist. This framework yields new Nahm-sum-like expressions for the characters of Virasoro minimal models and other related rational conformal field theories, providing a systematic algorithm for constructing characters of rational VOAs directly from the combinatorial data of an ideal triangulation of a non-hyperbolic knot complement.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The α-Kakutani substitution rule splits the unit interval into two subintervals of lengths alpha and 1 - α, for a fixed α in (0,1). A simple inflation-substitution procedure produces tilings of the real line and their associated Delone sets. We show that there are precisely five distinct values of min(α, 1 - α) for which these sets are uniformly spread, meaning that they are a bounded displacement of a lattice. The proof of this surprising fact combines the construction and analysis of a related family of primitive substitution tilings, Solomon's criterion for uniform spreadness, and a classification of Pisot-Vijayaraghavan polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For simple, simply-connected compact Lie groups, Dynkin embedding indices obey a universal scaling law with a direct topological meaning. Given an inclusion $f:G\hookrightarrow H$, the Dynkin embedding index $j_f$ is characterized equivalently by the induced maps on $π_3$ and on the canonical generators of $H^3$, $H^4(B{-})$, and $H^4(Σ{-})$. Consequently, $j_f$ controls instanton-number scaling, the quantization levels of Chern--Simons and Wess--Zumino--Witten terms, and the matching of gauge couplings and one-loop RG scales. We connect this picture to representation theory via the $β$-construction in topological $K$-theory, relating Dynkin indices to Chern characters through Harris' degree--$3$ formula and Naylor's suspended degree--$4$ refinement. Finally, we apply these results to F-theory to explain the prevalence of index-one matter: we propose a ``genericity heuristic'' where geometry favors regular embeddings (typically $j_f=1$) associated with minimal singularity enhancements, while higher-index embeddings require non-generic tuning.</p></details>

Our approach builds on previous arguments of Bombieri, Fouvry, Friedlander, and Iwaniec appealing to spectral theory of Kloosterman sums, as well as the $q$-analogue of van der Corput method. In particular, we need estimates for exponential sums coming from the spectral theory of automorphic forms (sums of Kloosterman sums) and from algebraic geometry (Weil--Deligne bound for algebraic exponential sums). As an application, we show that the greatest prime factor of $p + 6$ for Chen prime $p$ is infinitely often greater than $p^{0.217}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This work is devoted to the study of representations of finite subgroups of the group of units of quaternion division algebras over a global or local field arising from the inclusion via extension of scalars splitting the algebra. Following a question by Serre, we study the set $\mathrm{IF}$ of conjugacy classes of integral representations that are conjugates of the given representation over the field. The set $\mathrm{IF}$ is often called the set of integral forms in the literature. In previous works we have seen that, for a given representation, the set $\mathrm{IF}$ can be indexed by the vertex set of a suitable subgraph of the Bruhat-Tits tree for the special linear group. In this work, we describe a construction that allows the simultaneous study of the set $\mathrm{IF}$ over different splitting fields. For this, we devise and use a theory of twisted Galois form of Bruhat-Tits trees. With this tool, we explicitly compute, in most cases, the cardinality of $\mathrm{IF}$ for the representation of the classical quaternion group of order $8$ studied by Serre, Feit and others, as much as for other similar groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Keating--Snaith conjecture for orthogonal families may be viewed as analogous to a Gaussian distribution with a negative mean, and the possibility that mixed moments resemble a composition of independent moments, these two insights were combined and applied in Lester and Radziwi{łł}'s proof of quantum unique ergodicity for half-integral weight automorphic forms, via Soundararajan's method under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH). This observation also yields a crucial and nontrivial saving in the resolution of certain arithmetic problems. Inspired by this, we select a series of typical mixed orthogonal families of $L$-functions: $\mathrm{GL}_2$ quadratic twisted families, Gao and Zhao established a sharp upper bound by building upon Harper's method, and one can replace square-free numbers with primes in this argument. Under the assumptions of the GRH and the Generalized Ramanujan Conjecture, we present the following three arithmetic applications: i) The decorrelation of Fourier coefficients of half-integral weight modular forms, specifically, a variant of Selberg orthogonality for distinct half-integral weight modular forms. ii) The decorrelation of automorphic periods averaged over prime imaginary quadratic fields. iii) The decorrelation of the analytic orders of isotropy subgroups of Tate--Shafarevich groups of elliptic curves under prime quadratic twists.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We discuss the asymptotics of the Archimedean part of the Arakelov intersection number. The theorem is motivated by recent conjectures and their proof strategy by Gao and Zhang on the Northcott property of the Beilinson--Bloch height pairing. Our method involves a homological algebra interpretation of the Archimedean height by Hain. This interpretation allows us to introduce motivic viewpoints using Deligne cohomology, cycle class maps and higher Chow groups. Especially, we compare the biextension by Hain and Brosnan--Pearlstein over $\mathbb{C}$ based on Poincaré line bundle and Hodge theory with the $\mathbb{G}_{\mathrm{m}}$-biextension of Bloch and Seibold defined by two families of homologically trivial cycles on a generically smooth family of projective varieties over a smooth curve. Our comparison, a relative version of the work of Gorchinskiy, enhances his derived viewpoint on these biextensions. Especially when the family of varieties are smooth, the two constructions are related via derived regulator maps to Deligne cohomology, reinterpreted similarly to Beilinson's absolute Hodge cohomology, as well as the derived description of Hardouin's biextension that generalizes Poincaré line bundle by Hain. The comparison when the family defined over a smooth curve has a strongly semistable reduction further involves a simple monodromy computation using mixed Hodge modules. Along our discussion, we simplify the discussion of Bloch and Seibold, partly in the style of Gorchinskiy. For example, the symmetry of their biextension is proved more easily than their work.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a stably birational classification for algebraic tori of dimensions $3$ and $4$ over a field $k$. First, we define the weak stably equivalence of algebraic tori and show that there exist $13$ (resp. $128$) weak stably equivalent classes of algebraic tori $T$ of dimension $3$ (resp. $4$) which are not stably rational by computing some cohomological stably birational invariants, e.g. the Brauer-Grothendieck group of $X$ where $X$ is a smooth compactification of $T$, provided by Kunyavskii, Skorobogatov and Tsfasman. We make a procedure to compute such stably birational invariants effectively and the computations are done by using the computer algebra system GAP. Second, we define the $p$-part of the flabby class $[\hat{T}]^{fl}$ as a $\mathbb{Z}_p[{\rm Syl}_p(G)]$-lattice and prove that they are faithful and indecomposable $\mathbb{Z}_p[{\rm Syl}_p(G)]$-lattices unless it vanishes for $p=2$ (resp. $p=2,3$) in dimension $3$ (resp. $4$) via $p$-adic analysis. The $\mathbb{Z}_p$-ranks of them are also given. Third, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for which two not stably rational algebraic tori $T$ and $T^\prime$ of dimensions $3$ (resp. $4$) are stably birationally equivalent in terms of the splitting fields and the weak stably equivalent classes of $T$ and $T^\prime$. In particular, the splitting fields of them should coincide if $\hat{T}$ and $\hat{T}^\prime$ are indecomposable. Forth, for each $7$ cases of not stably but retract rational algebraic tori of dimension $4$, we find an algebraic torus $T^\prime$ of dimension $4$ which satisfies that $T\times_k T^\prime$ is stably rational. Finally, we give a criteria to determine whether two algebraic tori $T$ and $T^\prime$ of general dimensions are stably birationally equivalent when $T$ (resp. $T^\prime$) is stably birationally equivalent to some algebraic torus $T^{\prime\prime}$ of dimension up to $4$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $R$ be a commutative Noetherian local ring. We characterize when its completion has an isolated singularity, thereby strengthening the Dao-Takahashi refinement of the Auslander-Huneke-Leuschke-Wiegand theorem. We investigate the ascent and descent of finite and countable syzygy representation type along the canonical map from $R$ to its completion. One consequence is a complete affirmative answer to Schreyer's conjecture. We explore analogues of Chen's questions in the context of finite Cohen-Macaulay representation type over Cohen-Macaulay rings. The main result in this direction shows that if $R$ is Cohen-Macaulay and there are only finitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules that are locally free on the punctured spectrum, then either $R$ is a hypersurface or every Gorenstein projective module is projective; moreover, every Gorenstein projective module over the completion of $R$ is a direct sum of finite generated ones. Finally, we study dominant local rings, introduced by Takahashi, under certain finite representation type conditions, and identify a new class of virtually Gorenstein rings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Monstrous moonshine relates the representation of the Monster finite sporadic simple group to the distinguished modular functions, called Hauptmoduln. Chen-Yui~\cite{Chen-Yui} showed that the CM values of Hauptmoduln which appeare in monstrous moonshine (but not all) are algebraic integers, which is similar to the singular moduli of the $j$-function. In this paper, we generalize this result to Hauptmoduln whose $q$-coefficients are cyclotomic integers. A main idea for our proof is the use of generalized modular equations for Hauptmoduln, which was introduced by Cummins-Gannon~\cite{Cummins-Gannon} in the study of monstrous moonshine. As an application, we show that if a formal $q$-series satisfies the special combinatoric property called complete replicability, its CM values are algebraic integers, without assuming the modular invariance.</p></details>

We study the behavior of the Tate--Shafarevich group of $E$ under quadratic extensions $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})/\mathbb{Q}$. By analyzing the cokernel of the restriction map, without assuming the finiteness of the Tate--Shafarevich group, we prove that the ratio $\frac{\#\Sha(E/\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D}))[4]}{\#\Sha(E_D/\mathbb{Q})[2]}$ and $\#\Sha(E_D/\mathbb{Q})[2]$ can, under some conditions on $E/\mathbb{Q}$, grow arbitrarily large simultaneously, where $E_D$ denotes the quadratic twist of $E$ by $D$. For elliptic curves of the form $E : y^2 = x^3 + px$ with $p\equiv 1 \bmod 4$ being an odd prime, assuming the finiteness of the relevant Tate--Shafarevich groups, we prove that $\#\Sha(E/\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D}))[2] \leq 4$ and $\Sha(E_D/\mathbb{Q})[2] = 0$ for infinitely many square-free integers $D$ with $-D$ being a prime number. Additionally, $\Sha(E/\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-D}))[2]\neq 0$ for all $D$ when $p=257$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Sierpinski's Hypothesis H1, formulated in 1958, is the conjecture that (provided $n\geq 2$), when the first $n^2$ counting numbers, $1, 2,3,\dots n^2$, are arranged in a square, then each row contains at least one prime. This conjecture is particularly interesting in that it subsumes and is stronger than both the Oppermann and Legrendre conjectures. Herein I shall verify Sierpinski's Hypothesis H1 for (at least) the first $n \leq \hbox{4 553 432 387} \approx 4.5 \hbox{ billion}$ of these Sierpinski matrices. I shall also demonstrate some partial but more general results. For example: Even for arbitrary $n\geq \hbox{4 553 432 388}$ at least one quarter of the rows of the $n$th Sierpinski matrix contain at least one prime. Furthermore, even for arbitrary $n\geq \hbox{4 553 432 388}$ at least the first $\hbox{131 294}$ rows of the $n$th Sierpinski matrix always contain at least one prime. These and related results are obtained largely by using the locations and values of the known maximal prime gaps, the pigeonhole principle, and some recent bounds on the first Chebyshev function.</p></details>

Our approach is characteristic-free and applies to any submonoid $\mathcal{M}(n)$ of the partial transformation monoid on an $n$-element set that contains the symmetric group. To achieve this, we introduce and study a functor from the category of rational representations of the monoid of $n \times n$ matrices to the category of finite dimensional representations of $\mathcal{M}(n)$. We establish two branching rules. Our main results describe graded module structures of orbit harmonics quotients for the rook, partial transformation, and full transformation monoids. This yields analogs of the Cauchy decomposition for polynomial rings in $n\times n$ variables.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 58 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this series of papers, we investigate properties of a finite group which are determined by its low degree irreducible representations over a number field $F$, i.e. its representations on matrix rings $\mathrm{M}_n(D)$ with $n \leq 2$. In particular we focus on representations on $\mathrm{M}_2(D)$ where $D$ is a division algebra having an order $\mathcal{O}$ such that $\mathcal{O}$ has finitely many units, i.e. such that $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathcal{O})$ has arithmetic rank $1$. In this first part, the focus is on two aspects. One aspect concerns characterisations of such representing spaces in terms of Serre's homological goodness property, small virtual cohomological dimension and higher Kleinian-type embeddings. As an application, we obtain several characterisations of the finite groups $G$ whose irreducible representations are of the mentioned form. In particular, such groups $G$ are precisely those such that $\mathcal{U}(R G)$, with $R$ the ring of integers of $F$, can be constructed from groups which virtually map onto a non-abelian free group. Along the way we investigate the latter property for congruence subgroups of higher modular groups and its implications for the congruence kernel. This is used to obtain new information on the congruence kernel of the unit group of a group ring. The second aspect concerns the conjugacy classes of the images of finite subgroups of $\mathcal{U}(R G)$ under the irreducible representations of $G$. More precisely, we initiate the study of a blockwise variant of the Zassenhaus conjectures and the subgroup isomorphism problem. Moreover, we contribute to them for the low rank representations above.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Permutation polynomials over finite fields have extensive applications in various areas. Particularly, permutation polynomials with simple forms are of great interest. In recent papers, several classes of permutation polynomials of the form $L(X)+Tr_q^{q^3}(h(X))$ have been constructed. This paper further investigates permutation polynomials of such form over $\mathbb{F}_{q^3}$. Unlike previous studies, we transform the problem of constructing univariate permutation polynomials over finite fields into that of constructing corresponding multivariate permutations over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$-vector spaces. Through this approach, we completely characterize a class of permutation polynomials of the form $L(X)+γTr_q^{q^3}(c_1X+c_2X^2+c_3X^3+c_4X^{q+2})$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^3}$, where $q=2^m$, $L(X)=X^q+aX$ and $a,c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4,γ\in\mathbb{F}_q$ with $a^2+a+1\neq0$.

The compactification $X$ can be chosen to be a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial log Fano variety whenever $U$ is $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial. Furthermore, we prove that a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial klt Fano variety $X$ is of cluster type if and only if its Cox ring ${\rm Cox}(X)$ is a ${\rm Cl}(X)$-graded mutation semigroup algebra. In order to enlighten the previous theorems, we provide several explicit examples motivated by birational geometry, representation theory, and combinatorics.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zeraoulia Rafik, Pedro Caceres &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** This revision strengthens results on congruences for iterates of the sum--power divisor function, proves the uniqueness of \(n=6\) in the prime--\(L\) multiperfect case, fills gaps in earlier proofs, and introduces an entropy-based dynamical study with conjectural links to Robin-type criteria and GUE statistics

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Inspired by Cohen and te Riele~\cite{Cohen1996}, who computationally verified that for every $n \leq 400$ there exists $k$ such that $σ^k(n) \equiv 0 \pmod{n}$ (where $σ^k$ denotes the $k$-fold iteration of the sum-of-divisors function), this paper resolves their reverse question negatively: no integer $n > 1$ satisfies $σ^k(n) \equiv 0 \pmod{n}$ for \emph{all} $k \geq 1$. The proof eliminates prior gaps via Lenstra's density-zero bounds $σ_k(m) \ll m / \log\log m$ combined with Robin's RH-equivalent criterion $σ(n) < e^γn \log\log n + 0.6483 n / \log\log n$ ($n \geq 5041$), showing universal metaperfect divisibility implies RH-violating $σ$ growth or low-lying zeta zeros near $s=1$. Among multiperfect $n$ with prime $L = \mathrm{lcm}(1+e_p : p \mid n)$, only $n=6$ satisfies the congruence for all odd $k$, with Shannon entropy $H(σ^k(6) \mod 6) \to \log 2$ reflecting periodic order. We analyze bifurcation phenomena in the dynamics $σ^k(n) \mod n$, where high-entropy chaotic residues for other $n$ mirror GUE statistics of zeta zeros ($\sim \log T / 2π$ near $s=1/2$, $>41\%$ verified on critical line), contrasting the ordered $n=6$ case. Zero rates near $s=1$ (simple pole) and $s=1/2$ bound iterated $σ$ distributions, linking to RH via divisor sums and dynamical bifurcations; we conjecture $n=6$ uniquely achieves odd-$k$ divisibility with small period dividing $L$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the full Fock--Goncharov conjecture for $\mathcal{A}_{SL_2,Σ_{g,p}}$, the $\mathcal{A}$-cluster variety of the moduli of decorated twisted $SL_2$-local systems on triangulable surfaces $Σ_{g,p}$ with at least 2 punctures. Equivalently, we show that the tagged skein algebra $Sk^{ta}(Σ)$, or the middle cluster algebra $\mathrm{mid}(\mathcal{A})$, coincides with the upper cluster algebra $U(Σ)$. Inspired by the work of Shen--Sun--Weng, we introduce the localized cluster variety $\mathring{\mathcal{A}}$ as the algebraic version of the decorated Teichmüller space $\mathcal{T}^d(Σ)$. We show its global section $Γ(\mathring{\mathcal{A}},\mathcal{O}_{\mathring{\mathcal{A}}})$ equals the classical Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_{q\to1}(Σ)$, thereby providing a quantization of $\mathcal{T}^d(Σ)$ in terms of the Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_q(Σ)$. As a consequence of our geometric characterizations, we deduce normality and the Gorenstein property of the tagged skein algebra $Sk^{ta}(Σ)$ and the classical Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_{q\to1}(Σ)$, as well as finite generation of upper cluster algebra $U(Σ)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Prime Number Theorem asserts that the density of primes less than or equal to $N$ is asymptotically equal to $1/\log N$. The density of prime triples in coprime triples in $\mathbb{Z}^3_+$ is determined to be $3ζ(3)/\log N$, where $ζ$ is the Riemann zeta function. In this paper, we prove that the density of prime triples in coprime triples in the surface $S=\{z_0^{2} - z_1^{2} + z_2^{2} - z_0z_2=0\}$ is greater than $3ζ(3)/\log N$, meaning that $S$ meets primes more frequently.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $N_d(G,X)$ denote the number of degree $d$ extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ with Galois closure $G$ and $|Δ_K|\leq X$. Malle's conjecture predicts an asymptotic of the form $N_d(G,X)\sim CX^α(\log X)^β$. Previously, Klüners proved Malle's conjecture for $G=C_2 \wr S_4$. His proof gives a power savings of $O(X^{7/8})$. We improve Klüners' result by establishing a stronger power saving error term for the count of such fields. Specifically, we show $N_8(C_2\wr S_4,X)=CX+O(X^{3/4-1/30})$. Additionally, we obtain new bounds on $N_8(G,X)$ for the groups $S_4$, $C_2^3 \rtimes S_4$, $GL_2 (\mathbb{F}_3)$, and $Q_8\rtimes S_4$ as permutation subgroups of $S_8$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We find exact identities for sums of the form \begin{equation*}\label{eq:convsumabs} \sum_{\stackrel{n_1+n_2 = n}{n_1 \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{ 0, n \} }} Q(n_1,n_2) σ_{-r_1}(n_1) σ_{-r_2}(n_2), \end{equation*} where $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $r_1,r_2\in\mathbb{C}$, $Q$ is a combination of hypergeometric functions, and $σ_{a}(x)$ denotes the divisor function. Specifically, we find that they can be expressed in terms of Fourier coefficients of Hecke cusp forms weighted by their $L$-values. This result expands upon previous work with Radchenko in which such identities were found for divisor functions with even integer index \cite{FKLR} and encompasses results of Jacobi \cite{motohashi1994binary} and Diamantis and O'Sullivan in \cite{diamantis2010kernels, o2023identities} for divisor functions with odd integer index. The proof of our result expresses these sums in terms of Estermann zeta functions and uses trace formulae. In addition, we use a regularization of divergent convolution sums to provide a mathematical explanation for $L$-values (non-critical in the sense of Deligne) appearing in modular graph functions \cite{DKS2021_2}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we study the Zariski closure of modular points in the two-dimensional universal deformation space when the residual Galois representation is reducible. Unlike the previous approaches in the residually irreducible case from Gouvêa-Mazur, Böckle and Allen, our method relies on local-global compatibility results, potential pro-modularity arguments and a non-ordinary finiteness result between the local deformation ring at $p$ and the global deformation ring. This allows us to construct sufficiently many non-ordinary regular de Rham points whose modularity is guaranteed by the recent progress on the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture. Also, we will discuss some applications of our main results, including the equidimensionality of certain big Hecke algebras and big $R=\mathbb{T}$ theorems in the residually reducible case.</p></details>
