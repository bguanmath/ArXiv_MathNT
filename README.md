<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Terwilliger algebras of association schemes over an arbitrary field $\mathbb{F}$ were called the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of association schemes in [9]. In this paper, we study the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of factorial association schemes. We determine the centers, the semisimplicity, the Jacobson radicals and their nilpotent indices, the Wedderburn-Artin decompositions of the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of factorial association schemes. Moreover, we determine all Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of factorial association schemes that are the symmetric $\mathbb{F}$-algebras or the Frobenius $\mathbb{F}$-algebras.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-27 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Eric M. Schmid Jr., Fernando Tohmé, William Chin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct Grothendieck topologies on the path category of a finite graph, examining both coarse and discrete cases that offer different perspectives on quiver representations. The coarse topology declares each vertex covered by all incoming morphisms, giving the minimal non-trivial Grothendieck topology where sheaves correspond to dual representations via dualization. The discrete topology is the finest possible, forcing sheaves to be locally constant with isomorphic restriction maps. We verify these satisfy Grothendieck's axioms, characterize their sheaf categories, and establish functorial relationships between them. Sheaves on the coarse site arise naturally from quiver representations through dualization, while discrete sheaves correspond to representations of the groupoid completion. This work suggests intermediate topologies could capture subtler representation-theoretic phenomena.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Improved presentation and constants. 49 pages This combines and replaces the manuscripts arXiv:2507.10037 and arxiv:2507.13298 (which will not be published), with additional results and improvements

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that every graph with average degree $d$ and smallest adjacency eigenvalue $|\lambda_n|\leq d^{\gamma}$ contains a clique of size $d^{1-O(\gamma)}$. A simple corollary of this yields the first polynomial bound for Chowla's cosine problem (1965): for every finite set $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, the minimum of the cosine polynomial satisfies $$\min_{x\in [0, 2\pi]}\sum_{a\in A}\cos(ax)\leq -|A|^{1/10-o(1)}.$$ Another application makes significant progress on the problem of MaxCut in $H$-free graphs initiated by Erd\H{o}s and Lov\'asz in the 1970's. We show that every $m$-edge graph with no clique of size $m^{1/2-\delta}$ has a cut of size at least $m/2+m^{1/2+\varepsilon}$ for some $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(\delta)>0$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Adapting Reiher's proof of Kemnitz's conjecture, we obtain two refinements of a theorem of Schmid and Zhuang. Our main results provide improved upper bounds for the Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv constant of rank-two-like $p$-groups, and their direct products with cyclic groups of order coprime to $p$. In particular, we determine the exact value of this constant, and also confirm a conjecture of Gao, for a new infinite family of groups of arbitrarily large rank.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Rooted trees are essential for describing numerical schemes via the so-called B-series. They have also been used extensively in rough analysis for expanding solutions of singular Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs). When one considers scalar-valued equations, the most efficient combinatorial set is multi-indices. In this paper, we investigate the existence of intermediate combinatorial sets that will lie between multi-indices and rooted trees. We provide a negative result stating that there is no combinatorial set encoding elementary differentials in dimension $d\neq 1$, and compatible with the rooted trees and the multi-indices aside from the rooted trees. This does not close the debate of the existence of such combinatorial sets, but it shows that it cannot be obtained via a naive and natural approach.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23430v1'>2510.23430</a>\]&nbsp; **On the Martin boundary for discrete TASEP**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-27 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Vadim Gorin, Sergei Korotkikh &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.PR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a problem with three equivalent formulations: describing Gibbs measures for five-vertex model in quadrant; classifying coherent systems on a p-deformation of the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph related to Grothendieck polynomials; finding the Martin boundary for discrete time TASEP with p-geometric jumps. We find a wide family of the Gibbs measures, parameterized by certain analytic functions. A subset of our measures have probabilistic interpretation as interacting particle systems with fixed particles speeds. In contrast to previous related boundary problems, we find that admissible speeds are not arbitrary, but must be larger than $\frac{p}{1-p}$. For this subset we further establish Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem, connecting the fluctuations to families of independent GUE eigenvalues. As a consequence, the measures from the subset are extreme points of the Martin boundary. It remains open whether our list of measures is exhaustive.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-27 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Junseo Ko &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 25 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which an odd nilpotent element in $\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$ lies inside an $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$-subalgebra. In the case of the classical Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_m$, every nilpotent element can be embedded into an $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-subalgebra, which is the result of the Jacobson-Morozov Theorem. In the case of the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$, we define super Jordan matrices and prove that an odd nilpotent element $e$ is contained in an $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$-subalgebra if and only if $e$ lies in the orbit of a super Jordan matrix consisting only of super Jordan blocks of odd size.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-27 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hajime Kaneko, Bill Mance &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.LO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 23 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we consider recurrence sequences $x_n=\xi_1 \alpha_1^n+\xi_2 \alpha_2^n$ ($n=0,1,\ldots$) with companion polynomial $P(X)$. For example, the sequence $x_n=\xi_1(4+\sqrt{2})^n+\xi_2(4-\sqrt{2})^n$ satisfies the recurrence $x_{n+2}-8x_{n+1}+14x_n=0$ and has companion polynomial $P(X)=X^2-8X+14=(X-4-\sqrt{2})(X-4+\sqrt{2})$. We call $(\xi_1,\xi_2)$ normal with respect to the recurrence relation determined by $P(X)$ when $(x_n)_{n\ge 0}$ is uniformly distributed modulo one. Determining the Borel complexity of the set of normal vectors for a fixed recurrence sequence is unresolved even for most geometric progressions. Under certain assumptions, we prove that the set of normal vectors is $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_3^0$-complete. A special case is the new result that the sets of numbers normal in base $\alpha$, i.e. $\{\xi\in \mathbb{R}\mid (\xi\alpha^n)_{n\geq 0}\mbox{ is u.d. modulo one.} \}$, are $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_3^0$-complete for every real number $\alpha$ with $|\alpha|$ Pisot. We analyze the fractional parts of recurrence sequences in terms of finite words via certain numeration systems. One of the difficulties in proving the main result is that even when recurrence sequences are uniformly distributed modulo one, it is not known what the average frequencies of the digits in the corresponding digital expansions are or if they even must exist.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 5 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give an elementary proof of the statement that if an idempotent complete additive category has weak kernels and weak cokernels, then it has $n$-kernels if and only if it has $n$-cokernels, where $n$ is a nonnegative integer. As a consequence, elementary proofs of two results concerning the equality between the global dimensions of certain right and left module categories are obtained.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 26 pages. Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate variations of Selmer ranks under quadratic twists satisfying the Heegner hypothesis. In particular, starting with an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ with partial $2$-torsion and a common relaxed Selmer group, we derive explicit formulae describing the effect of twisting on Selmer ranks in terms of matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{2}$. As an application, we show that these formulae are compatible with predictions made by the parity conjecture.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages. Comments are welcome! Local references are fixed in v2

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an explicit surjectivity result for products of non-isotrivial, non-isogenous elliptic curves over a function field of arbitrary characteristic. This is by way of an isogeny degree bound in this setting, generated from bounds for elliptic curves by Griffon--Pazuki, and techniques originated by Serre and Masser--W\"{u}stholz in the number field setting. We apply our result to prove that most members of a family of products of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ with no extra endomorphisms have no exceptional primes above a specified constant which depends neither on the elliptic curve factors nor on the dimension of the product.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we give a geometric model for non-homogeneous tubes of the cluster category of the affine type $D$. This model is given in terms of homotopy classes of unoriented arcs in the twice punctured disk. In particular, we extend the geometric model for the tube of rank $n-2$ given in arXiv:2407.11232 to the two tubes of rank $2$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 77 pages. v3: The abstract and the introduction were rewritten. "Main Speculation" in the previous version is now called a conjecture. Proposition 4.5 has been added. The nefness of raised line bundle was defined and added in the assumptions of the conjecture

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a new framework for studying the distribution of rational points on DM stacks of positive characteristic. Our primary focus is on wild stacks, which existing frameworks do not address. There was not even a satisfactory notion of heights for such stacks. First, we introduce a new kind of height function that extends the authors' idea from their preceding paper on characteristic-zero stacks. This new height function is more general and flexible than the previous one. Examples of the new height function include discriminants of torsors, minimal discriminants, and conductors of elliptic curves in characteristic three. Next, we formulate a generalization of the Batyrev-Manin conjecture for rational points of DM stacks in positive characteristic relative to this new type of height function. We provide several pieces of evidence for this generalization.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-27 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Edmund Karasiewicz, Shuichiro Takeda &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct some Iwahori types, in the sense of Bushnell-Kutzko, for the double cover of an almost simple simply-laced simply-connected Chevalley group $\Gt$ over any $2$-adic field. These types capture the covering group analog of the Bernstein block of unramified principal series. We also prove that the associated Hecke algebra essentially admits an Iwahori-Matsumoto (IM) presentation. The complete presentation is obtained for types $A_{r}$, $D_{2r+1}$, $E_{6}$, $E_{7}$; for the other types, some technical obstacles remain. Those Hecke algebras with the complete IM presentation are isomorphic to Iwahori-Hecke algebras of explicit linear Chevalley groups, giving rise to Shimura correspondences. Along the way, we show that the Iwahori type extends to a hyperspecial maximal compact subgroup $\Kt\subseteq \Gt$. This extension has minimal depth among the genuine $\Kt$-representations and allows us to construct a finite Shimura correspondence, generalizing a result of Savin.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Denote by $\pi(x;q,a)$ the number of primes $p\leqslant x$ with $p\equiv a\bmod q.$ We prove new upper bounds for $\pi(x;q,a)$ when $q$ is a large prime very close to $\sqrt{x}$, improving upon the classical work of Iwaniec (1982). The proof reduces to bounding a quintilinear sum of Kloosterman sums, to which we introduce a new shifting argument inspired by Vinogradov--Burgess--Karatsuba, going beyond the classical Fourier-analytic approach thanks to a deep algebro-geometric result of Kowalski--Michel--Sawin on sums of products of Kloosterman sums.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This work follows the spirit of Andrews' series of papers on Partition Analysis. In $2011$, Savage and Sills found new sum sides for the little G\"ollnitz identities and provided their partition interpretations. It turns out that similar companions exist for a mod $8$ partition identity due to Andrews. In this work, we use MacMahon's Partition Analysis to study partitions related to these identities. We find refined generating functions for them, where we keep track of the size of each part. Finally, by considering the alternating sum and Schmidt weight, we show the application of these refined functions in the study of partition statistics.</p></details>

As a combinatorial realization, we establish an algebra homomorphism from the universal Bannai--Ito algebra onto the Terwilliger algebra of an odd graph. This homomorphism provides a unified description of Leonard triples on all irreducible modules over the Terwilliger algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let K be a non-archimedean local field and phi: P^1 -> P^1 a rational endomorphism of degree d >= 2 defined over K. We relate the reduction of phi to the Galois action on its preimage towers by introducing the *orbital colimit* G_{O+(x)} := colim_n Im(rho_{phi^n(x)}), a canonical Galois object encoding the dynamics along a forward orbit. Our main theorem (Theorem 3.1) gives a precise equivalence: phi has *strict good reduction* if and only if there exists a nonempty open set of integral points x in P^1(O_K) whose reductions avoid the reduced postcritical set PC(tilde{phi}), such that the reduced level-1 fibers have degree d and are etale -- equivalently, the associated fiber polynomials have unit leading coefficient and unit discriminant. In particular, for every such x, the extensions K(X_n(x))/K are unramified for all n >= 1. This yields a dynamical Neron--Ogg--Shafarevich criterion in arboreal terms, valid on the natural open locus. We provide complete proofs and explicit examples over Q_p.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the cohomology of $C_n(X)$, the moduli space of commuting $n$-by-$n$ matrices satisfying the equations defining a variety $X$. This space can be viewed as a non-commutative Weil restriction from the algebra of $n$-by-$n$ matrices to the ground field. We introduce a ``Fermionic" counterpart $S_n(X)$, constructed as a convolution $X^n \times^{S_n} \mathrm{GL}_n/\mathrm{T}_n$. Our main result establishes that a natural map $\sigma \colon S_n(X) \to C_n(X)$ induces an isomorphism on $\ell$-adic cohomology under mild conditions on $X$ or the characteristic of the field. This confirms a heuristic derived from the classical theory of Weil restrictions and highlights a version of Boson-Fermion correspondence. Furthermore, we derive explicit combinatorial formulae for the Betti numbers of $C_n(X)$ and a Macdonald-type generating series. Finally we prove a Hermitian variant of our main result.</p></details>

For $h \in \mathbb{N}$, we prove there is some constant $k_h \in \mathbb{N}$ such that if $k > k_h$, then $R(h,k)$ is the entire interval $\left[hk-h+1,\binom{h+k-1}{h}\right]$ except for a specified set of $\binom{h-1}{2}$ numbers. Moreover, we show that one can take $k_3 = 2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Kedlaya proves certain formula describing explicitly the Frobenius structure on a hypergeometric equation. In this paper, we give a generalization of it. In our case, the Frobenius matrix is no longer described by p-adic gamma function, and then we describe it by the p-adic polygamma functions. Since the p-adic polygamma values are linear combinations of p-adic L-values of Dirichlet characters, it turns out that the Frobenius matrix is described by p-adic L-values. Our result has an application to the study on Frobenius on p-adic cohomology. We show that, for a projective smooth family such that the Picard-Fuchs equation is a hypergeometric equation, the Frobenius matrix on the log-crystalline cohomology is described by some values of the logarithmic function and p-adic L-functions of Dirichlet characters.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a new construction of vertex operators of the elliptic quantum toroidal algebra $U_{t_1,t_2,p}(\mathfrak{gl}_{N,tor})$ by combining representations of the algebra and formulas of the elliptic stable envelopes for the $A^{(1)}_{N-1}$ quiver variety ${\cal M}(v,w)$. Compositions of the vertex operators turn out consistent to the shuffle product formula of the elliptic stable envelopes. Their highest to highest expectation values provide K-theoretic vertex functions for ${\cal M}(v,w)$. We also derive exchange relation of the vertex operators and construct a $L$-operator satisfying the $RLL=LLR^*$ relation with $R$ and $R^*$ being elliptic dynamical $R$-matrices defined as transition matrices of the elliptic stable envelopes. Assuming a universal form of $L$ and defining a comultiplication $\Delta$ in terms of it, we show that our vertex operators are intertwining operators of the $U_{t_1,t_2,p}(\mathfrak{gl}_{N,tor})$-modules w.r.t $\Delta$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we analyze the theta series associated to the quadratic form $Q(\mathbf{x}) := x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2$ with congruence conditions on $x_i$ modulo $2, 3, 4$, and $6$. By employing special operators on modular, non-holomorphic Eisenstein series of weight $2$, we construct a basis for the Eisenstein space for levels $2^k$ (with $k \le 7$), $3^{\ell}$ (with $\ell \le 3$), and $p$, where $p>3$ is an odd prime. Using the relation between the trace of Frobenius on an elliptic curve and the Fourier coefficients of the cusp-form part of the theta series corresponding to $Q$, we establish a relation between the number of integer solutions to the equation $Q(\mathbf{x}) = p$ and the number of $\mathbb{F}_p$-rational points on the associated elliptic curve under certain congruence conditions on $p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove explicit Erd\H{o}s--Wintner bounds for Cantor series via a simple trailing-window decomposition. We temporarily discard the last block of digits (the ``window'') and analyze the remaining prefix. The resulting bound has three contributions: (i) a bridge loss from discarding the window; (ii) a variance-type tail for the prefix; and (iii) a regime-dependent smoothing term (Esseen, bounded density, or cancellation of the third cumulant). Optimizing the window length yields rates that are explicit in the sample size. In the fixed-base (q-adic) case we recover Delange's product and obtain effective convergence bounds; the same scheme applies unchanged to Cantor series. We also include a brief guide indicating when each regime is preferable.</p></details>

Under suitable conditions on $U$ and $V$, we prove that this functor satisfies the usual properties of induction functors, such as Frobenius reciprocity, functorial property for compositions, and an analogue of Artin's induction theorem for certain associated characters. To better understand the effect of this functor, we explicitly determine the finite induction of irreducible modules for standard subVOAs of the rank-one lattice/affine VOA $V_{A_1}$, as well as the finite induction of irreducible modules over a parabolic-type subVOA $V_P$ of the rank-two lattice/affine VOA $V_{A_2}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper addresses the interactions between three properties that a group algebra or more generally a pointed Hopf algebra may possess: being noetherian, having finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, and satisfying the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence. First it is shown that the second and third of these properties are equivalent for group algebras $kG$ of polycyclic-by-finite groups, and are, in turn, equivalent to $G$ being nilpotent-by-finite. In characteristic $0$, this enables us to extend this equivalence to certain cocommutative Hopf algebras. In sections 3 and 4 of the paper finiteness conditions for group algebras are studied. Thus in $\S$3 we examine when a group algebra satisfies the Goldie conditions, while in the final section we discuss what can be said about a minimal counterexample to the conjecture that if $kG$ is noetherian then $G$ is polycyclic-by-finite.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix a prime $p$ and a cuspidal newform $f$ of level coprime to $p$ with $a_p=0$. Attached to $f$ are signed $p$-adic $L$-functions $L_p^\pm(f)$ and Mazur-Tate elements $\theta_n(f)$, both of which encode arithmetic data about $f$ along the cyclotomic $\mathbf{Z}_p$-extension of $\mathbf{Q}$. We compute the Iwasawa invariants of Mazur-Tate elements in terms of the corresponding invariants of the signed $p$-adic $L$-functions. As corollaries, we determine the $p$-adic valuation of critical values of the $L$-function of $f$, and describe a relation between the Iwasawa invariants of congruent modular forms of weights 2 and $p+1$. Our results provide an asymptotic method for computing the signed Iwasawa invariants attached to newforms of any weight $k\geq 2$ with $a_p=0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let \(K\) be a perfectoid field. We describe all quotient fields of the perfectoid Tate algebra \begin{equation*}T_{n, K}^{\text{perfd}}=K\langle X_{1}^{1/p^{\infty}},\dots, X_{n}^{1/p^{\infty}}\rangle \end{equation*}in any number $n\geq1$ of variables in terms of (completed perfections of) the nonarchimedean fields $K_{r_1,\dots, r_l}$ occuring in Berkovich geometry. We prove that every quotient field \begin{equation*}L=T_{n, K}^{\text{perfd}}/\mathfrak{m}\end{equation*}is a so-called semi-immediate extension of $K_{r_1,\dots, r_l}^{\text{perfd}}$ for some \begin{equation*} l \leq \max(0, n-\text{ht}(\mathfrak{m}^{\flat} \cap (T_{n, K^{\flat}})^{\text{coperf}})-1), \end{equation*}which pins down the value groups and the residue fields of the possible quotient fields $L$. The main ingredient in our proof is a qualitative generalization of Berkovich's classification of points on the nonarchimedean closed unit ball. Namely, we introduce the notion of topologically simple valuations, which generalize type (IV) points in the classification of points on $\text{Spa}(K\langle T\rangle)$. We also consider Abhyankar valuations (i.e., those for which Abhyankar's inequality is an equality), which generalize type (II) and (III) points. We prove that, on an affinoid algebra in the sense of Tate which is not a field, the topologically simple valuations are never Abhyankar, and we derive our result on the perfectoid Tate algebra from this statement. Along the way, we also show that our topologically simple valuations are the same as Pr\"ufer-Manis valuations in the sense of \cite{Knebusch-Zhang}. Finally, we also show that all allowed possibilities for the quotient fields $L$ do indeed occur (i.e., the above bound on $l$ is optimal) by generalizing an example of Gleason in \cite{Gleason22N}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Ruzsa's inequality states that $|A+A+A| \leq |A+A|^{3/2}$ for any finite set $A$ in a commutative group. Ruzsa has constructed examples showing that this inequality is sharp asymptotically, up to a constant factor. We prove an inverse result which says that if $|A+A+A| \geq \frac{1}{M} |A+A|^{3/2}$ for some parameter $M,$ then the set $A$ resembles the sets in Ruzsa's construction. We then construct more families of examples which suggest that our inverse result is likely best possible qualitatively. The method extends to give an inverse result for a higher sumset analogue of Ruzsa's inequality, namely $|(h+1)A| \leq |hA|^{\frac{h+1}{h}}$ for any $h\geq 2.$ We also provide a "99%-stability" version of Ruzsa's inequality, which describes near optimal structures when $M$ is very close to $1.$</p></details>

> **Comment:** Adv. Math. to appear, former title: Fractal counterparts of density combinatorics theorems in continued fractions

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We build a bridge from density combinatorics to dimension theory of continued fractions. We establish a fractal transference principle that transfers common properties of subsets of $\mathbb N$ with positive upper density to properties of subsets of irrationals in $(0,1)$ for which the set $\{a_n(x)\colon n\in\mathbb N\}$ of partial quotients induces an injection $n\in\mathbb N\mapsto a_n(x)\in\mathbb N$. Let $(*)$ be a certain property that holds for any subset of $\mathbb N$ with positive upper density. The principle asserts that for any subset $S$ of $\mathbb N$ with positive upper density, there exists a set $E_S$ of Hausdorff dimension $1/2$ such that the set $\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb N}\bigcap_{x\in E_S}\{a_n(x)\}\cap S$ has the same upper density as that of $S$, and thus inherits property $(*)$. Examples of $(*)$ include the existence of arithmetic progressions of arbitrary lengths and the existence of arbitrary polynomial progressions, known as Szemer\'edi's and Bergelson-Leibman's theorems respectively. In the same spirit, we establish a relativized version of the principle applicable to the primes, to the primes of the form $y^2+z^2+1$, to the sets given by the Piatetski-Shapiro sequences.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A calculation was performed to verify Proth-Gilbraith's conjecture for all prime numbers up to 0$^{14}$. The previous calculation was performed by Andrew Odlyzko in 1993 up to 0$^{13}$. This involves calculating the differences between consecutive primes in absolute value and starting over. The conjecture states that all lines except the first begin with 1. To prove it, it suffices to find a line beginning with 1 and followed only by 0 and 2.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The MVW involution -- named after Colette Moeglin, Marie-France Vign\'eras, and Jean-Loup Waldspurger -- is a fundamental dualizing involution in the representation theory of $p$-adic classical groups. It extends the well-known transpose-inverse automorphism for general linear groups. In this work, we establish the existence of the MVW involution for the metaplectic group over a non-archimedean local field $F$ of characteristic different from $2$ and with residue characteristic $p$. Our construction applies to representations over any coefficient field of characteristic distinct from $p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We survey recent work done on the values at integer points of irrational inhomogeneous quadratic forms, namely, inhomogeneous analogues of the famous Oppenheim conjecture. We also prove that the set of such forms in two variables whose set of values at integer points avoids a given countable set not containing zero, has full Hausdorff dimension. Moreover, we consider the more refined variant of this problem, where the shift is fixed and the form is allowed to vary. The strategy is to translate the problems to homogeneous dynamics and deduce the theorems from their dynamical counterparts. While our approach is inspired by the work of Kleinbock and Weiss, the dynamical results can be deduced from more general results of An, Guan, and Kleinbock.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Any $\mathbb{N}$-graded commutative Gorenstein ring $R$ of Krull dimension one with $R_0$ a field admits a standard silting object $V$ in the stable category $\underline{\mathrm{CM}}_0^{\mathbb{Z}}R$, and the object $V$ is tilting if and only if the $a$-invariant $a$ is non-negative, as shown by Buchweitz, the first author, and Yamaura. In this article, under the additional assumption that $R$ is a hypersurface singularity, we prove that endomorphism algebra of $V$ is Iwanaga-Gorenstein of self-injective dimension at most $2$, and we give its explicit presentation in terms of a quiver with relation. In the case of where $a$ is negative, we prove that the dg endomorphism algebra of $V$ is Gorenstein, and we give its explicit presentation in terms of a dg path algebra. We explain our results by several examples including numerical semigroup algebras generated by two elements. Moreover, for each finite and countable Cohen-Macaulay representation type, we include the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the category $\mathrm{CM}_0^{\mathbb{Z}}R$ with the position of the standard silting object. As a step of the proof of our results, we give a characterization of Gorensteinness of homologically finite dg algebras in terms of Serre functors.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathscr{P}$ be a poset and $\mathcal{S}$ a sequence of $n$ finite substes of $\mathscr{P}$. The Jordan type of a $\mathscr{P}$-persistence module $M$ at $\mathcal{S}$, denoted by $\mathsf{J}_{\mathcal{S}}(M) \in \mathbb{N}^n$, is defined as the Jordan type of a nilpotent operator $\mathbf{T}_{M, \mathcal{S}}$, which is constructed from $M$ and $\mathcal{S}$. When $n=2$, we recover the notion of multirank previously introduced and studied in [Tho19]. We first prove that the multirank invariants are complete for persistence modules over finite zigzag posets. This proves a conjecture of Thomas in the zigzag case. The nilpotent operator $\mathbf{T}_{M, \mathcal{S}}$ is functorial in $M$. When $\mathscr{P}=\mathbb{Z}^d$ or $\mathbb{R}^d$, this functoriality allows us to define the Jordan filtered rank invariant of $M$ at $\mathscr{S}$. We demonstrate that these invariants are strictly finer than the classical rank invariants. We next prove that for any two $\mathscr{P}$-persistence modules $M$ and $N$, the landscape and erosion distances between their Jordan filtered rank invariants are bounded from above by the interleaving distance between $M$ and $N$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the rank-4 case of the conjecture of Ha-Hai-Nghia for the invariant subspace of the truncated polynomial ring $\mathcal{Q}_m(n)=\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dots,x_n]/(x_1^{q^m},\dots,x_n^{q^m}),$ under a new, explicit technical hypothesis. Our argument extends the determinant calculus for the delta operator by deriving crucial rank-4 identities governing its interaction with the Dickson algebra. We show that the proof of the conjecture reduces to a specific vanishing property, for which we introduce a sufficient condition, the "matching hypothesis" ($\mathrm{H_{match}}$), relating the degree structures of Dickson invariants. This condition is justified by theoretical arguments and verified computationally in many cases. Combining this approach with the normalized derivation approach from our prior work, we establish the conjecture. As a result, the Lewis-Reiner-Stanton Conjecture is also confirmed for rank four under the given hypothesis.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Web graphs form a family of planar directed graphs with boundary that can be used to model quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_n$-invariant vectors. Standard Young tableaux on an $n \times k$ rectangle naturally index a basis for $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ web graphs. We prove that evacuation of the tableau $T$ corresponds to reflection of the associated web graph $w_T$ up to equivalence under a specific set of edge-flip relations. This extends a result of Patrias and Pechenik for the cases $n=2,3$ and mirrors analogous results about rotation of web graphs corresponding to promotion of tableau by Peterson-Pylyavskyy-Rhoades for $n=3$ and Gaetz-Pechenik-Pfannerer-Striker-Swanson for $n=4$. We use an intermediate object called a multicolored noncrossing matching, which is closely related to the notion of strandings recently introduced by Russell and the fourth author.</p></details>

In each case, we find quadratic invariants which imply quadratic reciprocity obstructions to the conjecture in certain packings. We utilize an explicit parametrization of circles tangent to a fixed circle in each packing type, and a quadratic reciprocity argument. Even in the packings where we do not find quadratic obstructions, the curvatures exhibit a predictable reciprocity structure. This leads to partial obstructions on integers appearing as curvatures in subsets of the packing.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider cohomological stable envelopes for a natural torus action $\mathsf{T}$ on $X=T^*Gr(k,n)$, introduced by Maulik-Okounkov. We define the $\mathbb{C}^*_\hbar$-equivariant integral of the stable envelope using equivariant localization over the subtorus $\mathbb{C}^*_\hbar\subset\mathsf{T}$, and compute the integral as a non-equivariant limit of the localization over the full torus, $\mathsf{T}$. The integral of such a class is an integer times a power of $\hbar$, and the main result of this paper is a combinatorial formula for these integers. In 3d mirror symmetry, these non-equivariant limits are expected to reflect some curve counting phenomena on the 3d mirror dual, $X^\vee$. When $k=1$, we obtain the binomial coefficients, and we study some of the combinatorics of the integers for higher $k$, which haven't appeared in the literature before.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A quantum graph $\mathcal{G}$ housed by a matrix algebra $M_n$ can be encoded as an operator system $\mathcal S=\mathcal{S}_{\mathcal{G}}\le M_n$. There are two sensible notions of quantum automorphism group for any such: $\mathrm{Qut}(\mathcal G)$, capturing the quantum symmetries of the adjacency matrix $A:M_n\to M_n$ attached to $\mathcal{G}$, and $\mathrm{Qut}(\mathcal S\le M_n)$, the quantum group acting universally on $M_n$ so as to preserve its $C^*$ structure, standard trace, and subspace $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$. The two quantum groups coincide classically, but diverge in general. We nevertheless show that both are generically trivial in the sense that they are so for $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$ ranging over a non-empty Zariski-open set under all reasonable dimensional constraints on $\dim \mathcal{S}$ and $n$. This extends analogous prior results by the first and third authors to the effect that classical groups of still-quantum graphs are generically trivial, and offers a fully quantum counterpart to the familiar probabilistic almost-rigidity of finite graphs. An intermediate result sheds some light on the relationship between the two notions of quantum automorphism group, identifying the universal preserver of the quantum adjacency matrix of $\mathcal{G}$ with the quantum automorphism group not of $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$, but rather of the transpose $\mathcal{S}^t\le M_n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a closed $n$-manifold, we consider the set of simple homotopy types of $n$-manifolds within its homotopy type, called its simple homotopy manifold set. We characterise it in terms of algebraic K-theory, the surgery obstruction map, and the homotopy automorphisms of the manifold. We use this to construct the first examples, for all $n \ge 4$ even, of closed $n$-manifolds that are homotopy equivalent but not simple homotopy equivalent. In fact, we construct infinite families of manifolds that are all homotopy equivalent but pairwise not simple homotopy equivalent, and our examples can be taken to be smooth for $n \geq 6$. Our examples are homotopy equivalent to the product of a circle and a lens space. We analyse the simple homotopy manifold sets of these manifolds, determining exactly when they are trivial, finite, or infinite, and investigating their asymptotic behaviour. The proofs involve integral representation theory and class numbers of cyclotomic fields. We also compare with the relation of $h$-cobordism, and produce similar detailed quantitative descriptions of the manifold sets that arise.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v4: major and final revision, to appear in G&T. v3: 43 pages, material re-arranged, genus one reduction of connectedness and relation to skein theory clarified

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Modular functors are traditionally defined as systems of projective representations of mapping class groups of surfaces that are compatible with gluing. They can formally be described as modular algebras over central extensions of the modular surface operad, with the values of the algebra lying in a suitable symmetric monoidal $(2,1)$-category $\mathcal{S}$ of linear categories. In this paper, we prove that modular functors in $\mathcal{S}$ are equivalent to self-dual balanced braided algebras $\mathcal{A}$ in $\mathcal{S}$ (a categorification of the notion of a commutative Frobenius algebra) for which a condition formulated in terms of factorization homology with coefficients in $\mathcal{A}$ is satisfied; we call such $\mathcal{A}$ connected. The equivalence in one direction is afforded by genus zero restriction. Our construction of the inverse equivalence is entirely topological and can be thought of as a far reaching generalization of the construction of modular functors from skein theory. In order to verify the connectedness condition in practice, we prove that it can be reduced to a single condition in genus one. Moreover, we show that cofactorizability of $\mathcal{A}$, a condition known to be satisfied for modular categories, is sufficient. Therefore, we recover in particular Lyubashenko's construction of a modular functor from a (not necessarily semisimple) modular category and show that it is determined by its genus zero part. Additionally, we exhibit modular functors that do not come from modular categories and outline applications to the theory of vertex operator algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A filtration of the morphisms of the $k$-linearization $k \mathbf{FS}$ of the category $\mathbf{FS}$ of finite sets and surjections is constructed using a natural $k \mathbf{FI}^{op}$-module structure induced by restriction, where $\mathbf{FI}$ is the category of finite sets and injections. In particular, this yields the `primitive' subcategory $ k \mathbf{FS}^0 \subset k \mathbf{FS}$ that is of independent interest; for example, the category of $k \mathbf{FS}^0$-modules is closely related to the category of $k \mathbf{FA}$-modules, where $\mathbf{FA}$ is the category of finite sets and all maps. Working over a field of characteristic zero, the subquotients of this filtration are identified as bimodules over $k \mathbf{FB}$, where $\mathbf{FB}$ is the category of finite sets and bijections, also exhibiting and exploiting additional structure. In particular, this describes the underlying $k \mathbf{FB}$-bimodule of $k \mathbf{FS}^0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $x\geqslant 3$, for $1\leqslant n \leqslant x$ an integer, let $\omega(n)$ be its number of distinct prime factors. We show that, among the values $n\leqslant x$ with $\omega(n)=k$ where $1\leqslant k \ll \log_2 x$, $\omega(n-1)$ satisfies an Erd\H{o}s-Kac type theorem around $2\log_2 x$, so in large deviation regime, when weighted by $2^{\omega(n-1)}$. This sharpens a result of Gorodetsky and Grimmelt with a quantitative and quasi-optimal error term. The proof of the main theorem is based on the characteristic function method and uses recent progress on Titchmarsh's divisor problem.</p></details>

We prove that this bi-$\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-structure decomposes into the direct sum of $1$-dimensional bi-$\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-subspaces, and make this decomposition explicit for the moduli space of abelian varieties $\mathbb{A}_g$. We propose an Analytic Subspace Conjecture, which is the analogue of the W\"{u}stholz's Analytic Subgroup Theorem in this context. We show that this conjecture, applied to $\mathbb{A}_g$, implies that all quadratic $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-relations among the holomorphic periods of CM abelian varieties arise from elementary ones.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We extend Friedman's theorem to show that, for any fixed $r>1$, a random $2r$--regular Schreier graph associated with the action of $r$ uniformly random permutations of $[n]$ on $k_{n}$--tuples of distinct elements in $[n]$ has a near--optimal spectral gap with high probability, provided $k_{n}\leq n^{\frac{1}{20}-\epsilon}.$ Previously this was known only for $k$--tuples where $k$ is fixed. In fact, we prove the stronger result of strong convergence of random permutations in irreducible representations of quasi--exponential dimension. Along the way, we give a new bound for the expected stable irreducible character of a random permutation obtained via a word map, showing that $\mathbb{E}\left[\chi^{\mu}\left(w(\sigma_{1},\dots,\sigma_{r})\right)\right]=O\left(\frac{1}{\dim\chi^{\mu}}\right)=O\left(n^{-k}\right)$, where $k$ is the number of boxes outside the first row of the Young diagram $\mu,$ solving one aspect of a conjecture of Hanany and Puder. We obtain this bound using an extension of Wise's $w$--cycle conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Many modern learning tasks require models that can take inputs of varying sizes. Consequently, dimension-independent architectures have been proposed for domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design principles for designing new transferable models. Numerical experiments support our findings.</p></details>

Recent work by Merca et al. proposes generalizations of perfect-power repulsion for $p(n)$. In this note, we prove these generalizations for the functions $p_B(n)$, which count the number of partitions of $n$ with the largest part $\leq B$. If $B\geq 4$ and $k\geq 3$, with $k\nmid (B-1)$, then we prove that there are only finitely many pairs $(n,m)$ for which $$\lvert p_B(n)-m^k\rvert\le d.$$ These results support Sun and Merca et al.'s conjectures, as $p_B(n) \rightarrow p(n)$ when $B \rightarrow +\infty.$ To prove this, we reduce the problem to Siegel's Theorem, which guarantees the finiteness of integral points on curves with genus $\geq 1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Kleshchev and Livesey proved the existence of RoCK $p$-blocks for double covers of symmetric and alternating groups over large enough coefficient rings. They proved that these RoCK blocks of double covers are Morita equivalent to standard ``local" blocks via bimodules with endopermutation source. Based on this, Kleshchev and Livesey proved that RoCK blocks are splendidly Rickard equivalent to their Brauer correspondents. The analogous result for blocks of symmetric groups, a theorem of Chuang and Kessar, was an important step in Chuang and Rouquier ultimately proving Brou\'e's abelian defect group conjecture for symmetric groups. In this paper we show that the Morita and splendid Rickard equivalences constructed by Kleshchev and Livesey descend to the ring $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p$-adic integers, hence prove Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'e's abelian defect group conjecture for these RoCK blocks.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Every word $w$ in $F_r$, the free group of rank $r$, induces a probability measure (the $w$-measure) on every finite group $G$, by substitution of random $G$-elements in the letters. This measure is determined by its Fourier coefficients: the $w$-expectations $E_w[\chi]$ of the irreducible characters of $G$. For every finite group $G$, every stable character $\chi$ of $G\wr S_n$ (trace of a finitely generated $FI_G$-module), and every word $w\in F_r$, we approximate $E_w[\chi]$ up to an error term of $O(n^{-\pi(w)})$, where $\pi(w)$ is the primitivity rank of $w$. This generalizes previous works by Puder, Hanany, Magee and the author. As an application we show that random Schreier graphs of representation-stable actions of $G\wr S_n$ are close-to-optimal expanders. The paper reveals a surprising relation between stable representation theory of wreath products and not-necessarily connected Stallings core graphs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We first give a geometric construction of a 2-dimensional mixed motive over $\mathbb{Q}$ with the Catalan constant $\mathbf{G}=1-1/3^2+1/5^2-1/7^2+\cdots$ as a period. We then use this motive to obtain a supply of linear forms in 1 and $\mathbf{G}$. We also explicitly compute the coefficients of 1 and $\mathbf{G}$ in these linear forms.</p></details>
