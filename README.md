 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Bernd C. Kellner &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 17 pages, 4 tables

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Extending previous work of the author, we compute the Wilson quotient modulo $p^5$ and $p^6$, and equivalently $(p-1)!$ modulo $p^6$ and $p^7$, respectively. Further, we determine some power sums of the Fermat quotients up to modulo $p^6$. Subsequently, we discuss some patterns that occur in the $p$-adic coefficients of the Wilson quotient as well as of $(p-1)!$, whereby the original congruence $(p-1)! \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$ fits perfectly into the theory.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Bernd C. Kellner &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 16 pages, 1 table, 1 figure, revised

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By recent work of the author, Wilson's theorem as well as the Wilson quotient can be described by supercongruences of power sums of Fermat quotients modulo every higher prime power. We translate these congruences into congruences of power sums and Bernoulli numbers. This together provides relatively short proofs of the congruences compared to former approaches. As an application, we compute, e.g., the Wilson quotient up to modulo $p^4$ and equivalently the factorial $(p-1)!$ up to modulo $p^5$, which can be extended to any higher prime power with some effort. As a by-product, we determine some power sums of the Fermat quotients up to modulo $p^4$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kimball Martin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 31 pages, 12 figures; this version corrects minor mathematical misprints in the published version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, we showed that global root numbers of modular forms are biased toward +1. Together with Pharis, we also showed an initial bias of Fourier coefficients towards the sign of the root number. First, we prove analogous results with respect to local root numbers. Second, a subtle correlation between Fourier coefficients and global root numbers, termed murmurations, was recently discovered for elliptic curves and modular forms. We conjecture murmurations in a more general context of different (possibly empty) combinations of local root numbers. Last, an appendix corrects a sign error in our joint paper with Pharis.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 16 pages; this version corrects a mathematical misprint in the published version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Previously we observed that newforms obey a strict bias towards root number $+1$ in squarefree levels: at least half of the newforms in $S_k(\Gamma_0(N))$ with root number $+1$ for $N$ squarefree, and it is strictly more than half outside of a few special cases. Subsequently, other authors treated levels which are cubes of squarefree numbers. Here we treat arbitrary levels, and find that if the level is not the square of a squarefree number, this strict bias still holds for any weight. In fact the number of such exceptional levels is finite for fixed weight, and 0 if $k < 12$. We also investigate some variants of this question to better understand the exceptional levels.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A recent result of Rickards states that the generating series of intersection numbers of real quadratic geodesics on indefinite Shimura curves are elliptic modular forms. We reinterpret this as a Kudla-Millson theta series, and prove that Rickards' generating series is the diagonal restriction of a Hilbert modular form, analogous to results of Darmon-Pozzi-Vonk and Branchereau.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Several minor corrections and improved exposition, comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $X$ a smooth proper $K$-variety with good reduction. Under a mild assumption on the behaviour of Hodge numbers under reduction modulo $p$, we prove that the existence of a non-zero global 2-form on $X$ implies, after a finite extension of $K$, the existence of $p$-torsion Brauer classes with surjective evaluation map. This implies that any smooth proper variety over a number field which satisfies weak approximation over all finite extensions has no non-zero global 2-form. The proof is based on a prismatic interpretation of Brauer classes with eventually constant evaluation, and a Newton-above-Hodge result for the mod $p$ reduction of prismatic cohomology. This generalises work of Bright and the second-named author beyond the ordinary reduction case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an explicit asymptotic formula for the logarithm of the minimal ranks of $n$-universal lattices over the ring of integers of totally real number fields. We also show that, for any constant $C > 0$ and $n \geq 3$, there are only finitely many totally real fields with an $n$-universal lattice of rank at most $C$, with all such fields being effectively computable. Similarly, for any $n \geq 3$, we show that there are only finitely many totally real fields admitting an $n$-universal criterion set of size at most $C$, with all such fields likewise being effectively computable.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a generalization to Jennrich's uniqueness theorem for tensor decompositions in the undercomplete setting. Our uniqueness theorem is based on an alternative definition of the standard tensor decomposition, which we call matrix-vector decomposition. Moreover, in the same settings in which our uniqueness theorem applies, we also design and analyze an efficient randomized algorithm to compute the unique minimum matrix-vector decomposition (and thus a tensor rank decomposition of minimum rank). As an application of our uniqueness theorem and our efficient algorithm, we show how to compute all matrices of minimum rank (up to scalar multiples) in certain generic vector spaces of matrices.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: 40 pages, final version to appear on Adv. Theor. Math. Phys

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We combine the theory of Cartan-Tanaka prolongations with the Molien-Weyl integral formula and Hilbert-Poincar\'e series to compute the Spencer cohomology groups of the $D=11$ Poincar\'e superalgebra $\mathfrak p$, relevant for superspace formulations of $11$-dimensional supergravity in terms of nonholonomic superstructures. This includes novel fermionic Spencer groups, providing with new cohomology classes of $\mathbb Z$-grading $1$ and form number $2$. Using the Hilbert-Poincar\'e series and the Euler characteristic, we also explore Spencer cohomology contributions in higher form numbers. We then propose a new general definition of filtered deformations of graded Lie superalgebras along first-order fermionic directions and investigate such deformations of $\mathfrak p$ that are maximally supersymmetric. In particular, we establish a no-go type theorem for maximally supersymmetric filtered subdeformations of $\mathfrak p$ along timelike (i.e., generic) first-order fermionic directions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Thanasis Bouganis, Rafail Psyroukis &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 27 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a Dirichlet series $D_{F,G}(s)$ attached to two modular forms $F$ and $G$ of an orthogonal group of real signature $(2,4)$, involving their Fourier--Jacobi coefficients. When $F$ is a Hecke eigenform and $G$ a Poincar\'e series, our main result gives that $D_{F,G}(s)$ is equal to the standard $L$-function attached to $F$, up to an explicit constant. To establish this, we use a correspondence between binary Hermitian forms and ideals of quaternion algebras, as established by Latimer, together with the fact that the even Clifford algebra of a three-dimensional definite quadratic space can be identified with a quaternion division algebra. Our work should be seen as a generalisation of a work of Kohnen and Skoruppa, whose result corresponds to the case of the orthogonal group of real signature $(2,3)$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Daewoong Cheong, Gennian Ge, Doowon Koh, Thang Pham, Dung The Tran, Tao Zhang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 29 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a set $E \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$, the distance set is defined as $\Delta(E) := \{\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\| : \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in E\}$, where $\|\cdot\|$ denotes the standard quadratic form. We investigate the Erd\H{o}s--Falconer distance problem within the flexible class of $(u, s)$--Salem sets introduced by Fraser, with emphasis on the even case $u = 4$. By exploiting the exact identity between $\|\widehat{E}\|_4$ and the fourth additive energy $\Lambda_4(E)$, we prove that quantitative gains in $\Lambda_4(E)$ force the existence of many distances. In particular, for a $(4, s)$--Salem set $E\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ with $d \geq 2$, we prove that if $$ |E|\gg q^{\min\left\{\frac{d+2}{4s+1}, \frac{d+4}{8s}\right\}}, $$ then $E$ determines a positive proportion of all distances. This strictly improves Fraser's threshold of $\frac{d}{4s}$ and the Iosevich-Rudnev bound of $q^{\frac{d+1}{2}}$ in certain parameter ranges. As applications, we obtain improved thresholds for multiplicative subgroups and sets on arbitrary varieties, and establish a sharp incidence bound for Salem sets that is of independent interest in incidence geometry. We also propose a unified conjecture for $(4, s)$--Salem sets that reconciles known bounds and pinpoints the odd-dimensional sphere regime: in odd dimensions $d \geq 3$, the often-cited $\frac{d-1}{2}$ threshold does not follow without additional structure, while on primitive-radius spheres, any $q^{-\epsilon/2}$-gain in the fourth energy improves the standing threshold of $\frac{d}{2}$. This provides a new approach to address this problem.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Philip Schlösser &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Intermediate Macdonald polynomials for an affine root system $S$ with fixed origin and finite Weyl group $W_0$ are orthogonal polynomials invariant under a parabolic subgroup $W_J\le W_0$. The extreme cases of $W_J=1$ and $W_J=W_0$ correspond to the non-symmetric and symmetric Macdonald polynomials, respectively. In this paper we use double-affine Hecke algebras to study their basic properties, including that they form an orthogonal basis and that they diagonalise a commutative algebra of difference-reflection operators, and calculate their norms. Finally, we provide two interpretations of intermediate Macdonald polynomials as vector-valued polynomials of which examples can be found in the literature.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a real group $G$, it is known from the work of Kostant and Vogan that the L-packet associated with an L-parameter $\varphi$ of $G$ contains a \emph{generic} representation if and only if the ${}^{\vee}G$-orbit in the variety of geometric parameters corresponding to $\varphi$ is open. In these notes, we generalize this result slightly by proving that the same equivalence holds when the L-packet of $\varphi$ is replaced by the micro-packet attached to $\varphi$ by Adams-Barbasch-Vogan. As a corollary, we deduce the Enhanced Shahidi Conjecture for real groups: the Arthur packet attached to an A-parameter $\psi$ of $G$ contains a generic representation if and only if $\psi|_{\mathrm{SL}_2}$ is trivial.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 27 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we extend Howard's construction of compatible families of Heegner points to the setting of towers of Gross curves and Shimura curves over totally real fields. Following the strategy of Longo and Vigni, our approach simultaneously treats totally definite and indefinite quaternion algebras. We then extend their interpolation methods to define big Heegner points attached to families of Hilbert modular forms of parallel weight under the weak Heegner hypothesis. Applying this construction, we build in the definite setting a totally real analogue of Longo$-$Vigni's two-variable $p$-adic $L$-function, and in the indefinite setting, a system of big Heegner classes in the sense of Howard.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: Minor changes to the overall structure of the paper

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study two classes of $\ell$-modular standard modules of the general linear group. The first class is obtained by reducing existing standard modules over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$ to $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell$ with respect to their natural integral structure. The second class is obtained by studying the generic extension map of the cyclical quiver, which was motivated by the construction of certain monomial bases of quantum algebras. In the later case we also manage to prove a modular version of the Langlands classification, similar to the work of Langlands and Zelevinsky over $\mathbb{C}$. We moreover compute the $\ell$-modular Rankin-Selberg $L$-function of both classes and check that they agree with the $L$-functions of their $\mathrm{C}$-parameters constructed by Kurinczuk and Matringe.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the alternating sum of the floor function of $\sqrt{jn}$, with $j$ ranging from 1 to $n$, has an easy evaluation for all odd integers $n\geq 1$. This is in contrast to known non-alternating sums of the same type which hold only for a class of primes. The proof is elementary and was suggested by an AI model. To put this result in perspective, we also prove an asymptotic expression for the analogous sum without the floor function.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 48 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop techniques at the interface between differential algebra and model theory to study the following problems of exponential algebraicity: Does a given algebraic differential equation admits an exponentially algebraic solution, that is, a holomorphic solution which is definable in the structure of restricted elementary functions? Do solutions of a given list of algebraic differential equations share a nontrivial exponentially algebraic relation, that is, a nontrivial relation definable in the structure of restricted elementary functions? These problems can be traced back to the work of Abel and Liouville on the problem of integration in finite terms. This article concerns generalizations of their techniques adapted to the study of exponential transcendence and independence problems for more general systems of differential equations. As concrete applications, we obtain exponential transcendence and independence statements for several classical functions: the error function, the Bessel functions, indefinite integrals of algebraic expressions involving Lambert's W-function, the equation of the pendulum, as well as corresponding decidability results.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce formulas for the logarithms of Drinfeld modules using a framework recently developed by the second author. We write the logarithm function as the evaluation under a motivic map of a product of rigid analytic trivializations of $t$-motives. We then specialize our formulas to express special values of Goss $L$-functions as Drinfeld periods multiplied by rigid analytic trivializations evaluated under this motivic map. We view these formulas as characteristic-$p$ analogues of integral representations of Hasse-Weil type zeta functions. We also apply this machinery for Drinfeld modules tensored with the tensor powers of the Carlitz module, which serves as the Tate twist of a Drinfeld module.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A $d$-silting object is a silting object whose derived endomorphism algebra has global dimension $d$ or less. We give an equivalent condition, which can be stated in terms of dg quivers, for silting mutations to preserve the $d$-siltingness under a mild assumption. Moreover, we show that this mild assumption is always satisfied by $\nu_d$-finite algebras. As an application, we give a counterexample to the open question by Herschend-Iyama-Oppermann: the quivers of higher hereditary algebras are acyclic. Our example is a $2$-representation tame algebra with a $2$-cycle which is derived equivalent to a toric Fano stacky surface.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The importance of studying $d$-tilting bundles, which are tilting bundles whose endomorphism algebras have global dimension $d$ (or less), on $d$-dimensional smooth projective varieties has been recognized recently. In Chan's paper, it is conjectured that a smooth projective surface has a $2$-tilting bundle if and only if it is weak del Pezzo. In this paper, we prove this conjecture. Moreover, we show that this endomorphism algebra becomes a $2$-representation infinite algebra whose 3-Calabi-Yau completion gives a non-commutative crepant resolution (NCCR) of the corresponding Du Val del Pezzo cone.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For fixed positive integers $n,m$, let $\mathrm{Mat}_{n\times m}(\mathbb{C})$ be the affine space consisting of all $n\times m$ complex matrices, and let $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n\times m}]$ be its coordinate ring. For $0\le r\le\min\{m,n\}$, we apply the orbit harmonics method to the finite matrix loci $\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r}$ of rook placements with exactly $r$ rooks, yielding a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n\times\mathfrak{S}_m$-module $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We find one signed and two sign-free graded character formulae for $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We also exhibit some applications of these formulae, such as proving a concise presentation of $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$, and proving some module injections and isomorphisms. Some of our techniques are still valid for involution matrix loci.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Under certain assumptions, we show that unitary rational $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ conformal field theories together with a certain generating set of Cardy boundary states in the associated boundary conformal field theories give rise to rational Hodge structures of complex multiplication type. We argue that these rational Hodge structures for such rational conformal field theories arising from infrared fixed points of $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ non-linear sigma models with Calabi-Yau target spaces coincide with the rational Hodge structures of the middle-dimensional cohomology of the target space geometry. This gives non-trivial evidence of the general expectation in the literature that rational $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric conformal field theories associated to Calabi-Yau target spaces yield middle dimensional cohomological rational Hodge structures with complex multiplication. We exemplify our general results with the $\mathcal{N}=2$ A-type minimal model series - which do not have a geometric origin as a non-linear sigma model - and with two explicit $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ Gepner models that correspond to particular non-linear sigma models with specific Calabi-Yau threefold target spaces.</p></details>

We give growth rules, based on a novel crystal-theoretic technique, for generating our basis webs from tableaux and we use skein relations to give an algorithm for expressing arbitrary webs in the basis.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f(n)$ be a random completely multiplicative function such that $f(p) = \pm 1$ with probabilities $1/2$ independently at each prime. We study the conditional probability, given that $f(p) = 1$ for all $p < y$, that all partial sums of $f(n)$ up to $x$ are nonnegative. We prove that for $y \ge C \frac{(\log x)^2 \log_2 x}{\log_3 x}$ this probability equals $1 - o(1)$. We also study the probability $P_x'$ that $\sum_{n \le x} \frac{f(n)}{n}$ is negative. We prove that $P_x' \ll \exp \left( - \exp \left( \frac{\log x \log_4 x}{(1 + o(1)) \log_3 x)} \right) \right)$, which improves a bound given by Kerr and Klurman. Under a conjecture closely related to Hal\'asz's theorem, we prove that $P_x' \ll \exp(-x^{\alpha})$ for some $\alpha > 0$. Let $\chi_p(n) = \left( \frac{n}{p} \right)$ be the Legendre symbol modulo $p$. For a prime $p$ chosen uniformly at random from $(x, 2x]$, we express the probability that all partial sums of $\frac{\chi_p(n)}{n}$ are nonnegative in terms of the same probability for a random completely multiplicative function $f$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we develop a new geometric approach to subtractive continued fraction algorithms in high dimensions. We adapt a version of Farey summation to the geometric techniques proposed by F. Klein in 1895. More specifically we introduce Farey polyhedra and their sails that generalise respectively Klein polyhedra and their sails, and show similar duality properties of the Farey sail integer invariants. The construction of Farey sails is based on the multidimensional generalisation of the Farey tessellation provided by a modification of the continued fraction algorithm introduced by R. W. J. Meester. We classify Farey polyhedra in the combinatorial terms of prismatic diagrams. Prismatic diagrams extend boat polygons introduced by S. Morier-Genoud and V. Ovsienko in the two-dimensional case. As one of the applications of the new theory we get a multidimensional version of Conway-Coxeter frieze patterns. We show that multidimensional frieze patterns satisfy generalised Ptolemy relations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the rank-4 case of the conjecture of Ha-Hai-Nghia for the invariant subspace of the truncated polynomial ring $\mathcal{Q}_m(n)=\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dots,x_n]/(x_1^{q^m},\dots,x_n^{q^m}),$ under a new, explicit technical hypothesis. Our argument extends the determinant calculus for the delta operator by deriving crucial rank-4 identities governing its interaction with the Dickson algebra. We show that the proof of the conjecture reduces to a specific vanishing property, for which we introduce a sufficient condition, the "matching hypothesis" ($\mathrm{H_{match}}$), relating the degree structures of Dickson invariants. This condition is justified by theoretical arguments and verified computationally in many cases. Combining this approach with the normalized derivation approach from our prior work, we establish the conjecture. As a result, the Lewis-Reiner-Stanton Conjecture is also confirmed for rank four under the given hypothesis.</p></details>

We apply the general framework to obtain the LLN for a large class of Markov chains of $N$ nonintersecting particles with interaction of log-gas type, and the LLN for the multiplication of Jack polynomials, as the inverse temperature tends to zero. We express the answer in terms of novel one-parameter deformations of cumulants and their description provided by us recovers previous work by Bufetov--Gorin on quantized free cumulants when $\theta=1$, and by Benaych-Georges--Cuenca--Gorin after a deformation to continuous space of random matrix eigenvalues. Our methods are robust enough to be applied to the fixed temperature regime, where we recover the LLN of Huang.</p></details>

The results of this paper facilitate the construction of such graphs by providing all closest neighbours for a given node in the graph. More precisely, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for one congruence orbit of a skew-symmetric matrix pencil, A, to belong to the closure of the congruence orbit of another pencil, B, such that there is no pencil, C, whose orbit contains the closure of the orbit of A and is contained in the closure of the orbit of B.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an associative algebra $A$ with a simple module $M$ with trivial endomorphisms and trivial annihilator we verify the countable separation property (CSP), i.e. we prove that there exists a list of nonzero elements $a_1, a_2,\ldots$ of $A$ such that every two-sided ideal of $A$ contains at least one such $a_i$. Based on this result we verify the countable separation property for a free associative algebra with finite or countable set of generators over any field. The countable separation property was studied before in the works of Dixmier and others but only in the context of Noetherian algebras (and a free associative algebra is very far from being Noetherian).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the representation theory of various convolution algebras attached to the $q$-deformation of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ from an algebraic perspective and beyond the unitary case. We show that many aspects of the classical representation theory of real semisimple groups can be transposed to this context. In particular, we prove an analogue of the Harish-Chandra isomorphism and we introduce an analogue of parabolic induction. We use these tools to to classify the (non-unitary) irreducible admissible representations of $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. Moreover, we explicitly show how these irreducible representations converge to the classical admissible dual of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. For that purpose, we define a version of the quantized universal enveloping algebra defined over the ring of analytic functions on $\mathbb{R}_+^*$, which specializes at $q = 1$ to the enveloping $\ast$-algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$ .</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Conjectures of Braverman and Kazhdan, Ng\^o and Sakellaridis have motivated the development of Schwartz spaces for certain spherical varieties. We prove that under suitable assumptions these Schwartz spaces are naturally a representation of a group that we christen the modulation group. This provides a broad generalization of the defining representation of the metaplectic group. The example of a vector space and the zero locus of a quadric cone in an even number of variables are discussed in detail. In both of these cases the modulation group is closely related to algebraic groups, and we propose a conjectural method of linking modulation groups to ind-algebraic groups in general. At the end of the paper we discuss adelization and the relationship between representations of modulation groups and the Poisson summation conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We employ analytic number theoretic techniques, specifically character sums and Weil type estimates, to study the covering radius of the generalized Zetterberg codes over all finite fields. Although the even and odd field cases require distinct technical treatment, the proofs follow a unified analytic framework that is substantially simpler and more transparent than previous approaches. We prove that the covering radius is at most 3 in all cases, and determine its exact value for a wide range of parameters. In even characteristic, our results fill the gap left by recent studies focused solely on odd characteristic; for odd characteristic, the range of parameters for which the covering radius is exactly determined is considerably broader than previously known. Combined with the corresponding minimum distance results, we obtain infinitely many quasi-perfect and maximal codes within this family.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the patching setting, given a factorization inverse system of fields over which patching for finite-dimensional vector spaces holds, together with a crossed module over the inverse limit field, the corresponding six-term Mayer--Vietoris sequence is constructed, generalizing the classical result of Harbater--Hartmann--Krashen for linear algebraic groups. When the crossed module is a two-term complex of tori, the above sequence is extended into a nine-term exact sequence, notably without any assumption on global domination of Galois cohomology of the inverse system. To this end, we develop a theory of (co-)flasque resolutions for short complexes of tori which is built on the work of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Sansuc. As an application, we show that patching holds for nonabelian second Galois cohomology of reductive groups with smooth centers. We then obtain a weak local--global principle for this cohomology set in the simply connected semisimple case. We also rediscover a well-known local--global principle for indices of central simple algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates Srinivasa Ramanujan's initial intuitive methodology for assigning the finite value -1/12 to the sum of the divergent infinite series of all positive integers. We systematically examine Ramanujan's initial method, originally sketched in his notebooks, and set the methodology into an algebraic framework. The methodology has limited applicability to other classes of divergent series. The methodology is extended to assign a Ramanujan smoothed sum to the infinite sequences of integers raised to a positive integer power and to figurate binomial number sequences, including triangular numbers, tetrahedral numbers, and higher-dimensional analogues, avoiding analytical continuation. A key finding establishes that the Ramanujan smoothed sums of figurate binomial sequences are intrinsically connected to logarithmic numbers (Gregory coefficients), providing a novel perspective on Ramanujan summation through the lens of classical combinatorial functions. The paper applies asymptotic expansions of associated rational generating functions to demonstrate consistency with established results from analytic continuation methods. The results illuminate the deeper mathematical structures underlying Ramanujan's intuitive insights and suggest new avenues for research in divergent series summation.</p></details>

Denote the corresponding GIT quotient by $$ \mathcal{X}_{s,n,r} = \mathrm{Spec}\bigl((\mathbb{C}[z_1,\dots,z_n])^G\bigr). $$ Then the varieties $\mathcal{X}_{s,n,r}$ is a cyclic quotient singularity of type $\tfrac{1}{r}\bigl(\underbrace{1,\dots,1}_{s}, \underbrace{-1,\dots,-1}_{n-s}\bigr)$. We show that the associated $G$-Hilbert schemes $\mathcal{Y}_{s,n,r}$ are smooth, connected, and irreducible. The natural morphism $$ \rho_{s,n,r}:\mathcal{Y}_{s,n,r}\longrightarrow\mathcal{X}_{s,n,r} $$ is a projective resolution of $\mathcal{X}_{s,n,r}$, discrepant for $n \ge 3$. We establish that the irreducible components of the central fiber $\rho_{s,n,r}^{-1}(0)$ are in bijection with the nontrivial characters of \(G\), thereby realizing the classical McKay correspondence in this family of examples. Finally, we describe a canonical choice of this bijection via the Fourier--Mukai type functor $$ \Psi : D^b(\mathrm{Coh}_G(\mathbb{C}^n)) \longrightarrow D^b(\mathrm{Coh}(\mathcal{Y}_{s,n,r})), $$ by showing that, for each nontrivial irreducible representation of $G$, the corresponding skyscraper sheaf is mapped to a complex whose $0^{\text{th}}$ cohomology is supported on a unique irreducible component of the central fiber $\rho_{s,n,r}^{-1}(0)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Classical studies of the Fibonacci sequence focus on its periodicity modulo m (the Pisano periods) with canonical initialization. We investigate instead the complete periodic structure arising from all m^2 possible initializations in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. We discover perfect chiral symmetry between the Fibonacci recurrence $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and its parity transform $a_n = -a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$, and observe fractal self-similarity in the extension from prime to prime power moduli. Additionally, we classify prime moduli due to their periodicity, and show that they exhibit weight preservation under modular extension. Furthermore, we define a minima distribution $P(n)$ governed by Lucas ratios, which satisfies the symmetric relation $P(n)=P(1-n)$. For cyclotomic recurrences, we conjecture explicit counting functions for the number of distinct periods, with connections to necklace enumeration. These findings suggest potential links to Viswanath's random recurrence, modular forms and $L$-functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate fibrations by non-hyperelliptic curves of arithmetic genus three and geometric genus one in characteristic two. Assuming that there is only one moving singularity and that its image in the Frobenius pullback of the fibration has degree one over the base, we provide a complete classification up to birational equivalence. This relies on an in-depth analysis of the generic fibres, whose geometry we describe explicitly. We prove that these fibrations are covered by elliptic fibrations, and that the covers are birational on the fibres but purely inseparable of exponent one on the bases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\lambda\colon A\rightarrow A^{\vee}$ be a polarization on an abelian variety over a field $k$. If $k$ is not algebraically closed, there might not exist an ample line bundle on $A$ defined over $k$ that represents $\lambda$. To remedy this, Poonen and Stoll have asked the following question: does there exist a line bundle on an $A$-torsor that represents $\lambda$? We give a criterion for the existence of such a torsor and line bundle which only depends on the kernel of $\lambda$. Using this criterion, we show that the answer to the question is yes when the polarization has odd or small even degree. On the other hand, we show that for every $g\geq 7$, there exists a polarized $g$-dimensional abelian variety for which the answer to the question is no.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 19 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a theory of primitive pairs for $\mathbb{Z}$-graded Lie algebras when the sheaves have coefficients in a field $\Bbbk$ of positive characteristic, providing a graded analogue of the role played by cuspidal pairs in the generalized Springer correspondence. We consider the centralizer $G_0$ of a fixed cocharacter $\chi$ in a connected, reductive, algebraic group $G$ and its action on the eigenspaces $\mathfrak{g}_n$ of $\chi$. Building on the framework of parity sheaves and the Fourier transform established in \cite{Ch,Ch1}, we show that every indecomposable parity sheaf on $\mathfrak{g}_n$ can be expressed as a direct summand of a complex induced from primitive data on a Levi subgroup. This result extends the fact that, in the graded setting, any indecomposable parity sheaf is direct summand of an induced cuspidal datum \cite{Ch}. This confirms the organizing role of primitive pairs in the block decomposition of the category of $G_0$-equivariant parity sheaves on $\mathfrak{g}_n$. We further establish that primitive pairs on the nilpotent cone induce primitive pairs in the graded setting, and we prove that primitivity is preserved under the Fourier--Sato transform. These results reveal a deep compatibility between the geometry of graded Lie algebras and their representation-theoretic structures, forming the foundation for a graded version of the generalized Springer correspondence in positive characteristic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $U$ be a tensor product of highest weight modules of $GL_n(\mathbb C)$ corresponding to multiples of fundamental weights (i.e. rectangles). We consider three ways to stratify $U^{\otimes k}$ into components: using isotypic components of the cyclic action on tensor factors, using a generalization of the charge statistic, and using certain generalizations of Assaf's dual equivalence graphs. We conjecture that all three ways coincide, and we prove that the latter two ways coincide. The Kirillov-Reshetikhin dual equivalence graphs (KR DEGs) we introduce for this purpose are defined on $0$-weight spaces of tensor products of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals. They generalize Kazhdan-Lusztig dual equivalence graphs (KL DEGs) that previously appeared in the study of Kazhdan-Lusztig cells in affine type A. While the tensor products of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals are connected as affine crystals, the KR DEGs in general are not.</p></details>

We also give a combinatorial description of the embedding from the crystal of a $q$-oscillator representation to that of the negative half subalgebra given in terms of a PBW type basis. It is given as a composition of embeddings into the crystals of intermediate parabolic Verma modules, where the most non-trivial one is from an oscillator module to a maximally parabolic Verma module with respect to a quantum subsuperalgebra for $\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n}$. A new crystal theoretic realization of Burge correspondence of orthosymplectic type plays an important role for the description of this embedding.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We make a systematic study of duality phenomena in tensor-triangular geometry, generalising and complementing previous results of Balmer--Dell'Ambrogio--Sanders and Dwyer--Greenlees--Iyengar. A key feature of our approach is the use of proxy-smallness to remove assumptions on functors preserving compact objects, and to this end we introduce proxy-small geometric functors and establish their key properties. Given such a functor, we classify the rigid objects in its associated torsion category, giving a new perspective on results of Benson--Iyengar--Krause--Pevtsova. As a consequence, we show that any proxy-small geometric functor satisfies Grothendieck duality on a canonical subcategory of objects, irrespective of whether its right adjoint preserves compact objects. We use this as a tool to classify Matlis dualising objects and to provide a suitable generalisation of the Gorenstein ring spectra of Dwyer--Greenlees--Iyengar in tensor-triangular geometry. We illustrate the framework developed with various examples and applications, showing that it captures Matlis duality and Gorenstein duality in commutative algebra, duality phenomena in chromatic and equivariant stable homotopy theory, and Watanabe's theorem in polynomial invariant theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a monoidal equivalence, called universal Koszul duality, between genuine equivariant K-motives on a Kac-Moody flag variety and constructible monodromic sheaves on its Langlands dual. The equivalence is obtained by a Soergel-theoretic description of both sides which extends results for finite-dimensional flag varieties by Taylor and the first author. Universal Koszul duality bundles together a whole family of equivalences for each point of a maximal torus. At the identity, it recovers an ungraded version of Beilinson-Ginzburg-Soergel's and Bezrukavnikov-Yun's Koszul duality for equivariant and unipotently monodromic sheaves. It also generalizes Soergel-theoretic descriptions for monodromic categories on finite-dimensional flag varieties by Lusztig-Yun, Gouttard and the second author. For affine Kac-Moody groups, our work sheds new light on the conjectured quantum Satake equivalences by Cautis-Kamnitzer and Gaitsgory. On our way, we establish foundations on six functors for reduced K-motives and introduce a formalism of constructible monodromic sheaves.</p></details>

We prove, in particular, that the Bogomolov property is not satisfied when $\sigma \geq \frac{1}{2}$. If $\sigma > 1$, we produce certain families of number fields having arbitrarily large degrees, whose Dedekind $\zeta$-functions $\zeta_K(s)$ attain arbitrarily small values at $s = \sigma$. On the other hand, if $\frac{1}{2} \leq \sigma \leq 1$, we construct suitable families of quadratic number fields, employing either Soundararajan's resonance method, which works when $\frac{1}{2} \leq \sigma < 1$, or results on random Euler products by Granville and Soundararajan, and by Lamzouri, which work when $\frac{1}{2} < \sigma \leq 1$. We complete the study by proving that the Dedekind $\zeta$ function together with the degree satisfies the Northcott property for every complex $s\in{\mathbb{C}}$ such that $\mathrm{Re}(s) <0$, generalizing previous work of G\'en\'ereux and Lal\'in.</p></details>
