<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Whittaker functions of $GL(n, \mathbb R)$ , are most known for its role in the Fourier-Whittaker expansion of cusp forms. Their behavior in the Siegel set, in large, is well-understood. In this paper, we insert into the literature some potentially useful properties of Whittaker function over the group $GL(n, \mathbb R)$ and the mirobolic group $P_n$. We proved the square integrabilty of the Whittaker functions with respect to certain measures, extending a theorem of Jacquet and Shalika . For principal series representations, we gave various asymptotic bounds of smooth Whittaker functions over the whole group $GL(n, \mathbb R)$. Due to the lack of good terminology, we use whittaker functions to refer to $K$-finite or smooth vectors in the Whittaker model.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the Casselman-Shalika formula for unramified groups over a non-archimedean local field by studying the action of the spherical Hecke algebra on the space of compact spherical Whittaker functions via the twisted Satake transform. This method provides a conceptual explanation of the appearance of characters of a dual group in the Casselman-Shalika formula.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper verifies $n\times 1$ Local Converse Theorem for twisted gamma factors of irreducible cuspidal representations of ${\rm GL}_n({\mathbb F}_p)$, for $n\leq 5,$ and of irreducible generic representations, for $n<\frac{q-1}{2\sqrt{q}}+1$ in the appendix by Zhiwei Yun, where $p$ is a prime and q is a power of $p$. The counterpart of $n\times 1$ converse theorem for level zero cuspidal representations also follows the established relation between gamma factors of ${\rm GL}_n({\mathcal F})$ and that of ${\rm GL}_n({\mathbb F}_q)$, where ${\mathcal F}$ denotes a $p$-adic field whose residue field is isomorphic to ${\mathbb F}_q.$ For $n=6,$ examples failed $n\times 1$ Local Converse Theorem over finite fields are provided and the authors propose a set of primitive representations, for which $n\times 1$ gamma factors should be able to detect a unique element in it. For $m,\ n\in {\mathbb N},$ in the spirit of Langlands functorial lifting, we formulate a conjecture to relate $n\times m$ gamma factors of finite fields with Gauss sums over extended fields.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2019-04-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ryan C. Chen, Samuel Marks, Matthew Tyler &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The theory of monstrous moonshine asserts that the coefficients of Hauptmoduln, including the $j$-function, coincide precisely with the graded characters of the monster module, an infinite-dimensional graded representation of the monster group. On the other hand, Lehner and Atkin proved that the coefficients of the $j$-function satisfy congruences modulo $p^n$ for $p \in \{2, 3, 5, 7, 11\}$, which led to the theory of $p$-adic modular forms. We combine these two aspects of the $j$-function to give a general theory of congruences modulo powers of primes satisfied by the Hauptmoduln appearing in monstrous moonshine. We prove that many of these Hauptmoduln satisfy such congruences, and we exhibit a relationship between these congruences and the group structure of the monster. We also find a distinguished class of subgroups of the monster with graded characters satisfying such congruences.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We explore the structure of the derived spherical Hecke algebra of a $p$-adic group, a graded associative algebra whose degree $0$ subalgebra is the classical spherical Hecke algebra. Working with $\mathbb Z/ p^a$ coefficients, we establish a Satake homomorphism relating this graded algebra to the corresponding graded algebra for the torus. We investigate the image of this homomorphism in degree $1$, as well as other properties, such as transitivity with respect to inclusion of Levi subgroups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we extend our result on a depth preserving property of the local Langlands correspondence for quasi-split unitary groups (arXiv:1804.10901) to non-quasi-split unitary groups by using the local theta correspondence. The key ingredients are a depth preserving property of the local theta correspondence proved by Pan and a description of the local theta correspondence via the local Langlands correspondence established by Gan--Ichino. To combine them, we compare splittings for metaplectic covers of unitary groups constructed by Kudla with those constructed by Pan.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 57 pages, 27 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study general properties of the dessins d'enfants associated with the Hecke congruence subgroups $Γ_0(N)$ of the modular group $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$. The definition of the $Γ_0(N)$ as the stabilisers of couples of projective lattices in a two-dimensional vector space gives an interpretation of the quotient set $Γ_0(N)\backslash\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ as the projective lattices $N$-hyperdistant from a reference one, and hence as the projective line over the ring $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$. The natural action of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ on the lattices defines a dessin d'enfant structure, allowing for a combinatorial approach to features of the classical modular curves, such as the torsion points and the cusps. We tabulate the dessins d'enfants associated with the $15$ Hecke congruence subgroups of genus zero, which arise in Moonshine for the Monster sporadic group.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2019-02-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Claus Sorensen &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 25 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article we establish a version of Koszul duality for filtered rings arising from $p$-adic Lie groups. Our precise setup is the following. We let $G$ be a uniform pro-$p$ group and consider its completed group algebra $Ω=k[\![G]\!]$ with coefficients in a finite field $k$ of characteristic $p$. It is known that $Ω$ carries a natural filtration and $\text{gr} Ω=S(\frak{g})$ where $\frak{g}$ is the (abelian) Lie algebra of $G$ over $k$. One of our main results in this paper is that the Koszul dual $\text{gr} Ω^!=\bigwedge \frak{g}^{\vee}$ can be promoted to an $A_{\infty}$-algebra in such a way that the derived category of pseudocompact $Ω$-modules $D(Ω)$ becomes equivalent to the derived category of strictly unital $A_{\infty}$-modules $D_{\infty}(\bigwedge \frak{g}^{\vee})$. In the case where $G$ is an abelian group we prove that the $A_{\infty}$-structure is trivial and deduce an equivalence between $D(Ω)$ and the derived category of differential graded modules over $\bigwedge \frak{g}^{\vee}$ which generalizes a result of Schneider for $\Bbb{Z}_p$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Convergence criterion improved. Small changes in presentation. 39 pages, 10 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a regularization procedure of period integrals of automorphic forms on a group $G$ over an arbitrary reductive subgroup $G' \subset G$. As a consequence we obtain an explicit $G'(\mathbb{A})$-invariant functional on the space of automorphic forms on $G$ whose exponents avoid certain prescribed hyperplanes. We also provide a necessary and sufficient condition for convergence of period integrals of automorphic forms in terms of their exponents.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 38 pages, comments are welcome - minor typos were corrected in the second version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The graph of a Hecke operator encodes all information about the action of this operator on automorphic forms over a global function field. These graphs were introduced by Lorscheid in his PhD thesis for $\text{PGL}_{2}$ and we generalized to $\text{GL}_{n}$ in the paper "On graphs of Hecke operators". After reviewing some general properties, we explain the connection to the Hall algebra of the function field. In the case of an elliptic function field, we can use structure results of Burban-Schiffmann and Fratila to develop an algorithm which explicitly calculate these graphs. We apply this algorithm to determine some structure constants and provide explicitly the rank two case in the last section.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2018-11-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Fangyang Tian &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 37 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Studying the analytic properties of the partial Langlands $L$-function via Rankin-Selberg method has been proved to be successful in various cases. Yet in few cases is the local theory studied at the archimedean places, which causes a tremendous gap to complete the analytic theory of the complete $L$-function. In this paper, we will establish the meromorphic continuation and the functional equation of the archimedean local integrals associated with D. Ginzburg's global integral for the adjoint representation of $\mathrm{GL}_3$. Via the local functional equation, the local gamma factor $Γ(s,π,\mathrm{Ad},ψ)$ can be defined. In a forthcoming paper, we will compute the local gamma factor $Γ(s,π,\mathrm{Ad},ψ)$ explicitly, which fills in some blanks in the archimedean local theory of Ginzburg's global integral.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>$A^2_α$ will denote the weighted $L^2$ Bergman space. Given a subset $S$ of the open unit disc we define $Ω(S)$ to be the infimum of $\{s| \exists f \in A^2_{s-2}, f\neq 0, \mbox{ having $S$ as its zero set} \}$.By classical results on Hardy space there are sets $S$ for which $Ω(S)=1$. Using von Neumann dimension techniques and cusp forms we give examples of $S$ where $1<Ω(S)<\infty$. By using a left order on certain Fuchsian groups we are able to calculate $Ω(S)$ exactly if $Ω(S)$ is the orbit of a Fuchsian group. This technique also allows us to derive in a new way well known results on zeros of cusp forms and indeed calculate the whole algebra of modular forms for \pslz.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 70 pages, to appear in Compositio Math

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper generalizes the GGP conjectures which were earlier formulated for tempered or more generally generic L-packets to Arthur packets, especially for the nongeneric L-packets arising from Arthur parameters. The paper introduces the key notion of a relevant pair of A-parameters which governs the branching laws for $GL_n$ and all classical groups over both local fields and global fields. It plays a role for all the branching problems studied in our earlier work including Bessel models and Fourier-Jacobi models.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We relate the analytic conductor of a generic irreducible representation of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{R})$ to the invariance properties of vectors in that representation. The relationship is an analytic archimedean analogue of some aspects of the classical non-archimedean newvector theory of Casselman and Jacquet--Piatetski-Shapiro--Shalika. We illustrate how this relationship may be applied in trace formulas to majorize sums over automorphic forms on $\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{Z}) \backslash \mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{R})$ ordered by analytic conductor.</p></details>

Let $\mathscr{L}$ be a torsion $G^0$-equivariant line bundle with connection on $Ω_F$. We show that the strong dual of $\mathscr{L}(Ω_F)$ is an admissible locally $F$-analytic representation of $G^0$ of topological length at most $2$. It is topologically irreducible if and only if the underlying connection on $\mathscr{L}$ is non-trivial. We give an explicit formula for the length of the strong dual of the space of globally-defined rigid analytic functions on a $G^0$-equivariant finite étale rigid analytic covering of $Ω_F$ with abelian Galois group as an admissible locally $F$-analytic representation of $G^0$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 13 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $ρ\colon G\to \mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ be an continuous irreducible representation of a compact group over a complete discretely valued field $K$. Let $W_i,W_j$ be two irreducible subrepresentations of $\overlineρ^{ss}$, the semisimplification of the residual representation. We study the structure of the $G$-stable lattices $Λ\subseteq K^n$ with a view to understanding the question of when $ρ$ realises a non-split extension of $W_i$ by $W_j$. In particular, we introduce the notion of a maximal $G$-stable lattice and prove that any non-split extension of $W_i$ by $W_j$ that can be realised by $ρ$ can also be realised by a maximal lattice. As applications, we give a new proof and a strengthening of Bellaïche's generalisation of Ribet's Lemma, which assures the abundancy of non-split extensions that can be realised by $ρ$. On the other hand, we also show that, if the representations $W_i, W_j$ occur with multiplicity one in $\overlineρ^{ss}$, then $ρ$ can realise at most one non-split extension of $W_i$ by $W_j$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2011-08-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jens Funke, John Millson &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In our previous paper [math.NT/0408050], we established a correspondence between vector-valued holomorphic Siegel modular forms and cohomology with local coefficients for local symmetric spaces $X$ attached to real orthogonal groups of type $(p,q)$. This correspondence is realized using theta functions associated to explicitly constructed "special" Schwartz forms. Furthermore, the theta functions give rise to generating series of certain "special cycles" in $X$ with coefficients. In this paper, we study the boundary behaviour of these theta functions in the non-compact case and show that the theta functions extend to the Borel-Sere compactification $\bar{X}$ of $X$. However, for the $\Q$-split case for signature $(p,p)$, we have to construct and consider a slightly larger compactification, the "big" Borel-Serre compactification. The restriction to each face of $\bar{X}$ is again a theta series as in [math.NT/0408050], now for a smaller orthogonal group and a larger coefficient system. As application we establish the cohomological nonvanishing of the special (co)cycles when passing to an appropriate finite cover of $X$. In particular, the (co)homology groups in question do not vanish.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the semisimplicity conjecture for A-motives over finitely generated fields K. This conjecture states that the rational Tate modules V_p(M) of a semisimple A-motive M are semisimple as representations of the absolute Galois group of K. This theorem is in analogy with known results for abelian varieties and Drinfeld modules, and has been sketched previously by Akio Tamagawa. We deduce two consequences of the theorem for the algebraic monodromy groups G_p(M) associated to an A-motive M by Tannakian duality. The first requires no semisimplicity condition on M and states that G_p(M) may be identified naturally with the Zariski closure of the image of the absolute Galois group of K in the automorphism group of V_p(M). The second states that the connected component of G_p(M) is reductive if M is semisimple and has a separable endomorphism algebra.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is known that there is a one-to-one correspondence between equivalence classes of primitive indefinite binary quadratic forms and primitive hyperbolic conjugacy classes of the modular group. Due to such a correspondence, Sarnak obtained the asymptotic formula for the class number sum in order of the fundamental unit by using the prime geodesic theorem for the modular group. In the present paper, we propose asymptotic formulas of the class number sums over discriminants in arithmetic progressions. Since there are relations between the arithmetic properties of the discriminants and the conjugacy classes in the finite groups given by the modular group and its congruence subgroups, we can get the desired asymptotic formulas by arranging the Tchebotarev-type prime geodesic theorem. While such asymptotic formulas were already given by Raulf, the approaches are quite different, the expressions of the leading terms of our asymptotic formulas are simpler and the estimates of the reminder terms are sharper.</p></details>

This reduction map is a component of a functor from smooth $p$-power torsion representations of $p$-adic reductive groups (or more generally of Borel subgroups of these) to $(φ,Γ)$-modules. Therefore this gives evidence for this functor---which is intended as some kind of $p$-adic Langlands correspondence for reductive groups---to be exact. We also show that the corresponding higher $\Tor$-functors vanish. Moreover, we give the example of the Steinberg representation as an illustration and show that it is acyclic for this functor to $(φ,Γ)$-modules whenever our reductive group is $\GL_{d+1}(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ for some $d\geq 1$.</p></details>

This confirms an expectation of local-global compatibility in the mod $p$ Langlands program. To prove our result, we develop a local model theory for multitype deformation rings and new methods to work with patched modules that are not free over their scheme-theoretic support.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ be a finite extension with residue field $k$. By a work of Emerton--Gee, irreducible components inside the reduced special fiber of the moduli stack of rank $n$ étale $(\varphi,Γ)$-modules are labeled by Serre weights of $\mathrm{GL}_n(k)$. Let $σ$ be a non-Steinberg Serre weight and $\mathcal{C}_σ$ be the corresponding irreducible component. Motivated by the categorical $p$-adic local Langlands program, we construct a natural injective map $\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{C}_σ) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{H}(σ)$ from the ring of global functions on $\mathcal{C}_σ$ to the Hecke algebra of $σ$ compatible with the mod $p$ Satake isomorphism by Herzig and Henniart--Vignéras in a suitable sense. For sufficiently generic $σ$, we prove that it is an isomorphism. As an application, we obtain a natural stratification of the irreducible component whose strata are equipped with a parabolic structure. Our main input is a construction of a morphism from an integral Hecke algebra of a generic tame type to the ring of global functions on a tamely potentially crystalline Emerton--Gee stack.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a p-adic classical group (orthogonal, symplectic, unitary) and $π$ be an epipelagic representation of $G$ defined by Reeder-Yu. Using Mœglin's theory of extended cuspidal supports and Bushnell-Kutzko's theory of covering types, we determine the endoscopic lift of $π$ into the general linear group whose dual expresses the dual group of $G$ as a complex matrix group, explicitly in terms of the inducing type of $π$ that is extended from the character of the first Moy-Prasad filtration subgroup defined by a stable functional. We interpret the inducing type of $π$ via Stevens' construction of supercuspidal representations by skew semi-simple strata, and introduce the so-called epipelagic strata, which only require the residual characteristic p to be odd. As an application, we reprove the results of M. Oi on the endoscopic lifts of Gross-Reeder's simple supercuspidal representations of quasi-split classical groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct special cycles on the moduli stack of unitary shtukas. We prove an identity between (1) the r-th central derivative of non-singular Fourier coefficients of a normalized Siegel--Eisenstein series, and (2) the degree of special cycles of "virtual dimension 0" on the moduli stack of unitary shtukas with r legs. This may be viewed as a function-field analogue of the Kudla-Rapoport Conjecture, that has the additional feature of encompassing all higher derivatives of the Eisenstein series.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish several new properties of the $p$-adic Jacquet-Langlands functor defined by Scholze in terms of the cohomology of the Lubin-Tate tower. In particular, we reprove Scholze's basic finiteness theorems, prove a duality theorem, and show a kind of partial Künneth formula. Using these results, we deduce bounds on Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, together with some new vanishing and nonvanishing results. Our key new tool is the six functor formalism with solid almost $\mathcal{O}^+/p$-coefficients developed recently by the second author [Man22]. One major point of this paper is to extend the domain of validity of the $!$-functor formalism developed in [Man22] to allow certain "stacky" maps. In the language of this extended formalism, we show that if $G$ is a $p$-adic Lie group, the structure map of the classifying small v-stack $B\underline{G}$ is $p$-cohomologically smooth.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G=\mathrm{GL}_{2n}(\mathbb{R})$ or $G=\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{H})$ and $H=\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ regarded as a subgroup of $G$. Here, $\mathbb{H}$ is the quaternion division algebra over $\mathbb{R}$. For a character $χ$ on $\mathbb{C}^\times$, we say that an irreducible smooth admissible moderate growth representation $π$ of $G$ is $χ_H$-distinguished if $\mathrm{Hom}_H(π, χ\circ\det_H)\neq0$. We compute the root number of a $χ_H$-distinguished representation $π$ twisted by the representation induced from $χ$. This proves an Archimedean analogue of the conjecture by Prasad and Takloo-Bighash (J. Reine Angew. Math., 2011). The proof is based on the analysis of the contribution of $H$-orbits in a flag manifold of $G$ to the Schwartz homology of principal series representations. A large part of the argument is developed for general real reductive groups of inner type. In particular, we prove that the Schwartz homology $H_\ast(H, π\otimesχ)$ is finite-dimensional and hence it is Hausdorff for a reductive symmetric pair $(G, H)$ and a finite-dimensional representation $χ$ of $H$.</p></details>

This method can be used to reprove the results on the Whittaker support of automorphic forms of such kind proven by D. Ginzburg, Y. Cai and B. Liu. This method will also yield new results on the Eulerianity of certain degenerate Whittaker coefficients.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a split reductive group over a number field $F$. We consider the computation of the inner product of two $K$-spherical pseudo Eisenstein series of $G$ supported in $[T,\mathcal{O}(1)]$ by means of residues, following a classical approach initiated by Langlands. We show that only the singularities of the intertwining operators due to the poles of the completed Dedekind zeta function $Λ_F$ contribute to the spectrum, while the singularities caused by the zeroes of $Λ_F$ do not contribute to any of the iterated residues which arise as a result of the necessary contour shifts. In the companion paper [DMHO] we use this result to explicitly determine the spectral measure of $L^2(G(F)\backslash G(\mathbb{A}_F),ξ)^K_{[T,\mathcal{O}(1)]}$ by a comparison of the iterated residues with the residue distributions of [HO1].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study unramified unitary and unitary similitude groups in an odd number of variables. Using work of the first and third named authors on the Kottwitz Conjecture for the similitude groups, we show that the Fargues--Scholze local Langlands correspondence agrees with the semi-simplification of the local Langlands correspondences constructed by Mok for the groups we consider. This compatibility result is then combined with the spectral action constructed by Fargues--Scholze, to verify their categorical form of the local Langlands conjecture for supercuspidal $\ell$-parameters. We deduce Fargues' eigensheaf conjecture and prove the strongest form of Kottwitz's conjecture for the groups we consider, even in the case of non minuscule $μ$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2021-12-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Caihua Luo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Intertwining operators play an essential role and appear everywhere in the Langlands program, their analytic properties interact directly, yet deeply with the decomposition of parabolic induction locally and the residues of Eisenstein series globally. Inspired by the profound Langlands-Shahidi theory, Casselman-Shahidi conjectured that a certain normalization factor would govern the singularity of intertwining operators for generic standard modules. Indeed, motivated by the theory of theta correspondence, especially the Siegel-Weil formula globally, and the composition problem of degenerate principal series and the demand of a g.c.d. definition of standard $L$-functions in the framework of the doubling method locally, an optimal normalization factor has been determined for degenerate principal series of classical groups via the theory of integrals on prehomogeneous vector spaces. Such a method seems impossible to be generalized to work even in the setting of degenerate generalized principal series, which are naturally involved in the recent Cai-Friedberg-Ginzburg-Kaplan's generalized doubling method. To circumvent it, we discover a new uniform argument that can answer the singularity problem of intertwining operators for a large class of induced representations. As an illustration, we prove the aforementioned Casselman-Shahidi conjecture for quasi-split groups of classical type in the paper. Along the way, with the help of Shahidi's local coefficient theory, we also prove that those normalized intertwining operators are always non-zero, and provide a new one-sentence proof of the standard module conjecture in the spirit of Casselman-Shahidi.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field and $G$ be a connected reductive group over $F$. For a Bernstein block in the category of smooth complex representations of $G(F)$, we have two kinds of progenerators: the compactly induced representation $\text{ind}_{K}^{G(F)} (ρ)$ of a type $(K, ρ)$, and the parabolically induced representation $I_{P}^{G}(Π^{M})$ of a progenerator $Π^{M}$ of a Bernstein block for a Levi subgroup $M$ of $G$. In this paper, we construct an explicit isomorphism of these two progenerators. Moreover, we compare the description of the endomorphism algebra $\text{End}_{G(F)}\left(\text{ind}_{K}^{G(F)} (ρ)\right)$ for a depth-zero type $(K, ρ)$ by Morris with the description of the endomorphism algebra $\text{End}_{G(F)}\left(I_{P}^{G}(Π^{M})\right)$ by Solleveld, that are described in terms of affine Hecke algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The near-completion of the program of endoscopy poses the question of what lies next. This article takes a broad view of ideas beyond the program of endoscopy, highlighting the connections among them, and emphasizing the relationship between local and global aspects. Central among those ideas is the one proposed in a 2000 lecture of R. P. Langlands, aiming to extract from the stable trace formula of a group G the bulk of those automorphic representations in the image of the conjectural functorial lift corresponding to a morphism of L-groups ${^LH} \to {^LG}$. With the extension of the problem of functoriality to the "relative" setting of spherical varieties and related spaces, some structure behind such comparisons has started to reveal itself. In a seemingly unrelated direction, a program initiated by Braverman--Kazhdan, also around 2000, to generalize the Godement--Jacquet proof of the functional equation to arbitrary L-functions, has received renewed attention in recent years. We survey ideas and developments in this direction, as well, and discuss the relationship between the two programs.</p></details>

To do so, we introduce an algebro-combinatorial model for these modules and develop for them a Kazhdan-Lusztig theory involving new generic parameters. These parameters can either be specialized to Gauss sums to recover the $p$-adic theory or to the natural grading parameter in the representation theory of quantum groups. As an application of our results, we deduce geometric Casselman-Shalika type results for metaplectic covers, conjectured in a slightly different form by S. Lysenko, as well as prove a variant of G. Savin's local Shimura type correspondences at the Whittaker level.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: Added a lemma (4.1.4) that further clarifies relationship to Kottwitz's work on transfer factors for Lie algebras. Revised introduction. Main results unchanged

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a quasi-split connected reductive group $G$ over a local field $F$ we define a compact abelian group $\tildeπ_1(G)$ and an extension $1 \to \tildeπ_1(G) \to G(F)_\infty \to G(F) \to 1$ of topological groups equipped with a splitting over $G_\textrm{sc}(F)$. Any character $x : \tildeπ_1(G) \to μ_n(\mathbb{C})$ leads to an $n$-fold cover $G(F)_x$ of $G(F)$ via pushout. We define an $L$-group $^LG_x$ for this cover that is generally a non-split extension of $\textrm{Gal}(F^s/F)$ by $\hat G$. We prove a refined local Langlands correspondence for $G(F)_x$, assuming it is known for connected reductive groups with the same adjoint group as $G$. Motivation for this construction comes from considerations of Langlands' functoriality conjecture, where subgroups $\mathcal{H} \subset {^LG}$ of the $L$-group of $G$ arise that need not be $L$-groups of other reductive groups. If such a subgroup is full and intersects $\hat G$ in a connected reductive subgroup of maximal rank, we construct a natural triple $(H,x,ξ)$ consisting of a quasi-split connected reductive group $H$, a double cover $H(F)_x$, and an $L$-embedding $ξ: {^LH}_x \to {^LG}$ that is an isomorphism onto $\mathcal{H}$. We expect that genuine representations of $H(F)_x$ transfer functorially to representations of $G(F)$. In the special case of endoscopy, we show that the construction of transfer factors simplifies when the natural double cover $H(F)_x$ of the endoscopic group is used. The transfer factor becomes the product of two natural invariants that do not depend on auxiliary choices. One of them is closely related to Kottwitz's work on transfer factors for Lie algebras. The other one is not specific to the case of endoscopy, and will likely play a role in general functoriality questions. Our work is motivated by work of Adams and Vogan over the real numbers.</p></details>

Specifically, our main result shows that for certain covers of $\mathrm{GL}(r)$ the Gelfand--Graev functor is related to quantum affine Schur--Weyl duality. Consequently, the commuting algebra of the Iwahori-fixed part of the Gelfand--Graev representation is the quotient of a quantum group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a reductive algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}$ and $Γ\subset G(\mathbb{Q})$ an arithmetic subgroup. Let $K_\infty\subset G(\mathbb{R})$ be a maximal compact subgroup. We study the asymptotic behavior of the counting functions of the cuspidal and residual spectrum, respectively, of the regular representation of $G(\mathbb{R})$ in $L^2(Γ\backslash G(\mathbb{R}))$ of a fixed $K_\infty$-type $σ$. A conjecture, which is due to Sarnak, states that the counting function of the cuspidal spectrum of type $σ$ satisfies Weyl's law and the residual spectrum is of lower order growth. Using the Arthur trace formula we reduce the conjecture to a problem about $L$-functions occurring in the constant terms of Eisenstein series. If $G$ satisfies property (L), introduced by Finis and Lapid, we establish the conjecture. This includes classical groups over a number field.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A paper of Reeder-Yu gives a construction of epipelagic supercuspidal representations of $p$-adic groups. The input for this construction is a pair $(λ, χ)$ where $λ$ is a stable vector in a certain representation coming from a Moy-Prasad filtration, and $χ$ is a character of the additive group of the residue field. We say two such pairs are equivalent if the resulting supercuspidal representations are isomorphic. In this paper we describe the equivalence classes of such pairs. As an application, we give a classification of the simple supercuspidal representations for split adjoint groups. Finally, under an assumption about unramified base change, we describe properties of the Langlands parameters associated to these simple supercuspidals, showing that they have trivial L-functions and minimal Swan conductors, and showing that each of these simple supercuspidals lies in a singleton L-packet.</p></details>
