> **Comment:** 34 pages, 2 figures. To appear in Comm. Amer. Math. Soc

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a geometric criterion for local microlocal holonomies to be globally regular on the moduli space of Lagrangian fillings. This local-to-global regularity result holds for arbitrary Legendrian links and it is a key input for the study of cluster structures on such moduli spaces. Specifically, we construct regular functions on derived moduli stacks of sheaves with Legendrian microsupport by studying the Hochschild homology of the associated dg-categories via relative Lagrangian skeleta. In this construction, a key geometric result is that local microlocal merodromies along positive relative cycles in Lagrangian fillings yield global Hochschild 0-cycles for these dg-categories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine an infinite family of linear identities for the number $A_4(n)$ of partition pairs of $n$ with $4$-cores by employing elementary $q$-series techniques and certain $3$-dissection formulas. We then discover an infinite family of congruences for $A_4(n)$ as a consequence of these linear identities.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Luis Crespo, Álvaro Pelayo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.SG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 62 Pages, 9 Figures. This paper is a sequel (part II), to arXiv:2501.14444 (part I). Part I contained classification statements concerning p-adic integrable systems and p-adic matrices. In Part I we gave proofs of all statements concerning p-adic integrable systems. In part II we provide proofs of all statements (which we repeat to be as self contained as possible) concerning p-adic matrices

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is a sequel to arXiv:2501.14444, in which we shall give proofs of several results stated in arXiv:2501.14444 (Theorems D--L) which, for brevity and clarity, we postponed to this sequel paper. These results were the following: for any prime number $p$, first we show that every $2$-by-$2$ symmetric matrix with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ can be reduced to a canonical form, and we give the exact numbers of families of normal forms with one parameter and of isolated normal forms, which depend on $p$. Then we make the same analysis for $4$-by-$4$ matrices. We also prove that, for higher size, the number of families of normal forms of matrices, even in the non-degenerate case, grows almost exponentially with the size. The paper can be read independently of arXiv:2501.14444 as we recall the statements of arXiv:2501.14444 that we shall prove here. The statements and proofs of the present paper are of an algebraic and arithmetical nature, and rely mainly on Galois theory of $p$-adic extension fields.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Eric Ahlqvist, Richard Pink &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 31 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any imaginary quadratic field $K$, the Galois group $G_K$ of its maximal unramified pro-$3$-extension is a Schur $σ$-group. If this has Zassenhaus type $(3,3)$, there are 13 possibilities for the isomorphism class of the finite quotient $G_K/D_4(G_K)$. We prove that for 10 of these 13 cases $G_K$ is either finite or isomorphic to an open subgroup of a form of $\mathop{\rm PGL}_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}_3$. Combined with the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture, or with earlier work on an analogue of the Cohen--Lenstra heuristic for Schur $σ$-groups, this lends credence to the "if" part of a conjecture of McLeman. Using explicit computations of triple Massey products, we also test the heuristic for all imaginary quadratic fields $K$ with $d(G_K)=2$ and discriminant $-10^8 < d_K < 0$ and find a reasonably good agreement.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Wan Keng Cheong, Ngau Lam &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an equivalence between the actions of the Gaudin algebras with irregular singularities for $\mathfrak{gl}_d$ and $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$ on the Fock space of $d(p+m)$ bosonic and $d(q+n)$ fermionic oscillators. This establishes a duality of $(\mathfrak{gl}_d, \mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n})$ for Gaudin models. As an application, we show that the Gaudin algebra with irregular singularities for $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$ acts cyclically on each weight space of a certain class of infinite-dimensional modules over a direct sum of Takiff superalgebras over $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$ and that the action is diagonalizable with a simple spectrum under a generic condition. We also study the classical versions of Gaudin algebras with irregular singularities and demonstrate a duality of $(\mathfrak{gl}_d, \mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n})$ for classical Gaudin models.</p></details>

In this article, we study the Beilinson--Bloch--Kato conjecture for motives associated to irreducible cuspidal automorphic representations $π$ of $G(\mathbb{A}_{F^+}).$ We prove that if $π$ is distinguished by the unitary Friedberg--Jacquet period, then the Bloch--Kato Selmer group (with coefficients in a favorable field) of the motive of $Π=\mathrm{BC}(π)$ vanishes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For all $r\ge1,$ we verify the following conjecture of Hironaka: for a $p$-adic field $F$ with $p$ odd, the space of spherical functions of $\mathrm{Sym}_{r\times r}(F)\cap\mathrm{GL}_r(F)$ is free of rank $4^r$ over the Hecke algebra.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages, final published version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We evaluate some series with summands involving a single binomial coefficient $\binom{6k}{3k}$. For example, we prove that $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(63k^2+78k+22)8^k}{(2k+1)(6k+1)(6k+5)\binom{6k}{3k}}=\frac{3π}2.$$ Motivated by Galois theory, we introduce the so-called Duality Principle for irrational series of Ramanujan's type or Zeilberger's type, and apply it to find 26 new irrational series identities. For example, we conjecture that \begin{align*}&\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{(32(91\sqrt{33}-523))^{k}}{k^3\binom{2k}k^2\binom{3k}k} \left((91\sqrt{33}+891)k-33\sqrt{33}-225\right) \\&\qquad=320\left(\frac{11}3\sqrt{33}L_{-11}(2)-27L_{-3}(2)\right), \end{align*} where $ L_{d}(2)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{(\frac{d}k)}{k^2}$ for any integer $d\equiv0,1\pmod4$ with $(\frac{d}k)$ the Kronecker symbol.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine the Picard number and the Ulrich complexity of general bidouble covers of the projective plane, providing the first systematic study of Ulrich bundles on non-cyclic abelian covers. For a bidouble plane branched along three smooth curves of degrees $n_1,n_2,n_3$, we show that $ρ(S)=1$ unless $(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ belongs to an explicit list, thereby extending Buium's classical results on double planes to the non-cyclic case. As an application, we determine the range of branch degrees for which Ulrich line bundles could exist. Our method combines the invariant-theoretic decomposition of $H^2(S,\mathbb{Q})$ under the Galois group with cohomological criteria for Ulrich bundles.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages, final published version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study a family of polynomials $$S_n^{(m)}(x):=\sum_{i,j=0}^n\binom ni^m\binom nj^m\binom{i+j}ix^{i+j}\ \ (m,n=0,1,2,\ldots).$$ For example, we show that $$\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}S_k^{(0)}(x)\equiv\frac x{2x-1}\left(1+\left(\frac{1-4x^2}p\right)\right)\pmod p $$ for any odd prime $p$ and integer $x\not\equiv1/2\pmod p$, where $(\frac{\cdot}p)$ denotes the Legendre symbol. We also formulate some open conjectures on related congruences and series for $1/π$. For example, we conjecture that $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty(7k+1)\frac{S_k^{(2)}(1/11)}{9^k}=\frac{5445}{104\sqrt{39}\,π}$$ and $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty(1365k+181)\frac{S_k^{(2)}(1/18)}{16^k}=\frac{1377}{\sqrt2\,π}.$$</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Martin Jann, Steffen Kionke &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 5 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Here we show that the Weil abscissa of the procyclic groups $\prod_{p \in S} \mathbb{Z}_p$ equals $2$ for three sets $S$: (i) the set of primes $p \equiv 1 \bmod 3$, (ii) the set of primes $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$ and (iii) the set of primes $p \equiv 1,3 \bmod 8$. Our argument is based on the observation that integers all of whose prime factors lie in $S$ can be represented by a suitable binary quadratic form, which allows us to use a theorem of Iwaniec to exhibit a minorant for the Weil representation zeta function.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hartosh Singh Bal &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study frequency moments of partition statistics arising from Euler products $A(q)=\prod_{r\ge1}(1-q^r)^{-c(r)}$ via a transform that expresses the moment generating functions as $B(q)$ times explicit divisor--sum series determined by $c(r)$. When $A(q)$ is modular (typically an $η$--quotient), this yields (quasi)modular forms whose coefficients can be projected to arithmetic progressions and certified modulo primes by a Sturm bound, giving an effective pipeline for detecting and proving Ramanujan--type congruences for frequency moments. For ordinary partitions we recover and certify several congruences for odd moments in nonzero residue classes (e.g.\ $M_3(7n+5)\equiv 0\pmod7$ and $M_3(11n+6)\equiv 0\pmod{11}$). As a second input, we apply the same pipeline to overpartitions and certify a family of zero--class congruences $M_m^{\overline{\ }}(\ell n)\equiv 0\pmod{\ell}$ (including $m=5,7,11,13$), exhibiting a sharp contrast with the ordinary partition case: no nonzero residue--class congruences are observed for overpartition moments in our scan range. We also demonstrate that filtering the statistic via the Glaisher--character dictionary can itself create new Ramanujan--type progressions, e.g.\ a quadratic twist yields the certified congruence $\widehat{M}^{χ_5}_3(5n+4)\equiv 0\pmod{5}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 38 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a refined version of Markov's theorem in Diophantine approximation. More precisely, we characterize completely the set of irrationals $x$ such that $\left|x-\frac{p}{q}\right|<\frac{1}{3q^2}$ has only finitely many rational solutions: their continued fraction is eventually a balanced sequence through a simple coding. As consequence, we show that all such numbers are either quadratic surds or transcendental numbers. In particular, for any algebraic real number $x$ of degree at least $3$ there are infinitely rational numbers $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $\left|x-\frac{p}{q}\right|<\frac{1}{3q^2}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $Q_1,...,Q_r\in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ be polynomials having $0$ as a root.

Fix some positive integers $A_1,...,A_r$. We show that under certain conditions, the diophantine equation $\prod_{i=1}^rQ_i(A_i^{n_i}n_i!)=f(x,y)$ has finitely many integer solutions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 29 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notions of local realizability at a prime and algebraic realizability of an integer sequence. After discussing this notion in general we consider it for the Euler numbers, the Bernoulli denominators, and the Bernoulli numerators. This gives, for example, a dynamical characterization of the Bernoulli regular primes. Algebraic realizability of the Bernoulli denominators is shown at every prime, giving a different perspective on the great diversity of congruences satisfied by this sequence. We show that the sequence of Euler numbers cannot be realized on a nilpotent group, which may explain why it is less hospitable to congruence hunting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By the work of Hernandez-Leclerc, Leclerc-Plamondon, and Keller-Scherotzke, affine graded Nakajima quiver varieties associated with a Dynkin quiver $Q$ admit an algebraic description in terms of modules over the singular Nakajima category $\mathcal{S}$ and a stratification functor to the derived category of $Q$. In this paper, we extend this framework to Nakajima's $n$-fold affine graded tensor product varieties, which allow one to geometrically realize $n$-fold tensor products of standard modules over the quantum affine algebra. We introduce a category of filtrations with splitting of length $n$ of modules over a category and show that it is equivalent to the module category of a triangular matrix category. Applied to the singular Nakajima category, this yields a category $\mathcal{S}^{n\mathrm{-filt}}$ whose modules are parametrized by the points of the $n$-fold tensor product varieties. Generalizing the results of Keller-Scherotzke from $\mathcal{S}$ to $\mathcal{S}^{n\mathrm{-filt}}$, we prove that the stable category of pseudo-coherent Gorenstein projective $\mathcal{S}^{n\mathrm{-filt}}$-modules is triangle equivalent to the derived category of the algebra of $n \times n$ upper triangular matrices over the path algebra of $Q$, and we obtain a corresponding stratification functor.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We represent the Euler alternating series (sometimes called the "Dirichlet eta function"), and generally $(b^s-b)ζ(s)/b^s$ for $b>1$ an integer, in the half-plane $\Re s>0$, via series dominated by geometric series, with arbitrarily small convergence ratio (up to the prize of a longer first approximation). Due to the underlying recurrence, the cost for each new term is at first sight linearly increasing, so the cost appears to be quadratic in the number of terms kept. And the number of terms needed to achieve a given target precision increases linearly with the imaginary part of $s$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Nous démontrons l'invariance Galoisienne de la propriété d'annulation en $1/2$ des fonctions L standard ou de Rankin-Selberg pour certaines représentations automorphes cuspidales algébriques régulières autoduales ou autoduales conjuguées de groupes linéaires sur un corps de nombres arbitraire. La démonstration repose sur l'utilisation de la cohomologie pondérée de Goresky-Harder-MacPherson et sur la construction de certaines représentations automorphes discrètes pour les groupes classiques comme résidus de séries d'Eisenstein.

Waldspurger et l'un d'entre nous, démontrant l'holomorphie et la non-annulation de certains opérateurs d'entrelacement normalisés. Nous démontrons également l'invariance Galoisienne des facteurs epsilon correspondants, impliquant l'invariance Galoisienne de la parité de l'ordre d'annulation en $1/2$ de ces fonctions $L$. -- We prove the invariance under the Galois group of the vanishing at $1/2$ of standard and Rankin-Selberg L-functions for certain self-dual or conjugate self-dual algebraic cuspidal automorphic representations for general linear groups over an arbitrary number field.

New difficulties appear concerning certain intertwining operators. These are solved in the appendix by J.-L. Waldspurger and O. Taïbi proving the holomorphy and non-vanishing of these operators. We also prove the Galois invariance of epsilon factors, implying Galois invariance of the parity of the order at $1/2$ of L-functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a new method for combining two cotorsion pairs to obtain an abelian model structure and we apply it to construct and study a new model structure on left $R$-modules over a left coherent ring $R$. Its class of fibrant objects is generated by the weakly Ding injective $R$-modules, a class of modules recently studied by Iacob. We give several characterizations of the fibrant modules, one being that they are the cycle modules of certain acyclic complexes of FP-injective (i.e., absolutely pure) $R$-modules. In the case that $R$ is a Ding-Chen ring, we show that they are precisely the modules appearing as cycles of acyclic complexes of FP-injectives. This leads to a new description of the stable module category of a Ding-Chen ring $R$, by way of modules we call Gorenstein FP-pro-injective. These are modules that appear as a cycle module of a totally acyclic complex of FP-projective-injective modules. As a completely separate application of the new model category method, we show that all complete cotorsion pairs, even non-hereditary ones, lift to abelian models for the derived category of a ring.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In our previous paper with Tudor Pădurariu, we introduced the notion of limit categories for moduli stacks of Higgs bundles and formulated the Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence. These limit categories are expected to provide an effective ``classical limit'' of the categories of D-modules on the moduli stack of bundles, and our formulation links categorical Donaldson-Thomas theory with the geometric Langlands correspondence. In this paper, we prove the above Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence for $\GL_2$ over the locus in the Hitchin base where the spectral curves are reduced. This is the first non-trivial case in which the relevant moduli stacks are not quasi-compact, and the use of limit categories is essential to the formulation and proof of the correspondence. Our approach also outlines a strategy for proving the correspondence in greater generality and explains the current obstructions to such an extension.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the question whether a real threefold X fibred into quadric surfaces over the real projective line is stably rational (over R) if the topological space X(R) is connected. We give a counterexample. When all geometric fibres are irreducible, the question is open. We investigate a family of such fibrations for which the intermediate jacobian technique is not available. We produce two independent methods which in many cases enable one to prove decomposition of the diagonal.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>About 40 years ago Jonathan and Peter Borwein discovered the series identity $$ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n(6n)!}{(3n)!(n!)^3} \frac{(A+nB)}{C^{n+1/2}} = \frac{1}{12π} $$ where \begin{align*} A&=1657145277365+212175710912\sqrt{61},\cr B&=107578229802750+13773980892672\sqrt{61},\cr C&=\left(5280(236674+30303\sqrt{61})\right)^3 \end{align*} which adds roughly 25 digits of accuracy per term. They noted that if each of the quadratic irrationals $A$, $B$ and $C$ is replaced by their conjugates, that is, each number $a+b\sqrt{61}$ is changed to $a-b\sqrt{61}$, then the resulting series also converges to a rational multiple of $1/π$. They gave several other examples of quadratic irrational series for $1/π$, and noted that the conjugate series converges to another rational multiple of $1/π$ or in some cases the conjugate series diverges. The purpose of this work is to provide an explanation and classification of such series. Our classification includes Ramanujan's 17 original series, as well as series of the Borweins, Chudnovskys, Sato and others. We extend the classification to genus-zero subgroups $Γ_0(\ell)+$, that is, for each $\ell \in \big\{1,2,3,\ldots,36,38,39,41,42,44,45,46,47,49,50,51,54,55,56,59,60,62,66,69,70, 71,78,87,92,94,95,105,110,119\big\}$ we calculate the Hauptmoduls, associated weight two modular forms, and the corresponding rational and real quadratic irrational series for $1/π$. The classification reveals many interrelations among the different series. For example, we show that the Borweins' series above, and its conjugate, are equivalent by hypergeometric transformation formulas to the level~7 rational series $$ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left\{\sum_{j=0}^n {n \choose j}^2{2j \choose n} {n+j \choose j}\right\} (11895n+1286) \frac{(-1)^n}{22^{3n+3}} = \frac{1}{π\sqrt{7}}. $$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a Kac-Moody group, split over $\mathbb R$. The totally nonnegative part of $G$ and its (ordinary) flag variety $G/B^+$ was introduced by Lusztig. It is known that the totally nonnegative parts of $G$ and $G/B^+$ have remarkable combinatorial and topological properties. In this paper, we consider the totally nonnegative part of the $J$-twisted flag variety $G/{}^J B^+$, where ${}^J B^+$ is the Borel subgroup opposite to $B^+$ in the standard parabolic subgroup $P_J^+$ of $G$. The $J$-twisted flag varieties include the ordinary flag variety $G/B^+$ as a special case. Our main result show that the totally nonnegative part of $G/{}^J B^+$ decomposes into cells, and the closure of each cell is a regular CW complex. This generalizes the work of Galashin-Karp-Lam \cite{GKL22} and the joint work of Bao with the first author \cite{BH24} for ordinary flag varieties. As an application, we deduce that the totally nonnegative part of the double flag variety $G/B^+ \times G/B^-$ with respect to the diagonal $G$-action has similar nice properties. We also establish some connections between the totally nonnegative part of the double flag with the canonical basis of the tensor product of a lowest weight module with a highest weight module of $G$. As another application, we show that the link of identity in a totally nonnegative reduced double Bruhat cell of $G$ is a regular CW complex. This generalizes the work of Hersh \cite{Her14} on the link of $U_{\geq0}^-$ and gives a positive answer to an open question of Fomin and Zelevinsky.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the properties of Hecke operator for sesquiharmonic Maass forms. We begin by proving Hecke equivariance of the divisor lifting with respect to sesquiharmonic Mass functions, which maps an integral weight meromorphic modular form to the holomorphic part of the Fourier expansion of a weight 2 sesquiharmonic Maass form. Using this Hecke equivariance, we show that the sesquiharmonic Maass functions, whose images under the hyperbolic Laplace operator are the Faber polynomials $J_n$ of the $j$-function, form a Hecke system analogous to $J_n$. By combining the Hecke equivariance of the divisor lifting with that of the Borcherds isomorphism, we extend Matsusaka's finding on the twisted traces of sesquiharmonic Maass functions.</p></details>

We prove a parametrization of the irreducible components of maximal possible dimension, in terms of alcove walks of maximal possible dimension.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate how enhanced Koszul properties of Galois cohomology behave under composita of fields. Given fields $K_1$ and $K_2$ containing $μ_p$, with intersection $k$ and compositum $K = K_1K_2$, we formulate an abstract composita stability theorem: under a pro-$p$ amalgam decomposition $G_K \cong G_{K_1} *_{G_k} G_{K_2}$ of maximal pro-$p$ Galois groups, and natural Mayer-Vietoris compatibility assumptions on the mod-$p$ cohomology rings $H^\bullet(G_{K_1},\mathbb F_p)$, $H^\bullet(G_{K_2},\mathbb F_p)$, and $H^\bullet(G_k,\mathbb F_p)$, the quadratic presentation of $H^\bullet(G_K,\mathbb F_p)$ arises from a fiber-product construction on degree-$1$ generators and quadratic relations. Assuming stability of universal Koszulity under this quadratic gluing, we obtain that universal Koszulity of $H^\bullet(G_{K_1},\mathbb F_p)$ and $H^\bullet(G_{K_2},\mathbb F_p)$ implies universal Koszulity of $H^\bullet(G_K,\mathbb F_p)$. As a concrete application, we prove a composita stability theorem for certain Pythagorean fields whose maximal pro-$2$ Galois groups decompose as free pro-$2$ products of Demuškin groups and free factors. For suitable composita $K = K_1K_2$ of such fields, the mod-$2$ Galois cohomology ring $H^\bullet(G_K(2),\mathbb F_2)$ remains quadratic and universally Koszul. This provides large classes of fields, built from local, global, and Pythagorean base fields by admissible extensions and composita, whose maximal pro-$p$ Galois groups have universally Koszul cohomology, and yields inverse Galois obstructions: any finitely generated pro-$p$ group with nonquadratic or non-universally Koszul mod-$p$ cohomology cannot occur as the maximal pro-$p$ Galois group of a field in these families.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Lagrange spectrum $L$ is the set of finite values of the best approximation constants $k(α)=\limsup_{|p|,|q|\to \infty}|q(qα-p)|^{-1}$, where $α\in \mathbb{R}\setminus \mathbb{Q}$. It is a classical result that the pairs $(p,q)$ attaining these approximation constants arise from the convergents $(p_n,q_n)$ of the continued fraction of $α$. Consequently, $k(α)=\limsup_{n\to\infty}|q_n(q_nα-p_n)|^{-1}$. Moreira proved that the function $d(t)=HD(L\cap(-\infty,t))$ where $HD$ denotes Hausdorff dimension, is continuous. Second Lagrange spectra are defined analogously to the classical Lagrange spectrum, but are associated with the problem of approximating an irrational number $α$ by rational numbers $\frac{p}{q}$ that are not convergents of its continued fraction expansion. Two natural definitions arise depending on whether rational multiples $(p,q)=(kp_n,kq_n),k\geq 2$ which represent the same rational numbers as convergents, are allowed or excluded. Based on this distinction, Moshchevitin introduced two second Lagrange spectra, denoted $L_2$ and $L_2^*$. We prove that the function $d_2(t)=HD(L_2\cap (-\infty,t))$ is continuous, whereas $d_2^*(t)=HD(L_2^*\cap (-\infty,t))$ is discontinuous and assumes only the values 0 and 1.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study universal solutions to reflection equations with a spectral parameter, so-called K-operators, within a general framework of universal K-matrices - an extended version of the approach introduced by Appel-Vlaar. Here, the input data is a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra $H$, its comodule algebra $B$ and a pair of consistent twists. In our setting, the universal K-matrix is an element of $B\otimes H$ satisfying certain axioms, and we consider the case $H$ is the quantum loop algebra for $sl_2$, and $B={\cal A}_q$ is the alternating central extension of the $q$-Onsager algebra. Considering tensor products of evaluation representations of $H$ in "non-semisimple" cases, the new set of axioms allows us to introduce and study fused K-operators of spin-$j$; in particular, to prove that for all $j\in\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{N}$ they satisfy the spectral-parameter dependent reflection equation. We provide their explicit expression in terms of elements of the algebra ${\cal A}_q$ for small values of spin-$j$. The precise relation between the fused K-operators of spin-$j$ and evaluations of a universal K-matrix for ${\cal A}_q$ is conjectured based on supporting evidences. We finally discuss implications of our results on the K-operators for quantum integrable systems.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For coprime $p,q\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$, the triplet vertex operator algebra $W_{p,q}$ is a non-simple extension of the universal Virasoro vertex operator algebra of central charge $c_{p,q}=1-\frac{6(p-q)^2}{pq}$, and it is a basic example of a vertex operator algebra appearing in logarithmic conformal field theory. Here, we give a new construction of $W_{p,q}$ different from the original screening operator definition of Feigin-Gainutdinov-Semikhatov-Tipunin. Using our earlier work on the tensor category structure of modules for the Virasoro algebra at central charge $c_{p,q}$, we show that the simple modules appearing in the decomposition of $W_{p,q}$ as a module for the Virasoro algebra have $\mathrm{PSL}_2$-fusion rules and generate a symmetric tensor category equivalent to $\mathrm{Rep}\mathrm{PSL}_2$. Then we use the theory of commutative algebras in braided tensor categories to construct $W_{p,q}$ as an appropriate non-simple modification of the canonical algebra in the Deligne tensor product of $\mathrm{Rep}\mathrm{PSL}_2$ with this Virasoro subcategory. As a consequence, we show that the automorphism group of $W_{p,q}$ is $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$. We also define a braided tensor category $\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ consisting of modules for the Virasoro algebra at central charge $c_{p,q}$ that induce to untwisted modules of $W_{p,q}$. We show that $\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ tensor embeds into the $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-equivariantization of the category of $W_{p,q}$-modules and is closed under contragredient modules. We conjecture that $\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ has enough projective objects and is the correct category of Virasoro modules for constructing logarithmic minimal models in conformal field theory.</p></details>

Evidence for its exhaustiveness includes compatibility with the known generic unitary dual, unramified unitary dual, and low-corank representations. As further support, we verify the conjecture for the unitary dual of the exceptional group of type $G_2$.</p></details>

We give an explicit calculation of the Hochschild complex for diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complexes, and show that the Hochschild complex of $\mathcal{D}$-cap is canonically isomorphic to the de Rham complex of $X$. In particular, we obtain a Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence converging to the Hochschild cohomology groups of $\mathcal{D}$-cap. We obtain explicit formulas relating the Hochschild cohomology and homology of a given diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complex.</p></details>

Regarding the family of sequences, we note that the construction $E_{f,g,h}$ allows for a large variety of sequences by choosing different triples of polynomials. While the detailed analysis of the cross-correlation measure of such a family is a challenging problem and lies beyond the scope of the present paper, the structure of the construction suggests that sequences generated by different polynomials will remain nearly orthogonal. Indeed, since each sequence is built from distinct Legendre symbol sequences with proven low correlation, their combinations are expected to maintain the same level of independence.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a $g$-dimensional abelian variety defined over a number field $F$. It is conjectured that the set of ordinary primes of $A$ over $F$ has positive density, and this is known to be true when $g=1, 2$, or for certain abelian varieties with extra endomorphisms. In this paper, we extend the family of abelian varieties whose sets of ordinary primes have positive density. Specifically, we show that if the endomorphism algebra of $A$ contains a number field $K$ of degree $g$, then under certain conditions on the fields $F$ and $K$, the set of ordinary primes of $A$ over $F$ has positive density. This includes $\mathrm{GL}_2$-type abelian varieties over $\mathbb{Q}$ (resp. quadratic number fields) of dimension $q$ or $2q$ (resp. $q$) for any rational prime $q$. The proof is carried out in the general setting of compatible systems of Galois representations, and as a consequence, it also implies a positive density result for the sets of ordinary primes of certain modular forms of weight $2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X$ be a smooth rigid space with an action of a finite group $G$ satisfying that $X/G$ is represented by a rigid space. We construct sheaves of $p$-adic Cherednik algebras on the small étale site of the quotient $X/G$, and study some of their properties. The sheaves of $p$-adic Cherednik algebras are sheaves of Fréchet-Stein $K$-algebras on $X/G$, which can be regarded as $p$-adic analytic versions of the sheaves of Cherednik algebras associated to the action of a finite group on a smooth algebraic variety defined by P.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Our main objective in this paper is to study the average rank of the $2$-Selmer group of the elliptic curve associated with the $\fracπ{3}$-congruent number problem. Following Heath-Brown's strategy, we could find an asymptotic formula for the size of the relaxed $2$-Selmer groups, which has several consequences towards the average of $2$-Selmer ranks and $\fracπ{3}$-congruent number problem. Indeed, we could find an unconditional positive density of $2$-Selmer rank being $1$ or $3$, among the positive square-free integers $n\equiv 13\pmod{24}$ having all the prime divisors congruent to $1$ modulo $4$ and an unconditional positive density of $2$-Selmer rank being $0$ or $2$, among the positive square-free integers $n\equiv 5\pmod{24}$ having all the prime divisors congruent to $1$ modulo $4$.</p></details>

In the first part, we define the continuous Yang--Mills measure using Markovian holonomy fields, following a construction by Lévy, then we show in the second part how to derive the character expansion of the partition function for any compact structure group from this setting. We continue with two developments obtained in the last few years by Dahlqvist, Lemoine, Lévy and Maïda with similar approaches with respect to the partition function: its large-$N$ asymptotics on all compact surfaces for the structure group $\mathrm{U}(N)$, and its $\frac{1}{N}$ expansion on a torus with an interpretation in terms of random surfaces.</p></details>

> **Comment:** After publication, we learned that the cardinality of $X_3$ was obtained by C. Gurwood (PhD thesis, 1976) by fully characterizing $X(0)$. The result was later reproved by a different method by G. Harcos (undergraduate thesis, 1996, Hungarian). Our method allows the construction of uncountably many irrational numbers in each X(n) with Sturmian continued fraction after substituting a=(2,2), b=(1,1)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $c>0$, let $X_c$ denote the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|<\frac{1}{cq^2}$ has only finitely many rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$. It is a classical fact, known since the 1950s, that $X_c$ is uncountable for $c>3$ and countable for $c<3$. However, the cardinality of $X_3$ does not appear to be present in the literature. We prove that $X_3$ is uncountable. More generally, we show that for any $n\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$, the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ with Lagrange value exactly $3$ and such that $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|<\frac{1}{3q^2}$ has exactly $n$ rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$ is also uncountable.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A recent construction of polylogarithms on Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus in arXiv:2306.08644 is based on a flat connection assembled from single-valued non-holomorphic integration kernels that depend on two points on the Riemann surface. In this work, we construct and prove infinite families of bilinear relations among these integration kernels that are necessary for the closure of the space of higher-genus polylogarithms under integration over the points on the surface. Our bilinear relations generalize the Fay identities among the genus-one Kronecker-Eisenstein kernels to arbitrary genus. The multiple-valued meromorphic kernels in the flat connection of Enriquez are conjectured to obey higher-genus Fay identities of exactly the same form as their single-valued non-holomorphic counterparts. We initiate the applications of Fay identities to derive functional relations among higher-genus polylogarithms involving either single-valued or meromorphic integration kernels.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a metric-dependent geometric variant of factorization homology in conformally flat Riemannian geometry for $d \geq 2$. We introduce a symmetric monoidal category of germs of d-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and orientation-preserving conformal open embeddings, and its full monoidal subcategory generated by flat disks. A conformally flat $d$-disk algebra is a symmetric monoidal functor from this disk category to a target category; in this paper we take the target to be $\mathrm{IndHilb}$, the ind-category of Hilbert spaces, which provides a mathematical formulation of $d$-dimensional conformal field theories. The (1-categorical) left Kan extension of an $\mathrm{IndHilb}$-valued conformally flat $d$-disk algebra defines a metric-dependent invariant of conformally flat manifolds. Under suitable positivity and continuity assumptions, we prove that its value on the standard sphere $(S^d,g_{\mathrm{std}})$ reproduces the sphere partition function of the associated conformal field theory. For $d>2$, we construct nontrivial $\mathrm{IndHilb}$-valued conformally flat $d$-disk algebras from unitary representations of $\mathrm{SO}^+(d,1)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>These are notes from the lectures I gave at the Oberwolfach seminar `Tensor Triangular Geometry and Interactions' which was held in October 2025. The aim of these notes is to give an introduction to tensor triangular geometry, for both small and large categories, through the lens of lattice theory. We do not try to be exhaustive and this is reflected in both the content and the bibliography. For instance we are quite light on triangulated preliminaries, especially for compactly generated categories. The first three sections treat the essentially small case and conclude with a tensor triangular proof of Thomason's theorem computing the spectrum of the perfect complexes on a quasi-compact and quasi-separated scheme. The last section treats the compactly generated case. This final section is somewhat experimental and contains some new thoughts.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Some representation-theoretic multiplicities, such as the Kostka and the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, admit a combinatorial interpretation that places their computation in the complexity class #P. Whether this holds more generally is considered an important open problem in mathematics and computer science, with relevance for geometric complexity theory and quantum information. Recent work has investigated the quantum complexity of particular multiplicities, such as the Kronecker coefficients and certain special cases of the plethysm coefficients. Here, we show that a broad class of representation-theoretic multiplicities is in #BQP. In particular, our result implies that the plethysm coefficients are in #BQP, which was only known in special cases. It also implies all known results on the quantum complexity of previously studied coefficients as special cases, unifying, simplifying, and extending prior work. We obtain our result by multiple applications of the Schur transform. Recent work has improved its dependence on the local dimension, which is crucial for our work. We further describe a general approach for showing that representation-theoretic multiplicities are in #BQP that captures our approach as well as the approaches of prior work. We complement the above by showing that the same multiplicities are also naturally in GapP and obtain polynomial-time classical algorithms when certain parameters are fixed.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the following statement about any Siegel modular form $F$ of degree $n$ and arbitrary odd level $N$ on the group $Γ_{0}^{(n)}(N)$. Let $A(F,T)$ denote the Fourier coefficients of $F$ and write $T=(T(i,j))$. Suppose that $F$ has a non-zero Fourier coefficient $A(F,T_0)$ such that $(T_0(n,n),N)=1$. Then there exist infinitely many odd and square-free (and thus fundamental) integers $m$ such that $m=\mathrm{discriminant}(T)$ and $A(F,T)\neq 0$. In the case of odd degrees, we prove a stronger result by replacing odd and square-free with odd and prime. We also prove quantitative results in this direction. As a consequence, we can show in particular that the statement of the main result in arXiv:2408.03442 about the algebraicity of certain critical values (and the expected functional equation) of the spinor $L$-functions of holomorphic newforms (in the ambit of Deligne's conjectures) on congruence subgroups of $\mathrm{GSp}(3)$ is unconditional.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2015 Zhi-Wei Sun proposed the conjecture that any integer $n > 1$ admits a partition $n = x + y$ with integers $x, y >0$ such that $x + ny$ and $x^2 + ny^2$ are simultaneously prime. To approach this conjecture we use the method of weighted sieve as developed by Richert, Halberstam, and Diamond. In this article, we first formalize the conjecture into a sieve problem. We verify that the conditions required to use Richert's weighted sieve are satisfied and establish partial results with almost-prime solutions for sufficiently large $n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A theorem of R. Travkin and R. Yang, initially conjectured by D. Gaiotto, states that for a generic (not a root of unity) $q$ the category of $q$-twisted D-modules on the affine Grassmannian $Gr_{GL_N}$ which are equivariant with respect to a certain subgroup (defined by a choice of $0 \le M <N$) of $GL_N$ is equivalent to the category of representations of the quantum supergroup $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(M|N))$. We aim to see whether this equivalence should hold when $q$ is a root of unity. We begin by asking if there is a natural bijection between the sets of irreducible objects. In this note we make an observation that suggests this should be the case: we show that there is a natural bijection between irreducible objects in the Gaiotto category and in the category of representations of a supergroup $GL(M|N)$ in positive characteristic. The proof is based on the version of the Serganova's algorithm formulated by J. Brundan and J. Kujawa in arXiv:math/0210108.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study multiple Eisenstein series, which build a natural bridge between the theory of multiple zeta values and modular forms. We prove a large family of relations among these series and propose an explicit conjectural formula for their derivatives. This formula is expressed using the double shuffle structure and the Drop1 operator introduced by Hirose, Maesaka, Seki, and Watanabe. Based on this, we propose a family of linear relations that is conjectured to generate all linear relations among multiple Eisenstein series. Motivated by this conjecture, we introduce a space of formal multiple Eisenstein series and show that it is an $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the problem of certifying (strict) $k$-sign consistency of a matrix, that is, whether all of its $k$-th order minors share the same (strict) sign. Although this problem is generally of combinatorial complexity, we show that for Hankel matrices it can be significantly simplified: our sufficient condition requires checking only the $k$-th order minors of a reshaped Hankel matrix with $k$ rows. Remarkably, when applied to the Hankel operator, this sufficient condition is also necessary. Comparable results were known only in the setting of (strictly) $k$-positive Hankel matrices and operators, in which all minors of order up to $k$ have the same (strict) sign. More concretely, we derive a formula expressing the $k$-th order minors of Hankel matrices as nonnegative integer linear combinations of $k$-th order minors with consecutive row indices. Our derivation uses Schur polynomial theory to show that the $k$-th order minors of any matrix are nonnegative integer linear combinations of row-consecutive $k$-th order minors, meaning minors formed from distinct columns whose consecutive row indices need not coincide across columns. For Hankel matrices, these minors coincide -- up to sign changes arising from column swaps -- with the usual $k$-th order minors with consecutive row indices. Our main result then follows by showing that the sum of certain signed nonnegative integer coefficients equals the corresponding Littlewood--Richardson coefficients. In our problem, the nonnegativity of these coefficients ensures that negatively signed column permutations are cancelled by positively signed ones. Our results also extend naturally to Toeplitz matrices and operators, and we present a partial analogue for circulant matrices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The loop group $G((z^{-1}))$ of a simple complex Lie group $G$ has a natural Poisson structure. We introduce a natural family of Poisson commutative subalgebras $\overline{\mathbf{B}}(C) \subset \mathcal{O}(G((z^{-1}))$ depending on the parameter $C\in G$ called classical universal Bethe subalgebras. To every antidominant cocharacter $μ$ of the maximal torus $T \subset G$ one can associate the closed Poisson subspace $\mathcal{W}_μ$ of $G((z^{-1}))$ (the Poisson algebra $\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{W}_μ)$ is the classical limit of so-called shifted Yangian $Y_μ(\mathfrak{g})$). We consider the images of $\overline{\mathbf{B}}(C)$ in $\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{W}_μ)$, that we denote by $\overline{B}_μ(C)$, that should be considered as classical versions of (not yet defined in general) Bethe subalgebras in shifted Yangians. For regular $C$ centralizing $μ$, we compute the Poincaré series of these subalgebras. For $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{gl}_n$, we define the natural quantization ${\mathbf{Y}}^{\mathrm{rtt}}(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ of $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{Mat}_n((z^{-1}))))$ and universal Bethe subalgebras ${\mathbf{B}}(C) \subset {\mathbf{Y}}^{\mathrm{rtt}}(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$. Using the RTT realization of $Y_μ(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ (invented by Frassek, Pestun, and Tsymbaliuk), we obtain the natural surjections ${\mathbf{Y}}^{\mathrm{rtt}}(\mathfrak{gl}_n) \twoheadrightarrow Y_μ(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ which quantize the embedding $\mathcal{W}_μ\subset \mathrm{Mat}_n((z^{-1}))$). Taking the images of ${\mathbf{B}}(C)$ in $Y_μ(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ we recover Bethe subalgebras $B_μ(C) \subset Y_μ(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ proposed by Frassek, Pestun and Tsymbaliuk.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 81 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1927, Artin and Schreier showed that a field is real closed if and only if its absolute Galois group has order two. Inspired by this characterisation and drawing on earlier work of Neukirch, Pop conjectured the following $p$-adic analogue: a field is $p$-adically closed if and only if its absolute Galois group is isomorphic to that of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. In 1995, the conjecture was independently solved by Efrat for $p \ne 2$ and by Koenigsmann in full generality. Using novel techniques in the theory of valued fields developed over the last 25 years, we give a new elementary and self-contained proof of this theorem, which does not rely on local class field theory and Galois cohomology. We further highlight connections to the recent work of Jahnke-Kartas on perfectoid fields and model-theoretic transfer techniques. We provide a systematic account of all of our methods to encourage further investigations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For each endotrivial complex arising from Bredon homology of a representation sphere, we construct $p$-local quasi-isomorphisms, called forerunners, enabling us to extend Balmer--Gallauer's results in arXiv:2307.04398 Part II concerning the tensor-triangular geometry of permutation modules for elementary abelian $p$-groups to all $p$-groups. We construct an open cover of the Balmer spectrum under which all endotrivials are line bundles, that is, every endotrivial is locally isomorphic to a shifted tensor unit. We define a 'remixed' permutation twisted cohomology ring for which the canonical comparison map from the Balmer spectrum to the homogeneous spectrum of the twisted cohomology ring is injective. If the twisted cohomology ring is Noetherian, the comparison map is an open immersion, and the open cover endows the Balmer spectrum with Dirac scheme structure. We prove Noetherianity holds for Dedekind groups and all $p$-groups of order at most $p^3$, and conjecture Noetherianity holds for all finite $p$-groups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 37 pages. Updated version, to appear in JAMS

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an effective stabilization result for the sheaf cohomology groups of line bundles on flag varieties parametrizing complete flags in k^n, as well as for the sheaf cohomology groups of polynomial functors applied to the cotangent sheaf Omega on projective space. In characteristic zero, these are natural consequences of the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem, but in characteristic p>0 they are non-trivial. Unlike many important contexts in modular representation theory, where the prime characteristic p is assumed to be large relative to n, in our study we fix p and let n go to infinity. We illustrate the general theory by providing explicit stable cohomology calculations in a number of cases of interest. Our examples yield cohomology groups where the number of indecomposable summands has super-polynomial growth, and also show that the cohomological degrees where non-vanishing occurs do not form a connected interval. In the case of polynomial functors of Omega, we prove a Kunneth formula for stable cohomology, and show the invariance of stable cohomology under Frobenius, which combined with the Steinberg tensor product theorem yields calculations of stable cohomology for an interesting class of simple polynomial functors arising in the work of Doty. The results in the special case of symmetric powers of Omega provide a nice application to commutative algebra, yielding a sharp vanishing result for Koszul modules of finite length in all characteristics.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 38 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we define three different notions of tensor products for Leibniz bimodules. The ``natural" tensor product of Leibniz bimodules is not always a Leibniz bimodule. In order to fix this, we introduce the notion of a weak Leibniz bimodule and show that the ``natural" tensor product of weak bimodules is again a weak bimodule. Moreover, it turns out that weak Leibniz bimodules are modules over a cocommutative Hopf algebra canonically associated to the Leibniz algebra. Therefore, the category of all weak Leibniz bimodules is symmetric monoidal and the full subcategory of finite-dimensional weak Leibniz bimodules is rigid and pivotal. On the other hand, we introduce two truncated tensor products of Leibniz bimodules which are again Leibniz bimodules. These tensor products induce a non-associative multiplication on the Grothendieck group of the category of finite-dimensional Leibniz bimodules. In particular, we prove that in characteristic zero for a finite-dimensional solvable Leibniz algebra this Grothendieck ring is an alternative power-associative commutative Jordan ring, but for a finite-dimensional non-zero semi-simple Leibniz algebra it is neither alternative nor a Jordan ring.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent work, we showed that for all $q\in\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}\setminus\mathbb{Z}_{\leq0}$, the sequence $\left\{Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(q\right)\right\}_{n\geq1}$ contains transcendental elements infinitely often. Employing methods from that analysis, we now find that for arbitrary fixed $m\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq1}$, the density of the set of transcendental $Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(m\right)$ for $n\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,N\right\}$ is bounded below by $β_{m}\left(N\right)=\max\left\{ 0,\sqrt{N-1}-3/2\right\}/N$, so that $β_{m}\left(N\right)\asymp N^{-1/2}\rightarrow0$ as $N\rightarrow\infty$. Fixing $n\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq2}$, we further provide a relatively strong upper bound (of $n-1$) on the number of algebraic $Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(m\right)$ for $m\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq1}$, and then show that this result implies that the density of the set of transcendental elements $Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(m\right)$ for $m\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,M\right\}$ has lower bound $β_{n}\left(M\right)=1-\min\left\{ n-1,M\right\}/M$, with $β_{n}\left(M\right)\asymp1-\left(n-1\right)/M\rightarrow1$ as $M\rightarrow\infty$. Finally, we evaluate the bivariate density of the set of transcendental $Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(m\right)$ for $\left(n,m\right)\in\left\{2,3,\ldots,N\right\}\times\left\{1,2,\ldots,M\right\}$, obtaining the lower bound $β\left(N,M\right)=\left(M-1\right)/\left[2\left(N-1\right)\right]$ if $M\leq N-1$, $=1-N/\left(2M\right)$ if $M>N-1$, which converges to 0 for $M/N\rightarrow0$, to 1/2 for $M/N\rightarrow1$, and to 1 for $M/N\rightarrow\infty$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate bi-periodic Padovan and bi-periodic Perrin quaternions over the quaternion algebra Q_Zp. We introduce the bi-periodic Perrin sequence and clarify its structural relationship with the bi-periodic Padovan sequence. By extending these sequences to the quaternion setting, we analyze their norm properties in the modular framework. For suitable choices of twin prime coefficients, we derive explicit criteria characterizing zero divisors and invertible elements in Q_Zp.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2024, Garvan, Sellers and Smoot discovered a remarkable symmetry in the families of congruences for generalized Frobenius partitions $cψ_{2,0}$ and $cψ_{2,1}$. They also emphasized that the considerations for the general case of $cψ_{k,β}$ are important for future work. In this paper, for each $k$ we construct a vector-valued modular form for the generating functions of $cψ_{k,β}$, and determine an equivalence relation among all $β$. Within each equivalence class, we can identify modular transformations relating the congruences of one $cψ_{k,β}$ to that of another $cψ_{k,β'}$. Furthermore, correspondences between different equivalence classes can also be obtained through linear combinations of modular transformations. As an example, with the aid of these correspondences, we prove a family of congruences of $cφ_{3}$, the Andrews' $3$-colored Frobenius partition.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the representations of the triplet group $L_n$, where $n$ is a positive integer, and its extensions to the virtual and welded triplet groups $VL_n$ and $WL_n$, respectively. We first introduce $L_n$, its extensions, and its pure subgroup. We then investigate several representations, proving the irreducibility of the classical Tits representation $Θ: L_n \to \mathrm{GL}_{n-1}(\mathbb{C})$ over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ and constructing a new representation $μ: L_n \to \mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{F}_n)$, where $\mathbb{F}_n$ is the free group of rank $n$. For the representation $μ$, we determine its matrix form, faithfulness, and irreducibility. We also classify all complex homogeneous $2$-local representations of $L_n$ for $n \ge 3$ and all non-homogeneous $2$-local representations of $L_3$, establishing connections with the complex specialization of the representation $μ$. Finally, we examine extensions of $L_n$ representations to $VL_n$ and $WL_n$, proving their existence, classifying non-trivial complex homogeneous $2$-local representations, and analyzing their faithfulness and irreducibility. The paper concludes with an open question regarding further extension of representation of $L_n$ to $VL_n$ and $WL_n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we generalize the special subset of the Markov-Lagrange spectrum (and the Markov spectrum) called the discrete Markov spectrum. The discrete Markov spectrum is defined in terms of the Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz.$ Using the tool called snake graphs, originating from cluster algebra theory, we first reconstruct proofs of its properties in a combinatorial framework and then extend it to the generalized setting. We then introduce the generalized discrete Markov spectrum, defined analogously via the generalized Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k_1 yz + k_2 zx + k_3 xy = (3 + k_1 + k_2 + k_3) xyz.$ We prove that this generalized spectrum is contained in the Markov-Lagrange spectrum and thus the Markov spectrum.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using the WZ method to prove supercongruences critically depends on an inspired WZ pair choice. This paper demonstrates a procedure for finding WZ pair candidates to prove a given supercongruence. When suitable WZ pairs are thus obtained, coupling them with the $p$-adic approximation of $Γ_p$ by Long and Ramakrishna enables uniform proofs for the Van Hamme supercongruences (B.2), (C.2), (D.2), (E.2), (F.2), (G.2), and (H.2). This approach also yields the known extensions of G.2 modulo $p^4$, and of H.2 modulo $p^3$ when $p$ is $3$ modulo $4$. Finally, the Van Hamme supercongruence (I.2) is shown to be a special case of the WZ method where Gosper's algorithm itself succeeds.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For the $n$th cyclotomic polynomial $Φ_n$, let $A(n)$ denote the greatest absolute value of its coefficients, its height, and let $D(n)$ denote the difference between its largest and smallest coefficients, its diameter. We show that for any odd prime $p$ and an integer $h$ in the range $1\le h\le(p+1)/2$, there are arbitrarily large primes $q$ and $r$ such that $Φ_{pqr}$ has the height $h$. This certainly answers the question of whether every natural number occurs as the height of some cyclotomic polynomial. Our construction specifies explicit choices of $q$ and $r$ with $A(pqr)=h$, and for these choices $D(pqr)$ has one of two values: it is either $2h$ or $2h-1$, depending on the congruence class of $h$ modulo $p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-p})$ be a quadratic field for an odd prime $p$. We show that there exist infinitely many primes $p$ for which no elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ has torsion subgroup $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}/2N\mathbb{Z}$ over $K$ for $N=5,6$. We also prove that there exist infinitely many primes $p$ for which there are infinitely many elliptic curves $E/\mathbb{Q}$ with this torsion structure, conditional on the parity conjecture. Using these results, we obtain new torsion classification results over Kummer extensions of cyclotomic fields and over composites of $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of number fields, refining and extending our previous work.</p></details>

This property was already proved by M. Duflo for Lie algebras in any characteristic under more restrictive finiteness conditions. It was then generalized to Lie superalgebras in characteristic 0 in previous works of the author. In a second part of the article, we study the links between coinduced representations and induced representations in the case of restricted Lie superalgebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the Newton polygons and Ekedahl-Oort types of reductions of abelian covers of the projective line branched at three points modulo a prime. We study the natural density of primes where these covers give supersingular and superspecial curves and show they appear much more often than expected. We also show that unlikely Newton polygons and Ekedahl-Oort types in the moduli space of curves appear frequently. Finally, we prove a theorem that provides evidence of Oort's Conjecture about Newton polygons in certain cases and gives new constructions of supersingular curves.</p></details>
