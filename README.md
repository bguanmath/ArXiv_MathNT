 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Miltiadis Karakikes, Sotiris Karanikolopoulos, Aristides Kontogeorgis, Dimitrios Noulas &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a unified group-theoretic framework bridging the arithmetic homotopy exact sequence of a variety and the Birman exact sequence of a surface. Within this framework, we reinterpret classical arithmetic notions - such as the descent of varieties and of covers - and construct their topological analogues. We formalize the parallel setting between closed subgroups of the absolute Galois group and subgroups of the Mapping Class Group of a base space and their actions on fundamental groups. This provides an analogy between arithmetic and topological invariants, allowing us to define the groups of moduli, definition, and invariance in both settings. Using this unified perspective, some purely group-theoretic proofs provide results in both settings simultaneously. Applications include a topological analogue of Weil's Descent Theorem for mapping class groups and an adaptation of Débes and Douai's cohomological obstructions regarding descent of algebraic covers to the topological setting. Finally, we elevate these results to the categorical level. We demonstrate that the classical Weil cocycle condition is equivalent to the existence of a linearization in the language of equivariant categories. Applying this perspective to the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves $\mathsf{D^b}(X)$, we show that the equivariant derived category $\mathsf{D^b}(X)^G$, under the action induced by a Weil descent datum, recovers the derived category of the descended variety.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yerko Torres-Nova &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study reciprocity formulas for Dedekind sums associated with absolutely continuous functions, extending the classical Dedekind-Rademacher reciprocity formula. In particular, we treat the case of periodic Bernoulli functions. Our approach generalizes an integral method and uses Fourier analysis to show that the reciprocity for polynomial-type functions admits a geometric interpretation in terms of conical zeta values.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $α\in \mathbb{R}$, let $$G_α:= \left< \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} , \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ α& 1 \end{bmatrix} \right> < \mathrm{SL}_2 (\mathbb{R}).$$ K. Kim and the first author established the orbit test, which provides a sufficient condition for $G_α$ not to be a rank-$2$ free group. In this article, we present two main applications of the orbit test. First, using the corresponding modulo homomorphism, we show that the converse of the orbit test does not hold. In particular, we construct explicit counterexamples, all of which are rational. As another application, we construct sequences of non-free rational numbers converging to $3$. These sequences are given by $$ 3 + \frac{3}{2 (9 n - 1)} \quad \text{and} \quad 3 + \frac{9 n + 5}{3 (2 n + 1) (9 n + 4)},$$ and their construction relies on the orbit test together with a modified Pell's equation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We let $f$ be a half-integral weight modular form of weight $κ>4$ on $Γ_0(4)$ that is an eigenfunction of all Hecke operators $T_n$, so that $T_nf = Λ_f(n)n^{\frac{κ-1}{2}}f$. Let $\|f\|$ denote the Petersson norm of $f$. We study a weighted second moment of the central value of the $L$-function associated to $f$ over an orthogonal basis $H_κ(4)$ of $S_κ(Γ_0(4))$. This corresponds to studying the following sum: $$\sum_{f\in H_κ(4)}\frac{Λ_f(n)\vert L(1/2,f)\vert^2}{\|f\|^2}.$$ Using the relative trace formula, we obtain an asymptotic formula for the second moment. We then use the method of amplification to get the subconvexity bound $$L(1/2,f)\ll_{\varepsilon} (κ^2)^{\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{40}+\varepsilon}.$$ This is the first subconvexity result for half-integral weight modular forms in the weight aspect. We also apply our second moment result to get a quantitative simultaneous non-vanishing result for central values of $L$-functions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Wan Keng Cheong, Ngau Lam &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Title changed; Results on unitarizable modules over classical Lie algebras added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{g}$ denote the classical Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_d$, $\mathfrak{sp}_{2d}$, or $\mathfrak{so}_{2d}$ with a fixed $*$-structure $σ$. Let $M_1, \ldots, M_\ell$ be unitarizable $\mathfrak{g}$-modules (with respect to $σ$), and let ${\bf z}=(z_1, \ldots, z_\ell) \in \mathbb{C}^\ell$. We investigate the action of the Bethe algebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathfrak{g}}^μ$ for $\mathfrak{g}$ with respect to $μ\in \mathfrak{g}^*$ on the tensor product $\underline{M}({\bf z}):=M_1(z_1) \otimes \cdots \otimes M_\ell(z_\ell)$ of evaluation $\mathfrak{g}[t]$-modules. We show that if $μ\circ σ$ equals the complex conjugation of $μ$, then $\mathcal{B}_{\mathfrak{g}}^μ$ is diagonalizable on any finite-dimensional $\mathcal{B}_{\mathfrak{g}}^μ$-submodule of $\underline{M}({\bf z})$ for ${\bf z} \in \mathbb{R}^\ell$. This, together with the result derived from the duality of Bethe algebras (see below), suggests that a simple spectrum conjecture for $\mathcal{B}_{\mathfrak{g}}^μ$ should hold. We establish a duality of Bethe algebras for the general linear Lie (super)algebras $\mathfrak{gl}_d$ and $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$. As an application, we show that under a generic condition, the Bethe algebra for $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$ with respect to ${\bf z} \in \mathbb{C}^{p+q+m+n}$ is diagonalizable with a simple spectrum on any weight space of $L_1(w_1) \otimes \cdots \otimes L_d(w_d)$, where the $L_i$ are (infinite-dimensional) unitarizable highest weight $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$-modules corresponding to generalized partitions of depth 1, and $w_1, \ldots, w_d \in \mathbb{C}$. We also obtain the corresponding result for $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m}$ by setting $q=n=0$.</p></details>

We provide an explicit and purely combinatorial description of the $m$-colored quivers that arise within the $m$-colored mutation class of a quiver of type $\mathbb{\widetilde{A}}$. Our results generalize and extend existing work, specifically recovering a description by Bastian [1] when the case $m=1$ is considered.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00104v2'>1901.00104</a>\]&nbsp; **On polyhedral formulas for Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Chul-hee Lee &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 18 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a method to prove a polyhedral branching formula for Kirillov-Reshetikhin (KR) modules over a quantum affine algebra. When the underlying simple Lie algebra is of exceptional type, such a formula remains conjectural in many cases. Using a linear recurrence relation satisfied by the characters of KR modules, we convert the verification of a polyhedral formula into an identity between two rational functions of a single variable with only simple poles at known locations. It is then sufficient to compare the residues at those poles, which are explicitly computable quantities. By applying this strategy, we obtain new, computer-assisted and easily verifiable proofs of known polyhedral formulas in types $F_4$ and $G_2$ within a uniform framework.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 37 pages; comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove finiteness and give an explicit upper bound on the number of $S$-integral points on affine curves satisfying a certain rank-genus inequality. We achieve this by developing an analogue of the Chabauty method, embedding the curve into its generalised Jacobian and bounding the Abel-Jacobi image of the $S$-integral points using arithmetic intersection theory. Our results also provide the foundations for a computational method to determine the set of $S$-integral points on affine curves which will be presented in a follow-up article.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 35 Pages. Substantially expanded and completely revised version. To appear in The Ramanujan Journal

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a given elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$, let $N_p(E)$ be the number of points on $E$ modulo $p$ for a prime of good reduction for $E$. Given integer $n$, let $G_k(E,n)$ be the number of $k$-tuples of $p_1<p_2<\ldots <p_k$ primes of good reduction for $E$, for which the equation in the title holds, then on assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for elliptic curves without CM (and unconditionally if the curves have complex multiplication), I show that $\varlimsup_{n\to\infty} G_k(E,n)=\infty$ for any integer $k\geq 3$. I conjecture that this result also holds for $k=1,2$ i.e. this conjecture says that there are arbitrarily long ``elliptic progressions of primes'' i.e. sequences of primes $p_1<p_2<\cdots <p_m$ of arbitrary lengths $m$ such that $N_{p_1}(E)=N_{p_2}(E)=\cdots =N_{p_m}(E)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a letter from Tate to Serre dated March 26, 1974, Tate suggested a classification of weight one modular forms of prime level in terms of their associated odd Artin representations. This paper carries out an analogous classification of Maass wave forms of prime power level in terms of complex even representations. The parameters are identified with techniques from class field theory and Galois representations. The classification reveals that there exist distinct Maass cusp forms of tetrahedral type on $Γ_1(\ell)$ that remain inequivalent modulo $3$ for $\ell = 7687, 16363$ and $20887$, and that these $\ell$ are the three smallest such primes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Sylvester showed that the partition function can be written as a sum of the polynomial term and quasiperiodic components called the Sylvester waves. Recently an explicit expression of the Sylvester wave as a finite sum over the Bernoulli polynomials of higher order with periodic coefficients was found. This expression can be also written as the weighted sum of the polynomial terms with shifted arguments and this manuscript presents a formal proof for validity of such representation.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 47 pages; revised version following referee reports, comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the algebraic Picard group of the category of $K(n)$-local spectra, for all heights $n$ and all primes $p$. In particular, we show that it is always finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and, whenever $n \geq 2$, is of rank $2$, thereby confirming a prediction made by Hopkins in the early 1990s. In fact, with the exception of the anomalous case $n=p=2$, we provide a full set of topological generators for these groups. Our arguments rely on recent advances in $p$-adic geometry to translate the problem to a computation on Drinfeld's symmetric space, which can then be solved using results of Colmez--Dospinescu--Niziol.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages, to appear in European Journal of Combinatorics

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The $(P, w)$-partition generating function $K_{(P,w)}(x)$ is a quasisymmetric function obtained from a labeled poset. Recently, Liu and Weselcouch gave a formula for the coefficients of $K_{(P,w)}(x)$ when expanded in the quasisymmetric power sum function basis. This formula generalizes the classical Murnaghan--Nakayama rule for Schur functions. We extend this result to weighted $(P, w)$-partitions and provide a short combinatorial proof, avoiding the Hopf algebra machinery used by Liu--Weselcouch.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 24 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Diophantine equation of type $U_n(x)=V_m(y)$, where $(U_n)_{n\geq 0}$ and $(V_m)_{m\geq 0}$ are polynomial power sums defined over a number field $K$. By applying the finiteness criterion of Bilu and Tichy, we show under appropriate assumptions that equation $U_n(x)=V_m(y)$ has infinitely many solutions with bounded $\mathcal{O}_S$-denominator. We also study decomposable polynomials in third and second order linear recurrence sequences. In particular, we show that if $W_n(x)=g(h(x))$ for a simple third order linear recurrence sequence $(W_n(x))_{n\geq 0}$ of complex polynomials, then deg $g$ is bounded. Furthermore, we show that if $(u_{n_1}+u_{n_2})(x)=g(h(x))$ for a binary recurrence sequence $(u_n(x))_{n\geq 0}$ then deg $g$ is bounded.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be an affinoid integral domain over a non-Archimedean field $K$, and let $L$ be its field of fractions. We prove that the normalization of $A$ can be reconstructed from $L$ by taking the intersection of all maximal discrete valuation subrings. As a corollary, taking the field of fractions induces a fully faithful functor from the category of normal affinoid integral domains over $K$ to the category of field extensions of $K$. This provides another $p$-adic analogue of the Riemann Hebbarkeitssatz.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 14 Pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we obtain several new factorization results for certain classes of polynomials having integer coefficients. In doing so, we use the information about prime factorization of the value taken up by such polynomials and their higher order formal derivatives at sufficiently large integer arguments. If a lower bound for the minimum possible degree of a factor of such a polynomial is known a priori, then the integer argument becomes significantly smaller, which makes the underlying factorization result easier to apply. A result on explicit lower degree factor bound for the classes of polynomials considered in this paper is also proved via Newton polygons.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Hardy function $Z(t)=ζ(1/2+it)e^{iθ(t)}$ takes real values for real $t$ and its real zeros are zeros $ζ(s)$ on the critical line $1/2+it$. After discovering the critical value of the local maximum in 1956, Lehmer formulated the assumption that the Hardy function could have a negative local maximum or a positive local minimum. In the paper the Generalized Hardy function is defined as the real part of the Hardy function on any line $α_ν+it$ parallel to the critical line $1/2+it$ $$Z_{α_ν}(t)=Re\ ζ(α_ν+it)e^{iθ(t)}$$ and established an distinct relationship between the zeros of the $\cosθ(t)$ function and the zeros of the Generalized Hardy function. $$\forall ΔT_λ=(t_λ, t_{λ+1}],\ t_λ=2πλ^2,\ λ=1,\ 2,\ 3\ ...$$ $$\exists A_λ:\forall \hatα_λ>A_λ$$ $$|\cosθ(t) -Z_{\hatα_λ}(t)|<ε(A_λ),\ t\in ΔT_λ$$ Then the binomial series is used to establish a relationship between the values of the Generalized Hardy function on any two lines $α_ν+it$ and $α_{ν+1}+it$ parallel to the critical line. Thus, by induction between values $σ=1/2$ and $σ=\hatα_λ>A_λ$ $$α^{(λ)}_1<α^{(λ)}_2<α^{(λ)}_3<...<α^{(λ)}_ν<...<α^{(λ)}_{μ_λ}$$ an distinct relationship has been established between the zeros of the function $\cosθ(t)$ and the zeros of the Hardy function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Inspired by the study of vertex operator algebra extensions, we answer the question of when the category of local modules over a commutative exact algebra in a braided finite tensor category is a (non-semisimple) modular tensor category. Along the way we provide sufficient conditions for the category of local modules to be rigid, pivotal and ribbon. We also discuss two ways to construct such commutative exact algebras. The first is the class of simple current algebras and the second is using right adjoints of central tensor functors. Furthermore, we discuss Witt equivalence and its relation with extensions of VOAs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the proof of Crew's parabolicity conjecture, we established a key property concerning the slopes of $\dagger$-hulls of $F$-isocrystals, extending a result of Tsuzuki. This article presents an alternative proof of this theorem for a specific class of $F$-isocrystals. The central ingredient is a local extension property for étale $p$-divisible subgroups. To relate $p$-divisible groups and overconvergent $F$-isocrystals, we employ logarithmic Dieudonné theory, as introduced by Kato and further developed by Inoue. Over curves, this leads to an equivalence between the category of potentially semi-stable $p$-divisible groups and overconvergent $F$-isocrystals with slopes in the interval $[0,1]$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper introduces a degenerate version of the Euler-Seidel method by incorporating a parameter lambda into the classical recurrence relation. We define a degenerate Euler-Seidel matrix associated with an initial sequence and establish corresponding lambda-generalized binomial identities and generating function relations. By applying this method to the degenerate Bernoulli, Euler, and Genocchi polynomials, we derive several new combinatorial identities. This work extends the classical Euler-Seidel method to the domain of degenerate special polynomials and numbers, providing a new framework for studying their properties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the one-level density of zeros for a family of $Γ_1(q)$ $L$-functions. Assuming GRH, we are able to extend the support of the Fourier transform of the test function to $\left(-\frac{8}{3},\frac{8}{3}\right)$ and verify the Katz-Sarnak prediction for our unitary family. As an application, we obtain that the proportion of forms in the family with non-vanishing at the central point is at least $62.5\%$, assuming GRH. This is the highest non-vanishing proportion for any family associated with a unitary group. Moreover, this result indicates that the structural properties of $L$-functions play a more important role in extending the support than the associated symmetry group.</p></details>

Define $$ f_k(N):=\max\left\{\sum_{a\in A}\frac1a: A\subseteq [N] \text{ is LCM-$k$-free}\right\}. $$ Addressing a problem of Erdős, we prove an explicit unconditional lower bound $$ f_k(N)\ge (\log N)^{c_k-o(1)}, \qquad c_k:=\frac{k-2}{e((k-2)!)^{1/(k-2)}}. $$ Let $F_k(n)$ denote the maximum size of a $k$-sunflower-free family of subsets of $[n]$, and define the Erdős--Szemerédi $k$-sunflower-free capacity by $μ_k^{\mathrm S}:=\limsup_{n\to\infty}F_k(n)^{1/n}$. Motivated by a remark of Erdős relating this problem to the sunflower conjecture, we show that $$ (\log N)^{\logμ_k^{\mathrm S}-o(1)} \le f_k(N) \ll (\log N)^{μ_k^{\mathrm S}-1+o(1)}. $$ Furthermore, we show that the Erdős--Szemerédi sunflower conjecture fails for this fixed $k$ (i.e. $μ_k^{\mathrm S}=2$) if and only if $f_k(N)=(\log N)^{1-o(1)}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For finite-dimensional algebras over algebraically closed fields, we consider two fundamental classes of modules and their geometric counterparts: bricks and $τ$-rigid modules, as well as brick components and $τ$-regular components. We then apply our results in the study of some open conjectures. First, we investigate the situation where every brick is $τ$-rigid. We prove that this occurs exactly when the algebra is locally representation-directed; a family of algebras introduced by Dräxler in the 1990s, which are always representation-finite. Then, we adopt a geometric perspective and analyze the brick and $τ$-regular components of module varieties. In this greater generality, we establish new properties of such components. Inspired by some recent conjectures, we apply our results to the study of minimal brick-infinite algebras. Along the way, we construct some limits of rigid $g$-vectors, under a condition that we call the $τ$-convergence property. This construction is novel and, in certain cases, yields an integral $g$-vector lying outside the $τ$-tilting fan (a.k.a. $g$-vector fan). We show how our results provide new tools to the study of some open conjectures and particularly illustrate that for $E$-tame algebras.</p></details>

They generalize fractionally Calabi-Yau algebras and categorify de la Peña's algebras of cyclotomic type. Path algebras of affine type and (higher) canonical algebras are examples of Serre cyclotomic algebras. Our definition is related to Elias-Hogancamp's theory of categorical diagonalization. We compute the categorical entropy of their Serre functors, in the sense of Dimitrov-Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich, and use this to determine which graded path algebras and which homologically smooth graded gentle algebras are Serre cyclotomic. Finally, we show that trivial extension algebras of Serre cyclotomic algebras have finite global complexity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The algebraic notion of a pivotal module category was developed by Schaumann and Shimizu and is central to the description of boundary conditions in conformal field theory according to a proposal by Fuchs and Schweigert. In this paper, we present a large class of examples of pivotal module categories of topological origin: For a unimodular finite ribbon category $\mathcal{A}$, we prove that the factorization homology $\int_Σ\mathcal{A}$ of a compact oriented surface $Σ$ with $n$ marked boundary intervals, at least one per connected component, comes with the structure of a pivotal module category over $\mathcal{A}^{\boxtimes n}$. This endows the internal skein algebras of Ben-Zvi-Brochier-Jordan, in particular the elliptic double, with a symmetric Frobenius structure. As application, we obtain, for each choice of $\mathcal{A}$, a family of full open conformal field theories, each of which comes with correlation functions for all surfaces with marked boundary intervals that are explicitly computable using factorization homology. As a further application, we explain how modified traces can be 'integrated' over surfaces: We show that the modified trace for $\mathcal{A}$ extends in a canonical way to the factorization homology of $Σ$. The resulting traces have the remarkable property of being modular invariant, i.e. fixed by the mapping class group action.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The {\em Prym} of a cyclic covering of smooth projective curves is the ``new'' part of the Jacobian: the quotient of the Jacobian of the covering curve by the Jacobians of the intermediate covers. Given a family of such coverings, the fundamental group of the base of the family acts on the Tate modules of the Pryms, and the image of this representation is a key ingredient in answering arithmetic statistics questions about the distribution of the group structure of the $L$-torsion of a random Prym in the family. (Over ${\mathbb{F}}_q$, the action of Frobenius is roughly uniformly distributed over the {\em arithmetic} monodromy, a coset of the image of the fundamental group of the base change to $\bar{\mathbb{F}}_q$ (the {\em geometric} monodromy).) In the present note, we show for a number of natural families that (with limited exceptions) the geometric monodromy is sandwiched between a certain unitary group and its derived subgroup. In particular, this holds for the one-parameter families obtained by starting with any fixed cover and varying one (tame) ramification point. As an application, we deduce analogous largeness results for the monodromy of the Selmer groups of elliptic surfaces with $j=0$ or $j=1728$, by relating them to cyclic covers of degree 6 or 4 respectively, implying that their Selmer groups do not satisfy the standard heuristics. For instance, for eliptic surfaces with $j=0$ of sufficiently large height over ${\mathbb{P}}^1_{\mathbb{F}_q}$, the average size of the $l$-Selmer group is $l+3+o_q(1)$ when $l$ (fixed) and $q$ (large) are both 1 mod 3, compared to $l+1+o_q(1)$ for general elliptic surfaces.</p></details>

As an application, we determine the range of branch degrees for which Ulrich line bundles could exist, and we show that every even bidouble plane carries a special rank-two Ulrich bundle. Our method combines the invariant-theoretic decomposition of $H^2(S,\mathbb{Q})$ under the Galois group with cohomological criteria for Ulrich bundles.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Since the time of Minkowski a basic problem in number theory has been to find lower bounds for the absolute value $Δ(K)$ of the discriminant of a number field $K$ in terms of the degree $n(K)$ of $K$. In this paper we study another measure of the size of $K$ given by the covering radius $μ(K)$ of the ring of integers $O_K$ of $K$. Here $μ(K)$ is the $L^2$ radius $||V_2(K)||_2$ of the $L^2$ Voronoi cell $V_2(K)$ of $O_K$, where $V_2(K)$ is the set of points in $\mathbb{R} \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}} K$ that are at least as close to the origin as they are to any non-zero element of $O_K$. To put a limit on what lower bounds one can prove for $μ(K)$ in terms of $n(K)$, we study infinite families of $K$ of increasing degree for which $μ(K)$ can be bounded above by an explicit power of $n(K)$. We also study analogous questions when the $L^2$ norm is replaced by the $L^\infty$ norm.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There are three universal $2$-parameter vertex algebras $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$, $\mathcal{W}^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$, and $\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ which are freely generated of types $\mathcal{W}(2,3,4,\dots)$, $\mathcal{W}(2,4,6,\dots)$, and $\mathcal{W}(1^3, 2, 3^3, 4,\dots)$, respectively. They serve as classifying objects for vertex algebras with these generating types satisfying mild hypotheses. Their $1$-parameter quotients are expected to be the building blocks of all $\mathcal{W}$-algebras of classical Lie types. Furthermore, such $\mathcal{W}$-algebras are expected to be organized into families that are governed by new universal $2$-parameter vertex algebras, which are themselves glueings of copies of $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$ in type $A$ (together with a Heisenberg algebra), and copies of $\mathcal{W}^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$ and $\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ in types $B$, $C$, and $D$. We denote these universal objects by $\mathcal{W}^{X,S,M}_{\infty}$, where $X$ denotes the Lie type (either $A$, $C$, or $BD$ since types $B$ and $D$ can be treated uniformly), and $S$, $M$ are sets of positive integers that determine certain families of partitions. More precisely, for a partition $P = (n_0^{m_0}, n_1^{m_1},\dots, n_{t}^{m_t})$ of $N = \sum_{i=0}^t n_i m_i$ consisting of $m_i$ parts of size $n_i$, where $n_0> n_1 > \cdots > n_t \geq 2$, $M = \{m_0,\dots, m_t\}$ is the set of multiplicities, and $S = \{d_1,\dots, d_t\}$ is the set of height differences $d_{i+1} = n_i - n_{i+1}$. After introducing this general conjectural picture, we will construct the first nontrivial example $\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{so}_2}_{\infty}:=\mathcal{W}^{BD, \emptyset, \{2\}}_{\infty}$, which is a glueing of two copies of $\mathcal{W}^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We analyze finite orbits of the natural braid group action on the character variety of the $n$ times punctured sphere. Building on recent results relating middle convolution and finite complex reflection groups, our work implements Katz's middle convolution to explicitly classify finite orbits in the $SL_2(\C)$-character variety of the punctured sphere. We provide theoretical results on the existence of finite orbits arising from the imprimitive finite complex reflection groups and formulas for constructing such examples when they exist. In the primitive finite complex reflection groups, we perform an exhaustive search and provide computational results. Our contributions also include Magma computer code for middle convolution and for computing the orbit under this action when it is known to be finite.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we consider relational structures arising from Comer's finite field construction, where the cosets need not be sum free. These Comer schemes generalize the notion of a Ramsey scheme and may be of independent interest. As an application, we give the first finite representation of $34_{65}$. This leaves $33_{65}$ as the only remaining relation algebra in the family $N_{65}$ with a flexible atom that is not known to be finitely representable. Motivated by this, we complement our upper bounds with some lower bounds. Using a SAT solver, we show that $33_{65}$ is not finitely representable on fewer than $24$ points, and that $33_{65}$ does not admit a cyclic group representation on fewer than $120$ points. We also employ a SAT solver to show that $34_{65}$ is not representable on fewer than $24$ points.</p></details>

In every dimension, this bound is nontrivial for sums over boxes with side lengths as short as $p^{1/4 + κ}$ for any $κ>0$. Our methods capitalize on the relationship between characters mod $p$ and characters over finite field extensions as well as bounds on the multiplicative energy of sets in products of finite fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a perfect ring of characteristic $p>0$, and let $R$ be an animated $k$-algebra. This note aims to show that the Nygaard filtered prismatization $R^{\mathrm{Nyg}}$ of $R$ is naturally isomorphic, as a stack over $k^{\mathrm{Nyg}}$, to the relative spectrum over $k^{\mathrm{Nyg}}$ of the Rees algebra of the Nygaard filtered prismatic cohomology of $R$ relative to $k$. In doing so, we axiomatise the functorial affineness property displayed by the relative Nygaard filtered prismatization, and dub it de Rham affineness after the fundamental example of the functor sending an animated ring to its relative de Rham stack. While we treat this concept as an organising tool for the author's forthcoming work on the syntomification of Frobenius liftable schemes, we are able to frame some questions based on a structural theorem of independent interest: a functor to stacks which is de Rham affine often arises via ring stacks through transmutation.</p></details>

Specializing to algebras given by (not necessarily finite) quivers with relations, we further investigate when the categories of finitely presented modules, finitely copresented modules and finite dimensional modules have almost split sequences on either or both sides.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 47 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A problem raised by Cuadra and Simson in 2007 asks whether any locally finitely presented Grothendieck category with enough flat objects also has enough projectives. In this paper, we start from a key observation: a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category has enough flat objects if, and only if, it has exact products. This enables several equivalent reformulations of the problem, allowing us to identify a counterexample (thus providing a negative solution to the problem), while also connecting it to a classical ring-theoretical question posed by Miller in 1975, and even to the Telescope Conjecture for compactly generated triangulated categories. Moreover, we describe several classes of Grothendieck categories where the problem can be answered affirmatively. For example, we show that a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category whose category of finitely presented objects is Krull--Schmidt has enough flats if, and only if, it is generated by a family of finitely generated projectives.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define several versions of a class of varieties $X_{\mathfrak{g}}$ attached to a complex reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, generalizing the Hilbert scheme of points on the plane. These include trigonometric and elliptic versions attached to the corresponding groups. We also define the corresponding isospectral varieties $Y_{\mathfrak{g}}$. We prove a Gordon-Stafford localization theorem for $X_{\mathfrak{g}}$ and the corresponding equal-parameter rational Cherednik algebras, relate these varieties to the affine Springer fiber-sheaf correspondence of arXiv:2204.00303, and discuss examples. We conjecture that the torus-fixed points of our varieties are in bijection with two-sided cells in the finite Weyl group and prove this in types $ABC$. We relate these results to known results about Calogero-Moser spaces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the shrinking target and recurrence set associated to non-autonomous measure-preserving systems on compact metric spaces, establishing zero-one criteria in the spirit of classical Borel-Cantelli results. Our first main theorem gives a quantitative shrinking target result for non-autonomous systems under a uniform mixing condition, providing asymptotics with an optimal error term. This general result is applicable to certain families of inner functions, yielding concrete applications such as patterns of zeros in the multibase expansion. Turning to recurrence, we establish new zero-measure laws for non-autonomous systems. In the autonomous case, we prove a zero-one criterion for recurrence sets of centred, one-component inner functions via Markov partitions and distortion estimates. Together, these results provide a unified framework for shrinking target and recurrence problems in both autonomous and non-autonomous dynamics.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a deterministic algorithm based on Coppersmith's method that employs a rank-3 lattice to address factoring-related problems. An interesting aspect of our approach is that we utilize the second vector in the LLL-reduced basis to avoid trivial collisions in the Baby-step Giant-step method, rather than the shortest vector as is commonly used in the literature. Our results are as follows: 1. Compared to the result by Harvey and Hittmeir (Math. Comp. 91 (2022), 1367 - 1379), who achieved a complexity of O( N^(1/5) log^(16/5) N / (log log N)^(3/5)) for factoring a semiprime N = pq, we demonstrate that in the balanced p and q case, the complexity can be improved to O( N^(1/5) log^(13/5) N / (log log N)^(3/5) ). 2. For factoring sums and differences of powers, that is, numbers of the form N = a^n plus or minus b^n, we improve Hittmeir's result (Math. Comp. 86 (2017), 2947 - 2954) from O( N^(1/4) log^(3/2) N ) to O( N^(1/5) log^(13/5) N ). 3. For the problem of finding r-power divisors, that is, finding all integers p such that p^r divides N, Harvey and Hittmeir (Proceedings of ANTS XV, Research in Number Theory 8 (2022), no. 4, Paper No. 94) recently directly applied Coppersmith's method and achieved a complexity of O( N^(1/(4r)) log^(10+epsilon) N / r^3 ). By using faster LLL-type algorithms and sieving on small primes, we improve their result to O( N^(1/(4r)) log^(7+3 epsilon) N / ((log log N minus log(4r)) r^(2+epsilon)) ). The worst-case running time for their algorithm occurs when N = p^r q with q on the order of N^(1/2). By focusing on this case and employing our rank-3 lattice approach, we achieve a complexity of O( r^(1/4) N^(1/(4r)) log^(5/2) N ). In conclusion, we offer a new perspective on these problems, which we hope will provide further insights.</p></details>

This article provide a uniform description of the sets of Weyl group elements (which we refer to as Brion atoms) indexing the terms in this formula. This builds on prior work addressing types A, B, and C. The main novelty of our results is a thorough treatment of type D.

Let $\ell$ and $p$ be primes which are coprime to $6N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}({\mathrm cond}(λ))$. We determine the $\ell$-adic valuation of Hecke $L$-values $L(1,λχ)/Ω_K$ as $χ$ varies over $p$-power order anticyclotomic characters over $K$. As an application, for $p$ inert in $K$, we prove the vanishing of the $μ$-invariant of Rubin's $p$-adic $L$-function, leading to the first results on the $μ$-invariant of imaginary quadratic fields at non-split primes. Our approach and results complement the work of Hida and Finis. The approach is rooted in the arithmetic of a CM form on a definite Shimura set.The application to Rubin's $p$-adic $L$-function also relies on the proof of his conjecture.

Assuming the Riemann hypothesis and simplicity of zeros, we derive a general explicit and asymptotic formula for the summatory functions $A_{\mathfrak f}^{\exp}(x)$ of the form $$ A_{\mathfrak f}^{\exp}(x) -Δ_1(x;z,w) = Δ_{1/2}(x;z,w)\;+\;\sum_ρΔ_ρ(x;z,w,\mathfrak f)\;+\;\mathcal E(x), $$ where $Δ_1(x;z,w)$ is the main term coming from the $s=1$ singularity of $ζ(s)^z$, $Δ_{1/2}(x;z,w)$ is the secondary term coming from the $s=1/2$ singularity of $ζ(2s)^w$, the terms $Δ_ρ(x;z,w,\mathfrak f)$ arise from the singularities of $ζ(s)^z$ at nontrivial zeros $ρ$ of $ζ(s)$, and $\mathcal E(x)$ is an error term. Furthermore, we introduce a notion of \emph{bias} at the natural scale $x^{1/2}(\Log x)^{w-1}$ and obtain an explicit criteria distinguishing persistent, apparent, and unbiased behavior in this regime. The present paper treats the major parameter region $$ -1\le\Re(z)\le1,\qquad -2\le\Re(w)<1, $$ and we choose to defer the complementary ranges of $(z,w)$ to a future paper as a different analytic approach is required there.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Schurian-finiteness, also known as $τ$-tilting finiteness, is equivalent to the finiteness of various representation theoretic objects such as wide subcategories. The first three authors classified Schurian-finite blocks of type A Hecke algebras in [ALS23]. Here we study the Schurian-finiteness of blocks of type B Hecke algebras, and determine the Schurian-finiteness of all blocks if the Hecke algebra is `non-integral', and for almost all blocks in the integral case. The only remaining cases are a small number of blocks in defect $3$ when $e=3$, and a family of blocks in defects $3$ and $4$ for $e\geqslant4$. The classification is mostly achieved by methods using decomposition numbers, with many degenerate cases requiring direct study using standard methods from the representation theory of quivers.</p></details>

We state conjectures on the existence of Minkowski dimension, as well as proposed characterizations of cases in which it takes its minimal and maximal values. We establish basic cases in which the upper Minkowski dimension of $G_{f,α}$ is not maximal, and we establish basic cases in which it is minimal. We show that abelian automorphism groups always have vanishing Minkowski dimension, and as a consequence, that one of our conjectures implies a conjecture of Andrews-Petsche on pairs $(f,α)$ with abelian arboreal Galois group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unit-generated orders of a quadratic field are orders of the form $\mathcal{O} = \mathbb{Z}[\varepsilon]$, where $\varepsilon$ is a unit in the quadratic field. If the order $\mathcal{O}$ is a maximal order of a real quadratic field, then the quadratic number field is necessarily of a restricted form, being of narrow Richaud--Degert type. However, every real quadratic field contains infinitely many distinct unit-generated orders. They are parametrized as $\mathcal{O} = \mathcal{O}_{n}^{\pm}$ having quadratic discriminants $Δ(\mathcal{O}) = Δ_{n}^{+} = n^2 - 4$ (for $n \geq 3$) and $Δ(\mathcal{O}) = Δ_{n}^{-} = n^2 + 4$ (for $n \geq 1$). We show the (wide or narrow) class numbers of unit-generated orders satisfy $\log \left|{\rm Cl}(\mathcal{O})\right| \sim \log \frac{1}{2}\left|Δ(\mathcal{O})\right|$ as $\left|Δ(\mathcal{O})\right| \to \infty$, using a result of L.-K. Hua. We deduce that there are finitely many unit-generated quadratic orders of class number one and finitely many unit-generated quadratic orders whose class group is $2$-torsion. We classify all unit-generated real quadratic maximal orders having class number one. We provide numerical lists of quadratic unit-generated orders whose class groups are $2$-torsion for $Δ\leq 10^{10}$, for both wide and narrow class groups, which are conjecturally complete.</p></details>

We prove that the geometric étale cohomology of $X$ with $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$-coefficients has finitely many classes invariant under the Galois group of the maximal Kummer extension of $K$ in odd degrees. In particular, every abelian variety has finite torsion over the maximal Kummer extension. This improves results by Rössler and the second author as well as Murotani and Ozeki. We also show that finiteness of torsion of a given abelian variety over non-abelian solvable extensions of $K$ is not controlled by the Galois group of the extension.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The basis functions of the Fourier interpolation formula of Radchenko and Viazovska, constructed by means of weakly holomorphic modular forms for the Hecke theta group, are entire functions of order $2$ having interesting time-frequency properties. We give precise size estimates and study the distribution of zeros of these functions. We give in particular asymptotic estimates for the location and the number of extraneous zeros on or close to the real line. This result reveals the surprising existence of Fourier nonuniqueness pairs whose apparent ``excess'' compared to the Fourier uniqueness pair of Radchenko and Viazovska may be made arbitrarily large. Our estimates also show that the basis functions fail to yield a Riesz basis in the Hilbert space used by Kulikov, Nazarov, and Sodin in their recent study of Fourier uniqueness pairs.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce integer sequences satisfying new congruence properties inspired by the Euler and Gauss congruences, which we call Euler-Gauss sequences. Noting that every Gauss sequence is an Euler-Gauss sequence, we compare them with certain generalisations of Gauss sequences and provide several counterexamples. In particular, the Smallest Prime Factor (SPF) and Greatest Prime Factor (GPF) sequences (suitably defined at 1) studied extensively by Erdos and Alladi arise as natural examples of Euler-Gauss sequences that are not Gauss sequences. We further extend these congruence-based integer sequences to a q-analog setting and establish characteristic properties that reveal their structure and fill gaps in the literature on q-Gauss sequences. In recent works, q-Gauss sequences have been shown to admit interesting combinatorial interpretations and to exhibit the Cyclic Sieving Phenomenon (CSP). Not only do our q-Euler-Gauss sequences satisfy the standard CSP with some restriction, but we also derive a new CSP condition for the SPF and GPF sequences, not hitherto known in the literature.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the structure of the invariant subring of the tensor algebra $T(W)$ of a $G$-representation $W$, viewed as a twisted commutative algebra (tca). For a faithful representation $W$ of a finite group $G$ over a field $k$, we show that if char$(k) \mid \#G$, then $T(W)^G$ is not finitely generated as a tca. In contrast, for a representation $W$ of a classical group $G_{\mathbb{Z}}$, we prove that the invariant subring $T(W_k)^{G_k}$ is finitely generated as a tca when $k$ is algebraically closed of sufficiently large characteristic, provided that $W$ admits a good filtration over $\mathbb{Z}$. Finally, we introduce a categorical variant of the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension and compute its value to be $\binom{n+1}{2}$ for $T(\mathbb{C}^n)$ as a tca. Our key insight is to use the Schur functor to reduce questions about noncommutative invariants to those concerning vector invariants.</p></details>

The first estimate arises from a geometric restriction of the lattice to its diagonal, while the second utilizes Holder's inequality on the integral representation of the series. The methods presented here avoid modular techniques and offer a flexible analytic framework for higher-power representation problems.</p></details>

Our approach focuses on distinguished, intrinsically defined, subcategories and our main tool is the new notion of far-away orthogonality. We observe that these homological properties generalise previously studied properties on derived categories of modules over rings, and we use the generality of our theory to also examine those same attributes for the homotopy category of injectives and the big singularity category (in the sense of Krause) of an Artin algebra, as well as the derived category of a non-positive differential graded algebra. Finally, using our theory we recover and generalise various results in the theory of recollements of triangulated categories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We generalize the notion of (geometric) substitution rule to obtain overlapping substitutions. Our motivating example is the substitution presented in Ziherl, Dotera and Bekku \cite{DBZ}, which features a substitution matrix with non-integer entries. We give the meaning of such a matrix by showing that the right Perron--Frobenius eigenvector encodes the patch frequency of the resulting tiling. The patch frequencies are shown to be uniformly convergent, implying that the corresponding dynamical system is uniquely ergodic. Under mild assumptions, we further prove that the associated expansion constant is always an algebraic integer. In general, overlapping substitutions may yield a patch with illegal (partial) overlaps of tiles, even if it is locally consistent. We provide a sufficient condition for an overlapping substitution to be consistent, ensuring that no such illegal tiles emerge. Finally, we construct many intriguing one-dimensional overlapping substitutions and present higher dimensional examples from Delone multi-sets with inflation symmetry.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>While Kronecker coefficients $g(λ,μ,ν)$ with bounded rows are polynomial-time computable via lattice-point methods, no explicit closed-form formulas have been obtained for genuinely three-row cases in the 87 years since Murnaghan's foundational work. This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse. We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge. We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \mod 2)$ for all $n \geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Saxl's conjecture (2012) asserts that for the staircase partition $ρ_k = (k, k-1, \ldots, 1)$, the tensor square of the corresponding irreducible representation of the symmetric group $S_{T_k}$ contains every irreducible representation as a constituent, where $T_k = k(k+1)/2$ is the $k$th triangular number. We prove this conjecture unconditionally. Our proof introduces the Staircase Minimality Theorem: among all 2-regular partitions of $T_k$, the staircase $ρ_k$ is the unique dominance-minimal element. Combined with Ikenmeyer's theorem on dominance and Kronecker positivity for staircases, this establishes that every 2-regular partition appears in the tensor square. Modular saturation then follows using only the diagonal entries $d_{μμ} = 1$ of the decomposition matrix, and the Bessenrodt--Bowman--Sutton lifting theorem completes the proof. We further prove that at triangular numbers, staircases are the only Kronecker-universal self-conjugate partitions, providing a complete characterization.</p></details>

> **Comment:** We improved the main results

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In contrast to the theory of tilting modules, the dual theory lacks a unified definition. Nevertheless, several notions of cotilting modules have been proposed. In this paper, we compare four of the main definitions of cotilting modules that have appeared in the literature. We show that, in the setting of finitely generated right modules, three of these definitions coincide over right Artinian Noetherian algebras, and all four coincide over Artin algebras.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Improvement of Lemma 2.2 (previously Lemma 2.1), correction of Proposition 2.27 and Lemma 2.30 (previously Proposition 8.1 and Lemma 8.2) and reordering of sections. The main results remain unchanged

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the counting function of rational approximations with given bounds on the denominator and satisfying the critical Dirichlet exponent on the sphere $S^d$, $d\geq 3$. We give an effective estimate for this counting function, with an error term of square root order, analogous to the optimal estimate in the Euclidean setting. We also show that the counting function has vanishing third and higher correlations and derive a Central Limit Theorem describing its fluctuations. We prove these results using arguments from homogeneous dynamics on the space of orthogonal lattices, in particular effective multiple equidistribution of all orders, which we establish for spherical averages and which could be useful for other applications.</p></details>
