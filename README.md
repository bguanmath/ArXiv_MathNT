<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the stabilization behavior of cohomology groups associated with moduli spaces of quiver representations for a fixed quiver $Q$. Under mild conditions on a dimension vector $\delta$, we show that the dimensions of these cohomology groups stabilize when a sufficiently large multiple of $\delta$ is added. We derive explicit formulas for the stabilized dimensions and, in particular, obtain stabilization of the coefficients of Kac polynomials.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Accepted version, many minor mistakes fixed

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For the group GL(n), we construct an action of the equivariant derived category of coherent sheaves on the Grothendieck-Springer resolution on a certain subcategory of a finite monodromic Hecke category. We use this to construct a partial categorification of the projection from the extened affine to the finite Hecke algebra of GL(n). As a crucial intermediate step, we compute the exterior powers, with respect to the perversely truncated multiplicative convolution, of a parabolic Springer sheaf corresponding to a maximal parabolic subgroup fixing a line in the defining n-dimensional representation of GL(n).</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jiarui Cheng, Steven J. Miller, Sebastian Rodriguez-Labastida, Tianyu Shen, Alan Sun, Garrett Tresch &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 22 pages, 4 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a multidimensional generalization of Zeckendorf's Theorem (any positive integer can be written uniquely as a sum of non-adjacent Fibonacci numbers) to a large family of linear recurrences. This extends work of Anderson and Bicknell-Johnson in the multi-dimensional case when the underlying recurrence is the same as the Fibonacci one. Our extension applies to linear recurrence relations defined by vectors $\vec{\mathbf{c}} = (c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k)$ such that $c_1\geq c_2\geq\cdots \geq c_k$ and where $c_k = 1$. Under these conditions, we prove that every integer vector in $\mathbb{Z}^{k-1}$ admits a unique $\vec{\mathbf{c}}$-satisfying representation ($\vec{\mathbf{c}}$-SR) as a linear combination of vectors, $(\vec{\mathbf{X}}_n)_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}$ defined for every $n\in \mathbb{Z}$ by initially by zero and standard unit vectors and then the recursion $$\vec{\mathbf{X}}_{n} := c_1\vec{\mathbf{X}}_{n -1} + c_2\vec{\mathbf{X}}_{n - 2} + \cdots + c_k\vec{\mathbf{X}}_{n-k}.$$ To establish this, we introduce carrying and borrowing operations that use the defining recursion to transform any $\vec{\mathbf{c}}$ representation into a $\vec{\mathbf{c}}$-SR while preserving the underlying vector. Then, by establishing bijections with properties of scalar Positive Linear Recurrence Sequences (PLRS), we prove that these multidimensional decompositions inherit various properties, such as the number of summands exhibits Gaussian behavior and summand minimality of $\vec{\mathbf{c}}$-SRs over all all $\vec{\mathbf{c}}$-representations.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages. This version adds a reference to a paper of Hindry for a result which we previously only attributed to Harris--Silverman. It also removes a theorem we previously used but found to be incorrect, and replaces all prior instances of its use with other methods which already appeared elsewhere in the paper so that none of our main results are affected

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We work towards completely classifying all bielliptic Shimura curves $X_0^D(N)$ with nontrivial level $N$ coprime to $D$, extending a result of Rotger that provided such a classification for level one. Combined with prior work, this allows us to determine the list of all relatively prime pairs $(D,N)$ for which $X_0^D(N)$ has infinitely many degree $2$ points. As an application, we use these results to make progress on determining which curves $X_0^D(N)$ have sporadic points. Using tools similar to those that appear in this study, we also determine all of the geometrically trigonal Shimura curves $X_0^D(N)$ with $\gcd(D,N)=1$ (none of which are trigonal over $\mathbb{Q}$).</p></details>

> **Comment:** 19 pages, some figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article develops the theory of fusion categories acting on algebras. We will demonstrate that weak Hopf algebra actions on algebras correspond to specific actions of fusion categories. As an application of this theory, we introduce a family of filtered actions of weak Hopf algebras on the path algebra, and for weak Hopf algebras whose representation categories are equivalent to $\text{PSU(2)}_{p-2}$, we describe all of the separable based fusion category actions in terms of weak Hopf algebra actions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Corrects minor errors related to Schur's recurrence relations

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1975, G. E. Andrews challenged the mathematics community to address L. Ehrenpreis' problem, which was to directly prove the modularity of the Rogers-Ramanujan $q$-series' summatory forms. This question is important because many different $q$-series appearing in combinatorics, representation theory, and physics often seem to be "mysteriously" modular, yet there is no general test to confirm this directly from the exotic $q$-series expressions. In this note, we solve this general problem using $q$-series algebra and $q$-series systems of differential equations. Specifically, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which a vector of holomorphic $q$-series on $|q|<1$ forms a vector-valued modular function. This result offers a clear and conceptual path to modularity for "strange" $q$-series.</p></details>

> **Comment:** To appear in Kyushu Journal of Mathematics

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we estimate the density of the set of primes $p$ such that the $p$-th Hecke eigenvalue of an Ikeda lift is divisible by a fixed positive integer. One of the main ingredients involves the study of abelian subfields of fixed fields of the kernel of Galois representations attached to elliptic Hecke eigenforms. Further, we study the distribution of Fourier coefficients of elliptic Hecke eigenforms in arithmetic progressions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** M. Ram Murty, Sunil Naik &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a seminal paper of 1915, V. Brun introduced Brun's sieve, which is based on Brun's inequality for the M\"{o}bius function and is a very powerful tool in modern number theory. The importance of the M\"{o}bius function in enumeration problems led G.-C. Rota to introduce the concept of the M\"{o}bius function to partially ordered sets. In this article, we prove Brun's inequality for geometric lattices and develop a sieve in this context. One of the main ingredients is a recent work of K. Adiprasito, J. Huh, and E. Katz on the log-concavity of absolute values of the Whitney numbers associated with matroids. We also study shifted convolutions of the Whitney numbers associated with Dowling lattices. Further, we derive an asymptotic formula for generalized Dowling numbers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 19 pages, 5 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a generalisation of the quality of an ABC triple that we call the weighted average multiplicity (WAM), in which the logarithmic heights of prime factors are raised to a complex exponent s. The WAM is connected to the standard ABC conjecture at s=1. We show that for real part of s less than 1, WAM is unbounded over ABC triples both for integers and polynomials. For real part greater than 1, we characterise a boundary beyond which WAM is holomorphic and bounded. In this region, we show that WAM is related to the multiplicity of the largest prime factor of the triple, a quantity that we connect with the original ABC conjecture and whose distribution we explore computationally.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Federico Ambrosino, Jörg Teschner &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.FA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 21 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The analytic Langlands correspondence proposed by Etingof, Frenkel and Kazhdan describes the solution to the spectral problems naturally arising in the quantisation of the Hitchin integrable systems in terms of real opers, certain second order differential operators on a Riemann surface having real monodromy. We prove this correspondence in the cases associated to the group $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, and Riemann surfaces of genus zero with a number of punctures larger than three. A crucial ingredient is a unitary integral transformation mapping products of solutions to the ordinary differential equation associated to a real oper to eigenfunctions of the quantised Hitchin Hamiltonians. This allows us to construct joint eigenfunctions of Hecke operators and Hitchin Hamiltonians from real opers.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Damien Simon &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The object of this article is to study some aspects of the quantum geometric Langlands program in the language of vertex algebras. We investigate the representation theory of the vertex algebra of chiral differential operators on a reductive group $\mathcal{D}_{G}^{\kappa}$ for generic levels. For instance we show that the geometric Satake equivalence degenerates. Then, we study the representation theory of the equivariant affine $\mathcal{W}$-algebra $\mathcal{W}_{G}^{\kappa}$, defined by Arakawa as the principal quantum Hamiltonian reduction of $\mathcal{D}_{G}^{\kappa}$. We construct a family of simple modules for $\mathcal{W}_{G}^{\kappa}$ whose combinatorics matches that of the representation theory of the Langlands dual group. To put this construction in perspective we propose a vertex-algebraic formulation of the fundamental local equivalence of Gaitsgory and Lurie. Finally, we give a proof when the group is an algebraic torus or is simple adjoint of classical simply laced type.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of intersective polynomials having coefficients in the ring of integers $\mathscr{O}_K$ of a number field $K$, and define a notion of upper density of subsets of $\mathscr{O}_K$. We prove that given any intersective polynomial $p(x)$ over $\mathscr{O}_K$, every subset $A$ of $\mathscr{O}_K$ of positive upper density contains two distinct elements whose difference is equal to $p(x)$ for some element $x$ in $\mathscr{O}_K$. Moreover, we obtain a quantitative version of this result. The proof is motivated by an argument due to Lucier, and the Fourier-free proof of the Furstenberg--S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy theorem over the integers by Green, Tao and Ziegler.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Y. Toma has been added as a co-author. The new version contains the content of the previous version and has been rewritten and expanded including the content of Toma's paper arXiv:2502.19905

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the size of moments of quadratic character sums averaged over the family of fundamental discriminants. We obtain an asymptotic formula for all integer moments in a restricted range of parameters using a multivariate tauberian theorem. As a consequence, we prove unconditional lower bounds for all even integer moments of quadratic character sums in a wide range of parameters. Moreover, assuming the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), we prove a sharp upper bound on moments of character sums of arbitrary length. In a similar fashion, we obtain unconditional lower bounds on moments of quadratic theta functions and matching conditional upper bounds under GRH. In the case of the second moment of theta functions, we prove an optimal upper bound unconditionally improving the previous results of Louboutin and the first named author.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 82 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Peter Scholze has raised the question whether some variant of the $q$-de Rham complex is already defined over the Habiro ring $\mathcal H = \lim_{m\in\mathbb N}\mathbb Z[q]_{(q^m-1)}^\wedge$. We show that such a variant exists whenever the $q$-de Rham complex can be equipped with a "$q$-Hodge filtration": a $q$-deformation of the Hodge filtration, subject to some reasonable conditions. To any such $q$-Hodge filtration we associate a small modification of the $q$-de Rham complex, which we call the $q$-Hodge complex, and show that it descends canonically to the Habiro ring. This construction recovers and generalises the Habiro ring of a number field of Garoufalidis-Scholze-Wheeler-Zagier and is closely related to the $q$-de Rham--Witt complexes from previous work of the author as well as, conjecturally, to Scholze's analytic Habiro stack. While there's no canonical $q$-Hodge filtration in general, we show that it does exist in many cases of interest. For example, for a smooth scheme $X$ over $\mathbb Z$, the $q$-de Rham complex can be equipped with a canonical $q$-Hodge filtration as soon as one inverts all primes $p\leq \dim(X/\mathbb Z)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for number fields $K / \mathbb{Q}$ would assert that $dim V_K = ord_{s = 1/2} \zeta_K (s)$ for some vector space functorially attached to $K$. Presently there is no natural candidate for the $V_K$'s. However, assuming $V_K$ is of a cohomological nature and assuming a conjecture of Serre on the vanishing order of $\zeta_K (s)$ at $s = 1/2$ we show that such functors $K \mapsto V_K$ (with natural extra structures) exist and are all isomorphic. Their common automorphism group is $2$-torsion and abelian.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Matteo Micheli &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to better understand a family of linear degenerations of the classical Lagrangian Grassmannians $\Lambda(2n)$. It is the special case for $k=n$ of the varieties $X(k,2n)^{sp}$, introduced in previous joint work with Evgeny Feigin, Martina Lanini and Alexander P\"utz. These varieties are obtained as isotropic subvarieties of a family of quiver Grassmannians $X(n,2n)$, and are acted on by a linear degeneration of the algebraic group $Sp_{2n}$. We prove a conjecture proposed in the paper above for this particular case, which states that the ordering on the set of orbits in $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ given by closure-inclusion coincides with a combinatorially defined order on what are called symplectic $(n,2n)$-juggling patterns, much in the same way that the $Sp_{2n}$ orbits in $\Lambda(2n)$ are parametrized by a type C Weyl group with the Bruhat order. The dimension of such orbits is computed via the combinatorics of bounded affine permutations, and it coincides with the length of some permutation in a Coxeter group of affine type C. Furthermore, the varieties $X(n,2n)$ are GKM, that is, they have trivial cohomology in odd degree and are equipped with the action of an algebraic torus with finitely many fixed points and 1-dimensional orbits. In this paper it is proven that $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ is also GKM, with respect to the action of a subtorus of the above torus.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give 39 rapidly convergent continued fractions for Chowla--Selberg gamma quotients, and deduce good irrationality measures for 20 of them, including for $\mathrm{CS}(-3)=(\Gamma(1/3)/\Gamma(2/3))^3$, for $a^{1/4}\mathrm{CS}(-4)=a^{1/4}(\Gamma(1/4)/\Gamma(3/4))^2$ with $a=12$ and $a=1/5$, and for $\mathrm{CS}(-7)=\Gamma(1/7)\Gamma(2/7)\Gamma(4/7)/(\Gamma(3/7)\Gamma(5/7)\Gamma(6/7))$. These appear to be the first proved and reasonable irrationality measures for gamma quotients.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We improve the Solovay--Kitaev theorem and algorithm for a general finite, inverse-closed generating set acting on a qudit. Prior versions of the algorithm efficiently find a word of length $O(n^{3+\delta})$ to approximate an arbitrary target gate to $n$ bits of precision. Using two new ideas, each of which reduces the exponent separately, our new bound on the word length is $O(n^{1.44042\ldots+\delta})$. Our result holds more generally for any finite set that densely generates any connected, semisimple real Lie group, with an extra length term in the noncompact case to reach group elements far away from the identity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the interaction between Fourier-Mukai transforms and perverse filtrations for a certain class of dualizable abelian fibrations. Multiplicativity of the perverse filtration and the "Perverse $\supset$ Chern" phenomenon for these abelian fibrations are immediate consequences of our theory. We also show that our class of fibrations include families of compactified Jacobians of integral locally planar curves. Applications include the following: (a) we prove the motivic decomposition conjecture for this class (including compactified Jacobian fibrations), which generalizes Deninger-Murre's theorem for abelian schemes; (b) we provide a new proof of the P=W conjecture for $\mathrm{GL}_r$; (c) we prove half of the P=C conjecture concerning refined BPS invariants for the local $\mathbb{P}^2$; (d) we show that the perverse filtration for the compactified Jacobian associated with an integral locally planar curve is multiplicative, which generalizes a result of Oblomkov-Yun for homogeneous singularities. Our techniques combine Arinkin's autoduality for coherent categories, Ng\^o's support theorem for the decomposition theorem, Adams operations in operational K-theory, and Corti-Hanamura's theory of relative Chow motives.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The notion of $n$-exangulated categories was introduced by Herschend-Liu-Nakaoka, which is a simultaneous generalization of $n$-exact categories in the sense of Jasso and $(n+2)$-angulated categories in the sense of Geiss-Kelier-Oppermann. Let $(\mathscr{C},\mathbb{E},\mathfrak{s})$ be an $n$-exangulated category with enough projectives $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ a full subcategory of $\mathscr{C}$ containing $\mathcal{P}$. In the present paper, It is proved that a certian quotient category of $\mathfrak{s}$-def$(\mathcal{M})$ is abelian. We denoted by $S(\mathscr{C})$ the category of $n$-exangles, whose object are given by distinguished $n$-exangles in $\mathscr{C}$. If $\mathcal{M}=\mathscr{C}$, we obtain that a certain ideal quotient category $S(\mathscr{C})/\mathcal{R}_2$ is equivalent to the category of finitely presented modules mod-$(\mathscr{C}/[\mathcal{P}])$. Furthermore, we present the quotient category $S(\mathscr{C})/\mathcal{R}_2$ always has an abelian structure when taking $n$ as an even number. The abelian quotient $S(\mathscr{C})/\mathcal{R}_2$ admits some nice properties. We describe the projective objects in $S(\mathscr{C})/\mathcal{R}_2$ and characterize the simple objects in $S(\mathscr{C})/\mathcal{R}_2$ as Auslander-Reiten $n$-exangle sequences in $\mathscr{C}$.</p></details>

In this paper, we want to describe some Kazhdan-Lusztig right cells containing smooth elements which parameterize the smooth Schubert varieties. These elements are closely related to the study of associated varieties of highest weight modules of $\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{C})$. Firstly, we give a complete classification of the KL right cells containing only smooth elements. Then we give a sufficient condition for a KL right cell to contain only non-smooth elements by using invariant subsequences and a sufficient condition for a KL right cell to contain some smooth elements. Finally, we give an efficient algorithm to find out all the smooth elements in a given KL right cell.</p></details>

On the Galois side, we consider irreducible algebraic representations of the full centralizer group of the $L$-parameter (i.e not a component group). When $F$ is a $p$-adic field, we discuss a generalization of the endoscopic character identity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Hodge filtrations of Schmid and Vilonen on unipotent representations of real reductive groups. We show that for various well-defined classes of unipotent representations (including, for example, the oscillator representations of metaplectic groups, the minimal representations of all simple groups, and all unipotent representations of complex groups) the Hodge filtration coincides with the quantization filtration predicted by the Orbit Method. We deduce a number of longstanding conjectures about such representations, including a proof that they are unitary and a description of their $K$-types in terms of co-adjoint orbits. The proofs rely heavily on certain good homological properties of the Hodge filtrations on weakly unipotent representations, which are established using a Hodge-theoretic upgrade of the Beilinson-Bernstein theory of intertwining functors for $\mathcal{D}$-modules on the flag variety. The latter consists of an action of the affine Hecke algebra on a category of filtered monodromic $\mathcal{D}$-modules, which we use to compare Hodge filtrations coming from different localizations of the same representation. As an application of the same methods, we also prove a new cohomology vanishing theorem for mixed Hodge modules on partial flag varieties.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper continuous extensions of Dirichlet series of a particular form are established. The approach is based on the fact that these Dirichlet series and their derivatives are given by linear functionals on certain inner product spaces of meromorphic functions, the proof of which depends on the observation that if limits of derivatives do not exist then certain four dimensional subspaces are symplectic, which imposes sufficient rigidity to reach a contradiction. As an example application of Delange's Tauberian theorem, it is shown that the conjectured asymptotic in the additive divisor problem follows conditionally on the non-vanishing of a particular meromorphic function and its derivatives on the imaginary axis.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v3: minor updates

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a calculus based on graph enumeration for $S_n$-equivariant motivic invariants of graphically stratified moduli spaces. We apply our theory to the Deligne--Mumford moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}$ and to the space of torus-fixed stable maps $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}(X, \beta)^{\mathbb{C}^\star}$ when the target $X$ admits an appropriate $\mathbb{C}^\star$-action, deriving new formulas in each case. A key role is played by the P\'olya--Petersen character of a graph, which enriches P\'olya's classical cycle index polynomial. This character is valued in an algebra $\Lambda^{[2]}$ of wreath product symmetric functions, which we study from combinatorial and representation-theoretic perspectives. We prove that this algebra may be viewed as the Grothendieck ring of the category of polynomial functors which take symmetric sequences of vector spaces to vector spaces, building on foundational work of Macdonald. This leads to a plethystic action of $\Lambda^{[2]}$ on the ring $\Lambda$ of ordinary symmetric functions. Using this action, we derive our formulas, which ultimately involve only ordinary symmetric functions and the Grothendieck ring of mixed Hodge structures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove distributional results for mixed character sums \begin{equation*} \sum_{n\le x }\chi(n)e(n\theta), \end{equation*} for fixed $\theta\in [0,1]$ and random character $\chi \pmod q$, as well as for a fixed character $\chi$ and randomly sampled $\theta\in [0,1].$ We present various applications of our results. For example, we construct Littlewood polynomials with large Mahler measure, thus establishing a new record in the Mahler problem (1963). We also show that $L_{2k}$ norms of well-known Turyn polynomials are asymptotically minimized at the shift $\alpha=1/4,$ proving a conjecture of G\"unther and Schmidt. An important ingredient in our work is a general way of dealing with "log-integrability" problems.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the generating series associated with the degree sequence of a monomial self-map of a projective toric variety. We establish conditions under which this series has its circle of convergence as a natural boundary, and hence is a transcendental, non-holonomic function. In the case of toric surfaces, our results are sharp; moreover, we answer a question of Bell by proving that their reductions modulo $p$ are transcendental for all but finitely many prime numbers $p$.</p></details>

We further study their corresponding cosingularity categories and the additive categorification of the corresponding cluster algebras. The input for our constructions is a marked surface with boundary and a Dynkin quiver $I$. In the case of the triangle, these categories have been described in recent work of Keller--Liu. For general surfaces, the categories are constructed via gluing along a perverse schober, categorifying the amalgamation of cluster varieties. The case $I=A_1$ was subject of the prequel paper. We show that the cosingularity category is equivalent to the corresponding Higgs category and to the topological Fukaya category of the marked surface valued in the $1$-Calabi--Yau cluster category of type $I$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a linear--independence principle for finite families of translates in irreducible, square--integrable modulo the center (SI/Z) representations of step--two nilpotent Lie groups with one--dimensional center. Fix a one--parameter subgroup $\exp(\mathbb R X)$ and a noncentral element $Y$ (not assumed to commute with $X$). For every nonzero smooth vector $f$, any finite collection $\{\pi(\exp(x_k X))f\}_{k=1}^m$ (with distinct parameters $x_k$) of translates along $\exp(\mathbb R X)$, together with the single translate $\pi(\exp Y)f$, is linearly independent. The proof combines Schwartz regularity of matrix coefficients in the noncentral variables with an ergodic log--product estimate on a compact torus generated by commutator phases. As a result, we obtain an HRT--type statement for $(m,1)$ configurations (on--line direction with zero $X_{k_0}$--component and rogue $\exp X_{k_0}$) for all nonzero Schwartz windows, without spacing restrictions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose two Clifford+$T$ synthesis algorithms that are optimal with respect to $T$-count. The first algorithm, called deterministic synthesis, approximates any single-qubit unitary by a single-qubit Clifford+$T$ circuit with the minimum $T$-count. The second algorithm, called probabilistic synthesis, approximates any single-qubit unitary by a probabilistic mixture of single-qubit Clifford+$T$ circuits with the minimum $T$-count. For most of single-qubit unitaries, the runtimes of deterministic synthesis and probabilistic synthesis are $\varepsilon^{-1/2 - o(1)}$ and $\varepsilon^{-1/4 - o(1)}$, respectively, for an approximation error $\varepsilon$. Although this complexity is exponential in the input size, we demonstrate that our algorithms run in practical time at $\varepsilon \approx 10^{-15}$ and $\varepsilon \approx 10^{-22}$, respectively. Furthermore, we show that, for most single-qubit unitaries, the deterministic synthesis algorithm requires at most $3\log_2(1/\varepsilon) + o(\log_2(1/\varepsilon))$ $T$-gates, and the probabilistic synthesis algorithm requires at most $1.5\log_2(1/\varepsilon) + o(\log_2(1/\varepsilon))$ $T$-gates. Remarkably, complexity analyses in this work do not rely on any numerical or number-theoretic conjectures.</p></details>

Additionally, for forms in the Miller basis of an index asymptotically linear in the weight such that all zeros are on the arc, we compute the limit distribution of the zeros, which depends on the asymptotic ratio of the index to the weight.</p></details>

This phenomenon is precisely formulated in terms of semibricks. On the other hand, by applying the exchange property of odd reflections, we describe compositions of homomorphisms between Verma modules associated with different Borel subalgebras that share the same character.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given positive integers $h, N$ satisfying $1 \leqslant h \leqslant 2N^2$, we define $T(h,N)$ to be the number of $2\times 2$ integer matrices with determinant equal to $h$ whose entries lie in $[-N,N]$. Our first result states that for any $\varepsilon >0$, one has $$ T(h,N) = \frac{16}{\zeta(2)} N^2 \bigg( \sum_{d |h} \frac{1}{d} \bigg) + O_{\varepsilon}(N^{\varepsilon} (N+ h)).$$ This quantitatively improves upon recent work of Afifurrahman and Ganguly--Guria. We further show that when $N^{1 + \delta} \leqslant h \leqslant 2N^2$ for any fixed $\delta>0$, the error term above is of roughly the right order. Our second result delivers an asymptotic formula for $T(h,N)$ with square-root cancellation whenever $h = N^2 + O(N)$. This error term is much stronger than its corresponding analogue in the smoothened version of this problem. More generally, for any $\varepsilon >0$ and any $N,h \in \mathbb{N}$ with $1\leq h \leq 2N^2$, we prove that $$ T(h,N) = \bigg( \frac{8}{\zeta(2)} - 4 \bigg)N^2 \bigg( \sum_{d |h} \frac{1}{d} \bigg) + O_{\varepsilon}(N^{\varepsilon}(N+ |h-N^2|)). $$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study algebraic properties of the Tutte polynomial of a matroid and its generalizations to other combinatorially defined bivariate polynomial invariants.

First, we generalize the result of Merino-de Mier-Noy to the context of general ranked sets by exploiting a recent translation of the Brylawski relations, satisfied by the coefficients of the Tutte polynomial, into a functional identity. Second, we give the first confirmation of the conjecture of Bohn-Cameron-M{\"u}ller for infinite families of connected matroids, including the cycle graphs and the uniform matroids. Moreover, we apply the large sieve to obtain a probabilistic statement showing that suitable linear combinations of coprime Tutte polynomials generically satisfy the conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For integers $x$ and $y$, $(x, y)$ and $[x, y]$ stand for the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of $x$ and $y$ respectively. Denote by $|T|$ the number of elements of a finite set $T$. Let $a,b$ and $n$ be positive integers and let $S=\{x_1, \cdots, x_n\}$ be a set of $n$ distinct positive integers. We denote by $(S^a)$ (resp. $[S^a]$) the $n\times n$ matrix having the $a$th power of $(x_i,x_j)$ (resp. $[x_i,x_j]$) as its $(i,j)$-entry. For any $x\in S$, define $G_{S}(x):=\{d\in S: d<x, d|x \ {\rm and} \ (d|y|x, y\in S) \Rightarrow y\in \{d,x\}\}$. In this paper, we show that if $a|b$ and $S$ is gcd closed (namely, $(x_i, x_j)\in S$ for all integers $i$ and $j$ with $1\le i, j\le n$) and $\max_{x\in S}\{|G_S (x)|\}=3$ such that any elements $y_1,y_2\in G_S(x)$ satisfy that $[y_1,y_2]=x$ and $(y_1,y_2)\in G_S(y_1)\cap G_S(y_2)$), then $(S^a)|(S^b)$, $(S^a)|[S^b]$ and $[S^a]|[S^b]$ hold in the ring $M_{n}({\mathbb Z})$. This extends the Chen-Hong-Zhao theorem gotten in 2022. This also partially confirms a conjecture of Hong raised in [S.F.

For $E\subset\mathbb{F}_q^{d}$ and $N\ge1$, we study the exceptional sets $$ \mathcal{T}_1(X_\pi,E,N)=\bigl\{V\in X_\pi:\ |\pi_V(E)|\le N\bigr\},\qquad \mathcal{T}_2(X_\pi,E,N)=\bigl\{V\in X_\pi:\ |\pi_{V^\perp}(E)|\le N\bigr\}, $$ on their respective natural ranges of $N$. Using discrete Fourier analysis together with restriction/extension estimates for cone and sphere type quadrics over finite fields, we obtain sharp bounds (up to constant factors) for $\lvert \mathcal{T}_1\rvert$ and $\lvert \mathcal{T}_2\rvert$, with separate treatment of the special slices $\lambda=\pm1$ and of the isotropic slice $\lambda=0$. The bounds exhibit arithmetic-geometric dichotomies absent in the full Grassmannian: the quadratic character of $\lambda^{2}-1$ and the parity of $d$ determine the size of the exceptional sets. As an application, when $|E|\ge q$, there exists a positive proportion of elements $\mathbf{y}\in X_\pi$ such that the pinned dot-product sets $\{\mathbf{y}\cdot \mathbf{x}\colon \mathbf{x}\in E\}$ are of cardinality $\Omega(q)$. We further treat analogous families arising from the spheres of radii $0$ and $-1$, and by combining these slices, recover the known estimates for projections over the full Grassmannian, complementing a result of Chen (2018).</p></details>

> **Comment:** 83 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This work investigates the vertical quantum cohomology and quantum spectra of flag bundles, uncovering new links between the Gromov-Witten theory of homogeneous fibrations and analytic number theory. Building on previous constructions by Astashkevich and Sadov (arXiv:hep-th/9401103) and by Biswas, Das, Oh, and Paul (arXiv:2408.06616), we establish functorial and inductive properties of vertical quantum cohomology, and relate the vertical and absolute quantum spectra. We show that the degeneracy of the small vertical quantum spectrum of a Grassmann bundle - namely, the appearance of eigenvalues with unexpectedly high multiplicities - is controlled by the prime factorization of the involved ranks. This extends earlier results for Grassmannians to the relative setting and applies, in particular, to partial flag varieties viewed as total spaces of Grassmann bundles. We then introduce three families of double sequences that classify partial flag varieties according to distinct quantum spectral and combinatorial features. Their recursive and arithmetic behavior is studied through ordinary and Dirichlet generating functions. One of these sequences satisfies a Pascal-type recursion, allowing a precise analysis of its partial Dirichlet series, whose analytic continuation exhibits logarithmic singularities determined by the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Moreover, for any fixed integer shift, the diagonal subsequences display eventual polynomial behavior, which admits a natural interpretation in terms of weighted walks on graphs. Finally, we examine the vanishing pattern of one of these sequences and derive equivalent formulations of Goldbach's conjecture. Overall, the paper reveals a rich correspondence between enumerative geometry, quantum spectral degeneracy, and classical problems in prime number theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>[This is an older version of the paper, which will be updated soon.] In the present paper, we continue our research on the generalized Fermat equation $x^r + y^s = z^t$ with signature $(r, s, t)$, where $r, s, t \ge 2$ are positive integers such that $\frac{1}{r} + \frac{1}{s} + \frac{1}{t} < 1$. All known positive primitive solutions for the generalized Fermat equation when $\frac{1}{r} + \frac{1}{s} + \frac{1}{t} < 1$ are related to the Catalan solutions $1^n + 2^3 = 3^2$ and nine non-Catalan solutions. By applying inter-universal Teichm\"uller theory and its slight modification in the case of elliptic curves over rational numbers, we deduce that the generalized Fermat equation $x^r + y^s = z^t$ has no non-trivial primitive solution except for those related to the Catalan solutions and nine non-Catalan solutions mentioned above, when $(r, s, t)$ is not a permutation of the following signatures: $\bullet$ $(4,5,n)$, $(4,7,n)$, $(5,6,n)$, with $7 \le n \le 303$. $\bullet$ $(2,3,n)$, $(3,4,n)$, $(3,8,n)$, $(3,10,n)$, with $11\le n \le 109$ or $n\in \{113, 121\}$. $\bullet$ $(3,5,n)$, with $7\le n \le 3677$; $(3,7,n)$, $(3,11,n)$, with $11 \le n \le 667$. $\bullet$ $(3,m,n)$, with $13 \le m \le 17$, $m < n \le 29$; $(2,m,n)$, with $m \ge 5$, $n\ge 7$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G=GL(n)$ be the $n\times n$ complex general linear group and let $\mathcal{B}_{n}$ be its flag variety. The standard Borel subgroup $B$ of upper triangular matrices acts on the product $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ with finitely many orbits. In this paper, we study the $B$-orbits on the subvarieties $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times \mathcal{O}_{i}$, where $\mathcal{O}_{i}$ is the $B$-orbit on $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ containing the line through the origin in the direction of the $i$-th standard basis vector of $\mathbb{C}^{n}$. For each $i=1,\dots, n$, we construct a bijection between $B$-orbits on $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathcal{O}_{i}$ and certain pairs of Schubert cells in $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathcal{B}_{n}$. We also show that this bijection can be used to understand the Richardson-Springer monoid action on such $B$-orbits in terms of the classical monoid action of the symmetric group on itself. We also develop combinatorial models of these orbits and use these models to compute exponential generating functions for the sequences $\{|B\backslash(\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathcal{O}_{i})|\}_{n\geq 1}$ and $\{|B\backslash (\mathcal{B}_{n}\times \mathbb{P}^{n-1})|\}_{n\geq 1}$. In the sequel to this paper, we use the results of this paper to construct a correspondence between $B$-orbits on $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ and a collection of $B$-orbits on the flag variety $\mathcal{B}_{n+1}$ of $GL(n+1)$ and show that this correspondence respects closures relations and preserves monoid actions. As a consequence both closure relations and monoid actions for all $B$-orbits on $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ can be understood via the Bruhat order by using our results in [CE].</p></details>

In our recent work we pick up on Wiles' work and generalize the numerical criterion to ``higher codimension''. A critical ingredient is a notion of congruence module in higher codimension: this has turned out to be a key definition whose utility extends beyond the role it plays in the numerical criterion. In this paper we trace the origin of some of the ideas that led to our work, both in number theory and commutative algebra, and new directions that emerge from it. We introduce a related notion of a congruence ideal, develop some commutative algebra needed to work with it, and hint at applications to number theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The plethysm product of Schur functions corresponds to composing polynomial representations of infinite general linear groups. Finding the plethysm coefficients $\langle s_\nu \circ s_\mu, s_\lambda\rangle$ that express an arbitrary plethysm $s_\nu \circ s_\mu$ as a sum $\sum_\lambda \langle s_\nu \circ s_\mu, s_\lambda \rangle s_\lambda$ of Schur functions is a fundamental open problem in algebraic combinatorics. We prove two stability theorems for plethysm coefficients under the operations of adding and/or joining an arbitrary partition to either $\mu$ or $\nu$. In both theorems $\mu$ may be replaced with an arbitrary skew partition. As special cases we obtain all stability results on the plethysm product of two Schur functions in the literature to date. The proofs are entirely combinatorial using plethystic semistandard tableaux with positive and negative entries.</p></details>

This is a new proof of Ramanujan's congruences modulo 5, 7, and 11, as there are no nontrivial cusp forms of weight 4, 6, and 10.</p></details>

A breakthrough in the 1980s established that the Skolem Problem is indeed decidable for algebraic LRS of order at most 3, and real algebraic LRS of order at most 4. However, for general algebraic LRS of order 4 the question of decidability has remained open.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By a classic theorem of Beilinson, the perfect derived category $\mathrm{Perf}(\mathbb{P}^n)$ of projective space is equivalent to the category of derived representations of a certain quiver with relations. The vertex-wise tensor product of quiver representations corresponds to a symmetric monoidal structure $\otimes_{\mathsf{Q}}$ on $\mathrm{Perf}(\mathbb{P}^n)$. We prove that, for a certain choice of equivalence, the symmetric monoidal structure $\otimes_{\mathsf{Q}}$ may be described geometrically as an \emph{extended convolution product} in the sense that the Fourier--Mukai kernel is given by the closure of the torus multiplication map in $(\mathbb{P}^n)^3$. We also set up a general framework for such problems, allowing us to generalize the extended convolution description of quiver tensor products to the case where $\mathbb{P}^n$ is replaced by any smooth complete toric variety of Bondal--Ruan type. Under toric mirror symmetry, this extended convolution product corresponds to the tensor product of constructible sheaves on a real torus. As another generalization of our results for $\mathbb{P}^n$, we show that any finite-dimensional algebra $A$ gives rise to a monoidal structure $\star_A'$ on $\mathrm{Perf}(\mathbb{P}(A))$, providing insights into the moduli of monoidal structures on $\mathrm{Perf}(\mathbb{P}^n)$.</p></details>

The latter duality is proved by passing, via comparison theorems, to analogous sheaves representing syntomic cohomology and then reducing to Poincar\'e duality for ${\mathbf B}^+_{\rm st}$-twisted Hyodo-Kato and filtered $\mathbf{B}^+_{\rm dr}$-cohomologies that, in turn, reduce to Serre duality for smooth Stein varieties -- a classical result.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Ramanujan derived a sequence of even weight $2n$ quasimodular forms $U_{2n}(q)$ from derivatives of Jacobi's weight $3/2$ theta function. Using the generating function for this sequence, one can construct sequences of quasimodular forms of all nonnegative integer weights with minimal input: a weight 1 modular form and a power series $F(X)$. Using the weight 1 form $\theta(q)^2$ and $F(X)=\exp(X/2)$, we obtain a sequence $\{Y_n(q)\}$ of weight $n$ quasimodular forms on $\Gamma_0(4)$ whose symmetric function avatars $\widetilde{Y}_n(\pmb{x}^k)$ are the symmetric polynomials $T_n(\pmb{x}^k)$ that arise naturally in the study of syzygies of numerical semigroups. With this information, we settle two conjectures about the $T_n(\pmb{x}^k).$ Finally, we note that these polynomials are systematically given in terms of the Borel-Hirzebruch $\widehat{A}$-genus for spin manifolds, where one identifies power sum symmetric functions $p_i$ with Pontryagin classes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a functional Loomis--Whitney framework on the finite Heisenberg groups $\mathbb{H}^n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and discover connections to the boundedness and orthogonal projection problems. For $n=1$ we determine the sharp region of exponents $(u_1,u_2)$ for which the associated bilinear projection form is bounded uniformly in $q$, namely $$ \frac{1}{u_1}+\frac{2}{u_2}\le 2 \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{2}{u_1}+\frac{1}{u_2}\le 2, $$ which includes the endpoint $L^{3/2}\times L^{3/2}\to L^1$. For general $n$ we prove a multilinear estimate at the critical exponent $$ u=\frac{n(2n+1)}{n+1}, $$ via an induction on $n$ that exploits the group's fiber structure together with multilinear interpolation. Specializing to indicators yields a sharp Loomis--Whitney type set inequality that controls $|K|$ for every finite $K\subset \mathbb{H}^n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ by the sizes of its $2n$ Heisenberg projections $\{\pi_j(K)\}$, forcing a large projection in every configuration. A straightening map then converts these bounds into covering statements by additive cosets and provides a new approach to the orthogonal projection problem onto the vertical hyperplanes $\{x_j=0\}$, which presents an interesting link between commutative and non-commutative settings. The obtained results are optimal up to absolute constants, and in the planar case $n=1$, when the size of the set is not too small, our bound can be sharpened further using a point--line incidence estimate.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose an extension of the theory of parity sheaves, which allows for non-locally constant sheaves along strata. Our definition is tailored for proving the existence of (proper, quasihereditary, etc) stratifications of $\mathrm{Ext}$-algebras. We use this to study quiver Schur algebras $A(\alpha)$ for the cyclic quiver of length $2$. We find a polynomial quasihereditary structure on $A(\alpha)$ compatible with the categorified PBW basis of McNamara and Kleshchev-Muth, and sharpen their results to arbitrary characteristic. We also prove that semicuspidal algebras of $A(n\delta)$ are polynomial quasihereditary covers of semicuspidal algebras of the corresponding KLR algebra $R(n\delta)$, and compute them diagrammatically.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study graduated orders over completed group rings of $1$-dimensional admissible $p$-adic Lie groups, and verify the equivariant $p$-adic Artin conjecture for such orders. Following Jacobinski and Plesken, we obtain a formula for the conductor of a graduated order into a self-dual order. We also refine Nickel's central conductor formula by determining a hitherto implicit exponent $r_\chi$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ and $B$ be sets in a finite vector space. In this paper, we study the magnitude of the set $A\cap f(B)$, where $f$ runs through a set of transformations. More precisely, we will focus on the cases that the set of transformations is given by orthogonal matrices or orthogonal projections. We prove that if $A, B\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ satisfy some natural conditions, then, for almost every $g\in O(d)$, there are at least $\gg q^d$ elements $z\in \mathbb{F}_q^d$ such that $$|A\cap (g(B)+z)| \sim \frac{|A||B|}{q^d}.$$ This implies that $|A-gB|\gg q^d$ for almost every $g\in O(d)$. In the flavor of expanding functions, with $|A|\le |B|$, we also show that the image $A-gB$ grows exponentially. In two dimensions, the result simply says that if $|A|=q^x$ and $|B|=q^y$, as long as $0<x\le y<2$, then for almost every $g\in O(2)$, we can always find $\epsilon=\epsilon(x, y)>0$ such that $|A-gB|\gg |B|^{1+\epsilon}$. To prove these results, we need to develop new and robust incidence bounds between points and rigid motions by using a number of techniques including algebraic methods and discrete Fourier analysis. Our results are essentially sharp in odd dimensions. In the prime field plane, we further employ recent $L^2$ distance bounds and point-line/plane incidence machinery to derive improvements. Notable applications include a strong prime field analogue of a question of Mattila related to the Falconer distance problem, the Rotational Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance problem, and a quadratic expansion law. Taken together, the results in this paper present a robust two-way link between intersection phenomena and distance problems over finite fields, with dimension-uniform consequences and sharpness in several ranges.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Horn's problem is concerned with characterizing the eigenvalues $(a,b,c)$ of Hermitian matrices $(A,B,C)$ satisfying the constraint $A+B=C$ and forming the edges of a triangle in the space of Hermitian matrices. It has deep connections to tensor product invariants, Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, geometric invariant theory and the intersection theory of Schubert varieties. This paper concerns the tetrahedral Horn problem which aims to characterize the tuples of eigenvalues $(a,b,c,d,e,f)$ of Hermitian matrices $(A,B,C,D,E,F)$ forming the edges of a tetrahedron, and thus satisfying the constraints $A+B=C$, $B+D=F$, $D+C=E$ and $A+F=E$. Here we derive new inequalities satisfied by the Schur-polynomials of such eigenvalues and, using eigenvalue estimation techniques from quantum information theory, prove their satisfaction up to degree $k$ implies the existence of approximate solutions with error $O(\ln k / k)$. Moreover, the existence of these tetrahedra is related to the semiclassical asymptotics of the $6j$-symbols for the unitary group $U(n)$, which are maps between multiplicity spaces that encode the associativity relation for tensor products of irreducible representations. Using our techniques, we prove the asymptotics of norms of these $6j$-symbols are either inverse-polynomial or exponential depending on whether there exists such tetrahedra of Hermitian matrices.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 31 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study $2$-representation finite $\mathbb{K}$-algebras obtained from tensor products of tensor algebras of species. In earlier work we computed the higher preprojective algebra of said algebras to be given as Jacobian algebras of certain species with potential $(S, W)$, which are self-injective and finite dimensional. Truncating these Jacobian algebras yields a rich source of $2$-representation finite $\mathbb{K}$-algebras. Under suitable assumptions, we prove that the set of all cuts of $(S, W)$ is transitive under successive cut-mutations. Furthermore, we show that cuts and cut-mutation correspond to truncated Jacobian algebras and $2$-APR tilting, respectively. Consequently, under certain assumptions, all truncated Jacobian algebras are related to each other via $2$-APR tilting. We produce various new examples of $2$-representation finite $\mathbb{K}$-algebras.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we prove a sharpened asymptotic for the growth of analytic torsion of congruence quotients of $\SL(n,\R)/\SO(n)$ in terms of the volume. The result is based on bounds on the trace of the heat kernel, allowing control of the large time behaviour of certain orbital integrals, as well as a careful analysis of error terms. The result requires the existence of $\lambda$-strongly acyclic representations, which we define and show exists in plenitude for any $\lambda>0$. The motivation is possible applications to torsion in the cohomology of arithmetic groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let A be an abelian threefold defined over a number field K with potential multiplication by an imaginary quadratic field M. If A has signature (2,1) and the multiplication by M is defined over an at most quadratic extension, we attach to A an elliptic curve defined over K with potential complex multiplication by M, whose attached Galois representation is determined by the Hecke character associated to the determinant of the compatible system of lambda-adic representations of A. We deduce that if the geometric endomorphism algebra of A is an imaginary quadratic field, then it necessarily has class number bounded by [K:Q].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E$ be a set in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ and $S$ be a set of maps from $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ to $\mathbb{F}_p^n$. We define $$ S (E) := \bigcup_{f\in S} f(E) = \left\lbrace f(x) \colon x\in E, f\in S \right\rbrace.$$ In this paper, we establish sharp lower bounds on the size of $S(E)$ when $S$ consists of matrices from either the special linear group $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ or the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_1(\mathbb{F}_p)$. Our proofs are based on novel results on algebraic incidence-type structures associated with these groups. We also discuss higher-dimensional generalizations.</p></details>
