 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yu Nishio &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the present paper, we study the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of 2-adic local fields from the point of view of anabelian geometry. Let us recall that it is well-known that the natural homomorphism from the automorphism group of a mixed-characteristic local field to the outer automorphism group of the absolute Galois group of the given mixed-characteristic local field is injective. Moreover, Hoshi and the author of the present paper proved that, for absolutely abelian mixed-characteristic local fields with odd residue characteristic $p$ and even extension degree over ${\mathbb Q}_p$, this subgroup arising from field automorphisms is not normal in the outer automorphism group and has infinitely many distinct conjugates. As a result in this direction, one of the main results of the present paper is the assertion that if a 2-adic local field satisfies certain conditions, then the set of conjugates of the subgroup arising from field automorhisms in the outer automorphism group is infinite, which thus implies that this subgroup is not normal in the outer automorphism group. On the other hand, for an odd prime number $p$, Hoshi proved the existence of an irreducible Hodge-Tate $p$-adic representation of dimension two of the absolute Galois group of a $p$-adic local field and an automorphism of the absolute Galois group such that the $p$-adic Galois representation obtained by pulling back the given $p$-adic Galois representation by the given automorphism is not Hodge-Tate. As a result in a direction that is different from the above direction, another main result of the present paper is the existence of a pair of a representation and an automorphism that is similar to the above pair in the case where $p=2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Assuming the four exponentials conjecture, Hansel and Safer showed that if a subset $S$ of the Gaussian integers is both $α=-m+i $- and $β=-n+i$-recognizable, then it is syndetic, and they conjectured that $S$ must be eventually periodic. Without assuming the four exponentials conjecture, we show that if $α$ and $β$ are multiplicatively independent Gaussian integers, and at least one of $α$, $β$ is not an $n$-th root of an integer, then any $α$- and $β$-automatic configuration is eventually periodic; in particular we prove Hansel and Safer's conjecture. Otherwise, there exist non-eventually periodic configurations which are $α$-automatic for any root of an integer $α$. Our work generalises the Cobham-Semenov theorem to Gaussian numerations.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Arvind Ayyer, Dipendra Prasad &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 24 pages, 5 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper discusses what the dimension data of irreducible representations of a finite group looks like in some specific cases, including unipotent and reductive groups over finite fields. The essence of our investigation is whether the dimension data of irreducible representations of a finite group can be ``geometerized'', to become equal to the cardinality of certain orbit spaces. The first part of this paper deals with nilpotent and reductive groups over finite fields, whereas the second part deals with the symmetric group $S_n$. The main conclusion that we want to bring out to contrast these two cases is that for reductive groups over finite fields, the dimension data is concentrated (in a statistical sense) in a neighborhood of the maximal dimension, whereas for the symmetric group, it is spread out.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jiaqi Hou &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** minor corrections and simplifications to some proofs

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $ψ$ be an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass form with a large spectral parameter $λ>0$ on a compact arithmetic congruence hyperbolic 3-manifold $X=Γ\backslash\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})/\mathrm{SU}(2)$, and let $Y$ be a totally geodesic surface in $X$ with bounded diameter. The local $L^2$-bound for the restriction of $ψ$ to $Y$ is $\|ψ|_Y\|_{L^2(Y)}\ll λ^{1/4}$ by Burq, Gérard, and Tzvetkov. We apply the method of arithmetic amplification developed by Iwaniec and Sarnak to obtain a power saving over the local bound. The new feature in the proof is that we establish two different estimates for the integrals of $ψ|_Y$ against geodesic beams over $Y$ via two amplification arguments. Combining these estimates, we can improve the local bound for generalized Fourier coefficients of $ψ|_Y$ against eigenfunctions on $Y$ with spectral parameters near $λ$. We also apply the amplification method to obtain a power saving over the trivial bound $O(1)$ for $L^2$-norms of $ψ$ restricted to $λ^{-1/2}$-neighborhoods of unit-length geodesic segments. Consequently, by applying a result of Blair and Sogge, we obtain power savings over the local $L^p$-bounds of $ψ$ by Sogge for $2<p<4$ from our improved bound for the Kakeya-Nikodym norm.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Marc T. Pudelko &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 9 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Classical studies of the Fibonacci sequence focus on its periodicity modulo $m$ (the Pisano periods) with canonical initialization. We investigate instead the complete periodic structure arising from all $m^2$ possible initializations in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. We discover perfect chiral symmetry between the Fibonacci recurrence $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and its parity transform $a_n = - a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and observe fractal self-similarity in the extension from prime to prime power moduli. Additionally, we classify prime moduli based on their quadratic reciprocity and demonstrate that periodic sequences exhibit weight preservation under modular extension. Furthermore, we define a minima distribution $P(n)$ governed by Lucas ratios, which satisfies the symmetric relation $P(n)=P(1-n)$. For cyclotomic recurrences, we propose explicit counting functions for the number of distinct periods with connections to necklace enumeration. These findings imply potential connections to Viswanath's random recurrence, modular forms and L-functions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Christoph Pütz &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** v2: Added 4 words to the abstract

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We completely classify Laurent series converging on the unit circle over a non-Archimedean local field (of any characteristic) that map infinitely many roots of unity to roots of unity. For a given Laurent series $f$ over a field of positive characteristic with residue field $\mathbb{F}_q$, we prove effective bounds for the number of possible roots of unity in terms of the number of zeroes of the auxilliary function $f(x^q)-f(x)^q$ on the unit circle. In characteristic $0$ our bound is still effective but also depends on the ramification degree of the base field over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ as well as the size of the coefficients of $f$. This has applications to the Manin-Mumford conjecture in $\mathbb{G}_m^2$. In characteristic $0$, this work builds upon a pigeon-hole based method by Schmidt.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A well-known consequence of Schur's theorem is that for $r\in \mathbb{N}$, if $n$ is sufficiently large, then any $r$-colouring of $[n]$ results in monochromatic $a,b,c\in [n]$ such that $ab=c$. In this paper we are interested in the threshold at which the binomial random set $[n]_p$ almost surely inherits this Ramsey-type property. In particular for $r=2$ colours, we show that this threshold lies between $n^{-1/9-o(1)}$ and $n^{-1/11}$. Whilst analogous questions for solutions to (sets of) linear equations are now well understood, our work suggests that both the behaviour of the thresholds and the proof methods needed to determine them differ substantially in the non-linear setting.</p></details>

> **Comment:** preprint, 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a large field such that $K[\sqrt{-1}]$ is not algebraically closed and $F/K$ a function field in one variable. Extending techniques and results from earlier work with Becher and Dittmann, we show that every valuation ring on $F$ containing $K$ is existentially definable in the language of rings with parameters from $F$. As a consequence, using a known reduction technique, we obtain the undecidability of the existential theory of $F$ in the language of rings with appropriately chosen parameters.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Igor V. Netay &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we describe an approach to construct large extendable collections of vectors in predefined spaces of given dimensions. These collections are useful for neural network latent space configuration and training. For classification problem with large or unknown number of classes this allows to construct classifiers without classification layer and extend the number of classes without retraining of network from the very beginning. The construction allows to create large well-spaced vector collections in spaces of minimal possible dimension. If the number of classes is known or approximately predictable, one can choose sufficient enough vector collection size. If one needs to significantly extend the number of classes, one can extend the collection in the same latent space, or to incorporate the collection into collection of higher dimensions with same spacing between vectors. Also, regular symmetric structure of constructed vector collections can significantly simplify problems of search for nearest cluster centers or embeddings in the latent space. Construction of vector collections is based on combinatorics and geometry of semi-simple Lie groups irreducible representations with highest weight.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 47 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study categories of dualizable torsion and complete objects for compactly-rigidly generated tensor-triangulated categories T with a Noetherian central action of a graded commutative Noetherian ring R. We show that they always admit a natural Noetherian action of the completed graded ring R^ and that the categories of dualizable torsion and complete objects can be abstractly reconstructed as tensor-triangulated R^-linear categories from the category of compact torsions objects with the corresponding structure. If the category of compact objects of T in addition admits a strong generator g, we show that the torsion coreflection (resp. complete reflection) of g is a strong generator for the category of dualizable torsion (resp. dualizable complete) objects. In that case, we also show that the categories of dualizable torsion and compact torsion objects determine each other in terms of Brown-type representability theorems.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a field of positive characteristic with no algebraically closed subfield. Let $F$ be a function field over $K$ and $t \in F$ transcendental over $K$. Refining a result of Eisentr{ä}ger and Shlapentokh, we show that there is no algorithm which, on input a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[t][X_1, \ldots, X_n]$, determines whether $f$ has a zero in $F^n$. To this end, we revisit and partially extend several recent results from the literature on existential definability in function fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Supersingular elliptic curve isogeny graphs underlie isogeny-based cryptography. For isogenies of a single prime degree $\ell$, their structure has been investigated graph-theoretically. We generalise the notion of $\ell$-isogeny graphs to $L$-isogeny graphs (studied in the prime field case by Delfs and Galbraith), where $L$ is a set of small primes dictating the allowed isogeny degrees in the graph. We analyse the graph-theoretic structure of $L$-isogeny graphs. Our approaches may be put into two categories: cycles and graph cuts. On the topic of cycles, we provide: a count for the number of cycles in the $L$-isogeny graph with cyclic kernels using traces of Brandt matrices; an efficiently computable estimate based on this approach; and a third ideal-theoretic count for a certain subclass of $L$-isogeny cycles. We provide code to compute each of these three counts. On the topic of graph cuts, we compare several algorithms to compute graph cuts which minimise a measure called the edge expansion, outlining a cryptographic motivation for doing so. Our results show that a greedy neighbour algorithm out-performs standard spectral algorithms for computing optimal graph cuts. We provide code and study explicit examples. Furthermore, we describe several directions of active and future research.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 143 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study locally analytic vectors in the "partially" completed cohomology of Shimura varieties associated with some rank $2$ unitary groups over a totally real field $F^+$ such that $F^+_v = \mathbb{Q}_{p^2}$ for some $p$-adic places $v$ and prove a certain classicality theorem. This is a partial generalization and modification of Lue Pan's work in the modular curve case by using the works of Caraiani-Scholze, Koshikawa and Zou on mod $l$ cohomology of Shimura varieties. As applications, we prove the automorphy lifting theorem and the Breuil-M$\mathrm{\acute{e}}$zard conjecture in some $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_{p^2})$ cases. We will assume a technical regularity condition on Serre weights of residual representations, but we don't assume any technical condition on the properties of liftings of residual representations at $p$-adic places except Hodge-Tate regularity. It should be noted that previously, such results were known only when we assumed that $F^+_v$ is equal to $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for any $p$-adic place $v$ of $F^+$ so that we can use the $p$-adic Langlands correspondence of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. Moreover, we propose a conjectural strategy to prove such results in some $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_{p^f})$ cases.</p></details>

Finally, we discuss pseudoinverses for delta operators and illustrate our methods with a variety of examples.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We sharpen and generalize the dimension growth bounds for the number of points of bounded height lying on an irreducible algebraic variety of degree $d$, over any global field. In particular, we focus on the affine hypersurface situation by relaxing the condition on the top degree homogeneous part of the polynomial describing the affine hypersurface, while sharpening the dependence on the degree in the bounds compared to previous results. We formulate a conjecture about plane curves which provides a conjectural approach to the uniform degree $3$ case (the only remaining open case). For induction on dimension, we develop a higher dimensional effective version of Hilbert's irreducibility theorem, which is of independent interest.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we generalize the special subset of the Markov-Lagrange spectrum (and the Markov spectrum) called the discrete Markov spectrum. The discrete Markov spectrum is defined in terms of the Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz.$ Using the tool called snake graphs, originating from cluster algebra theory, we first reconstruct proofs of its properties in a combinatorial framework and then extend it to the generalized setting. We then introduce the generalized discrete Markov spectrum, defined analogously via the generalized Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k_1 yz + k_2 zx + k_3 xy = (3 + k_1 + k_2 + k_3) xyz.$ We prove that this generalized spectrum is contained in the Markov-Lagrange spectrum and thus the Markov spectrum.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By work of a number of authors, beginning with Scott and culminating with Galashin and Lam, the coordinate rings of positroid varieties in the Grassmannian carry cluster algebra structures. In fact, they typically carry many such structures, the two best understood being the source-labelled and target-labelled structures, referring to how the initial cluster is computed from a Postnikov diagram or plabic graph. In this article, we show that these two cluster algebra structures quasi-coincide, meaning in particular that a cluster variable in one structure may be expressed in the other structure as the product of a cluster variable and a Laurent monomial in the frozen variables. This resolves a conjecture attributed to Muller and Speyer from 2017. The proof depends critically on categorification: of the relevant cluster algebra structures by the author, of perfect matchings and twists by the author with Çanakçı and King, and of quasi-equivalences of cluster algebras by Fraser and Keller. By similar techniques, we also show that Muller and Speyer's left twist map is a quasi-cluster equivalence from the target-labelled structure to the source-labelled structure.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study small-doubling subsets of finite-dimensional vector spaces over finite fields of odd characteristic. Let $A \subset \mathbb{F}_p^n$ be non-empty with $|A+A| \le K|A|$. We prove that $A$ can be covered by at most $K^{O(1)}$ cosets of a subspace $H \le \mathbb{F}_p^n$ with $|H| \le K^{O(1)}|A|$, giving a polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa (PFR/Marton) theorem in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ for odd primes $p$. The key input is a polynomial stability lemma which yields a dichotomy: either the $L^4$ Fourier mass of $1_A$ concentrates on a span of dimension $\mathrm{poly}(K)$, or in a quotient of codimension $\mathrm{poly}(K)$ the doubling constant decreases by at least $K^{-C}$. Iterating the latter alternative and combining it with standard covering arguments gives the polynomial-structured conclusion. In conjunction with the characteristic-$2$ results of Green, Gowers, Manners, and Tao, our methods provide an alternative finite-field route to Marton-type Freiman--Ruzsa theorems across all characteristics.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 10 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a new generalization of the perfect numbers, called $\mathcal{S}$-perfect numbers. Briefly stated, an $\mathcal{S}$-perfect number is an integer equal to a weighted sum of its proper divisors, where the weights are drawn from some fixed set $\mathcal{S}$ of integers. After a short exposition of the definitions and some basic results, we present our preliminary investigations into the $\mathcal{S}$-perfect numbers for various special sets $\mathcal{S}$ of small cardinality. In particular, we show that there are infinitely many $\{0, m\}$-perfect numbers and $\{-1,m\}$-perfect numbers for every $m \geq 1$. We also provide a characterization of the $\{-1,m\}$-perfect numbers of the form $2^kp$ ($k \geq 1$, $p$ an odd prime), as well as a characterization of all even $\{-1, 1\}$-perfect numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by the convolutive behavior of the counting function for partitions with designated summands in which all parts are odd, we consider coefficient sequences $(a_n)_{n\ge 0}$ of primitive eta-products that satisfy the generic convolutive property \begin{align*} \sum_{n\ge 0} a_{mn} q^n = \left(\sum_{n\ge 0} a_n q^n\right)^m \end{align*} for a specific positive integer $m$. Given the results of an exhaustive search of the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences for such sequences for $m$ up to $6$, we first focus on the case where $m=2$ with our attention mainly paid to the combinatorics of two $2$-convolutive sequences, featuring bijective proofs for both. For other $2$-convolutive sequences discovered in the OEIS, we apply generating function manipulations to show their convolutivity. We also give two examples of $3$-convolutive sequences. Finally, we discuss other convolutive series that are not eta-products.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a natural enlargement of the BGG Category O for a semisimple Lie algebra: the category of weight modules with trivial central character and finite-dimensional weight spaces supported on the root lattice. We give a geometric realization of this category as unipotently monodromic sheaves on the flag variety satisfying a singular support condition. We then explain that a derived version $\mathcal{D}$ of this category is Koszul dual to the Kazhdan-Laumon Category O, a different enlargement of the BGG Category O obtained from a gluing construction for sheaves on the flag variety. This characterizes $\mathcal{D}$ as the category of algebras over a natural monad on a direct sum of copies of the derived Category O. These results give new interpretations of classical algebraic constructions of weight modules over semisimple Lie algebras due to Fernando and Mathieu. We also conjecture that our results fit naturally into a proposed Koszul duality relating the small quantum group and the semi-infinite flag variety to the geometry of affine Springer fibers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Drinfeld's degenerate affine analog of Schur-Weyl duality relates representations of the degenerate affine Hecke algebra $AH_r$ to representations of the Yangian $Y_n$. One way to understand the construction is to introduce an intermediate algebra $AS(n,r)$, the degenerate affine Schur algebra, which appears both as the endomorphism algebra of an induced tensor space over $AH_r$, and as the image of a homomorphism $D_{n,r}:Y_n \rightarrow AS(n,r)$. In this paper, we describe $D_{n,r}$ using a diagrammatic calculus. Then we use a theorem of Drinfeld to compute $\ker D_{n,r}$ when $n > r$, thereby giving a presentation of $AS(n,r)$ in these cases. We formulate a conjecture in the remaining cases. Finally, we apply results of Arakawa to develop some of the representation theory of $AS(n,r)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the additive theory of the set $S = \{1^c, 2^c, \dots, N^c\}$ when $c$ is a real number. In the language of additive combinatorics, we determine the asymptotic behaviour of the additive energy of $S$. When $c$ is rational, this is either known, or follows from existing results, and our contribution is a resolution of the irrational case. We deduce that for all $c \not \in \{0, 1, 2\}$, the cardinality of the sumset $S + S$ asymptotically attains its natural upper bound $N(N + 1)/2$, as $N \to \infty$. We show that there are infinitely many, effectively computable numbers $c$ such that the set $\{p^c : \textrm{$p$ prime}\}$ is additively dissociated (actually linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$), and we provide an effective procedure to compute the digits of such $c$.</p></details>

When $k =0$, this recovers the ordinary Markov numbers. A long-standing question in the theory of Markov numbers is Frobenius's unicity conjecture, concerning whether every Markov number is the maximum in a unique solution triple. Aigner gave a series of weaker, related conjectures which were confirmed to be true by Lee, Li, Rabideau, and Schiffler using techniques from the theory of cluster algebras. We show here that $k$-Markov numbers also satisfy Aigner's conjectures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the representation theory of various convolution algebras attached to the $q$-deformation of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ from an algebraic perspective and beyond the unitary case. We show that many aspects of the classical representation theory of real semisimple groups can be transposed to this context. In particular, we prove an analogue of the Harish-Chandra isomorphism and we introduce an analogue of parabolic induction. We use these tools to classify the non-unitary irreducible representations of $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. Moreover, we explicitly show how they converge to the classical admissible dual of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. For that purpose, we define a version of the quantized universal enveloping algebra defined over the ring of analytic functions on $\mathbb{R}_+^*$, which specializes at $q = 1$ to the enveloping $\ast$-algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$.</p></details>

We give examples of Anosov subgroups which are neither free nor surface groups for some sets of roots which do not fall under the previous results.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct left and right Calabi-Yau structures on derived respectively singularity categories of symmetric orders $Λ$ over commutative Gorenstein rings $R$. For this, we first construct Calabi-Yau structures over $R$ by lifting Amiot's construction of Calabi-Yau structures on Verdier quotients to the dg level. Then we prove base change properties relating Calabi-Yau structures over $R$ to those over the base field $k$. As a result, we prove the existence of a right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category associated with $Λ$ which is a cyclic lift of the weak Calabi-Yau structure constructed by the first-named author and Iyama. We also show the existence of a left Calabi-Yau structure on the dg bounded derived category of $Λ$. This is a non-commutative generalization of a result by Brav and Dyckerhoff. By combining the existence of the right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category with a structure theorem by Keller and the second-named author, we deduce that under suitable hypotheses, the singularity category associated with $Λ$ is triangle equivalent to a generalized cluster category in the sense of Amiot.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, assuming the weak Schanuel Conjecture (WSC), we prove that for any collection of pairwise non-arithmetically equivalent totally real number fields, the residues at $s=1$ of their Dedekind zeta functions form a linearly independent set over the field of algebraic numbers. As a corollary, we obtain that, under WSC, two totally real number fields have the same regulator if and only if they have the same class number and Dedekind zeta function. We also prove that, under WSC, the isometry and similarity classes of the log unit lattice of a real Galois number field of degree $[K:\Q]\geq 4$, characterize the isomorphism class of said field. All of our results follow from establishing that, under WSC, any Gram matrix of the log unit lattice of a real Galois number field yields a generic point of certain closed irreducible $\Q$-subvariety of the space of symmetric matrices of appropriate size.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a framework for describing vector bundles on $μ_n$-gerbes over curves and illustrate the construction through two detailed examples. Using the interpretation of Brauer classes as obstructions to descending determinantal line bundles from the algebraic closure, together with a geometric analysis of the moduli space of twisted sheaves, we prove that for genus $2$ curves there exist Brauer classes over the base field whose period equals their index. Over $C_1$-fields, we further show that every $2$-torsion class in the Brauer group of a genus $2$ curve satisfies the period-index problem. As an application, we construct higher-dimensional varieties obtained as fibre products of genus $2$ curves over $C_1$-fields whose $2$-torsion algebraic Brauer classes also satisfy the period-index problem, providing new evidence toward the period-index conjecture.</p></details>

Over a finite field this bijection implies that the probability that an operator be nilpotent is the reciprocal of the number of vectors in $V$. We generalize this correspondence to pairs of operators between pairs of vector spaces and determine the probability that a random pair of operators be nilpotent. We also determine the set-theoretical counterpart of this construction and compute the number of eventually constant pairs of maps between two finite sets, closely related to the number of spanning trees in a complete bipartite graph.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a number field with a finite set $S$ of primes. We study the cohomology of $\mathbb{F}_p[G_{K,S}]$-modules $A$, in particular the Shafarevich groups $\Sha^i_S(K,A)$ for $i=1,2$ for tame sets $S$, i.e., for sets $S$ that contain no primes above $p$. When $S$ contains all primes above $p$ (the ``wild'' setting), it is a consequence of global Poitou-Tate duality that $\Sha^1_S(K,A')^\vee \simeq \Sha^2_S(K,A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\hookrightarrow} \RusB_S(K,A) $ is non-increasing as $S$ increases. The same applies when $G_{K,S}$ is replaced by its maximal pro-$p$ quotient $G_{K,S}(p)$. In [4] it was shown that for $S$ tame and $A=\mathbb{F}_p$ with trivial action, the group $\Sha^2_S(K, A)$ can increase as $S$ increases to $S\cup X$, and even attain its maximal dimension, $\dim_{\mathbb{F}_p} \RusB_S(K,\mathbb{F}_p)$, for carefully chosen $X$. We strengthen this to general $\mathbb{F}_p[G_{K,S}]$-modules $A$ where $S$ is tame. We use Liu's definition [7] of $\RusB_S(K,A)$ to show that $\Sha^2_S(K,A) \hookrightarrow \RusB_S(K,A)$ and that there exist infinitely many tame sets of primes $X$ of $K$ such that $\Sha^2_{S\cup X}(K,A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\hookrightarrow} \RusB_{S \cup X}(K,A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\twoheadleftarrow} \RusB_S(K,A) \hookleftarrow \Sha^2_S(K,A)$.</p></details>

We also obtain explicit weight transforms in the analytic newvector and spherical cases. Applications include first-moment estimates for $\mathrm{GL}_3\times\mathrm{GL}_2$ $L$-functions over number fields, an explicit twisted fourth moment for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ $L$-functions over totally real fields, a sharp upper bound for the fifth moment, subconvexity for triple product $L$-functions, and new simultaneous nonvanishing results.</p></details>

Degeneracy leads to some interesting challenges when computing Sato-Tate groups, and there are currently few examples and techniques presented in the literature. In this paper we focus on the Jacobians of the family of curves $C_{p^2}: y^2=x^{p^2}-1$, where $p$ is an odd prime. Using a construction developed by Shioda in the 1980s, we are able to characterize so-called indecomposable Hodge classes as well as the Sato-Tate groups of these Jacobian varieties. Our work is inspired by computation, and examples and methods are described throughout the paper.</p></details>

We demonstrate that with sufficient averaging in the coefficients of $f$ (viz. exponential in the size of the inputs), one can not only prove Bateman--Horn results on average but also pin down precise information about the distribution of prime values. We show that 100\% of polynomials (in an $L^k$ sense for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$) satisfy the Bateman--Horn Conjecture, and that that 100\% of polynomials (in an $L^2$ sense) satisfy an appropriate polynomial analogue of the Hardy--Littlewood Prime Tuples Conjecture. We use the latter to prove that 100\% of polynomials satisfy the appropriate analogue of the Poisson Tail Conjecture, in the sense that the distribution of the gaps between consecutive prime values around the average spacing is Poisson. We also study the frequencies of sign patterns of the Liouville function evaluated at the consecutive outputs of $f$; viewing $f$ as a random variable, we establish the limiting distribution for every sign pattern. The Chowla problem along random polynomials is a special case. A key input behind all of our arguments is Leng's recent quantitative work on the higher-order Fourier uniformity of the von Mangoldt and Möbius functions (in turn relying on Leng, Sah, and Sawhney's quantitative inverse theorem for the Gowers norms).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The distribution of prime constellations, such as Twin Primes ($p, p+2$), is traditionally analyzed via probabilistic models or analytic sieve theory. While heuristic predictions are accurate, rigorous proofs are obstructed by the "Parity Barrier", which prevents classical sieves from distinguishing primes from semi-primes in the asymptotic limit. In this work, we present a structural proof of existence based on deterministic signal processing. We treat the sequence of integers as a signal generated by a rigid Diophantine basis ($N=2n+3m$) and define a fundamental certification window $\mathcal{W} = [P, m_0^2)$ derived from the basis limit $m_0$. We demonstrate that the non-existence of constellations (the "Null Hypothesis") constitutes a low-entropy signal state, a "Prime Desert", that requires infinite spectral resolution to maintain over a quadratic window. Since the sieving basis is finite ($p \le m_0$), the system is band-limited and structurally incapable of synthesizing the destructive interference required to sustain a zero count. By invoking the Chinese Remainder Theorem and analyzing the detailed correlation structure of residue classes, we prove that positive and negative correlations between sieved positions cancel at leading order, constraining the variance of the signal to scale linearly with the mean ($O(μ)$) rather than the quadratic scaling ($Ω(μ^2)$) required to support a Prime Desert. This Variance Gap implies that the signal must strictly oscillate around its mean, rendering the existence of prime constellations a mandatory consequence of the system's finite spectral bandwidth.</p></details>

However, the above effort does not provide sufficient conditions for the existence of permutiples. In this paper, we provide such a condition which we will state using the language of multigraphs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A permutiple is a natural number whose representation in some base, $b>1$, is an integer multiple of a number whose base-$b$ representation has the same collection of digits. Previous efforts have made progress in finding such numbers using graph-theoretical and finite-state-machine constructions. These are the mother graph and the Hoey-Sloane machine. In this paper, we leverage the inherent symmetry of the above constructions for the purpose of finding new permutiples from old. Such results also help us to see previous work through a new lens.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Symplectic slice theorems elucidate the local structure of symplectic manifolds carrying Hamiltonian actions of compact Lie groups. We generalize these theorems in two natural settings. The first is based on the idea that complex reductive algebraic groups are the natural complex-geometric counterparts of compact Lie groups. Using new definitions of Poisson and symplectic slices, we prove analogues of the classical symplectic slice theorems for Hamiltonian actions of complex reductive algebraic groups. These analogues have versions in the complex-algebraic and holomorphic categories, and make extensive use of Slodowy slices and decomposition classes in complex reductive Lie algebras. The starting point for our second setting is the fact that Hamiltonian Lie group actions are special cases of Hamiltonian symplectic groupoid actions. We generalize the classical symplectic slice theorems to the latter case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the prefundamental modules $L_{s,a}^{\pm}$ over the Borel subalgebras of the twisted quantum loop algebras, which are introduced by Wang. A character formula for $L_{s,a}^{\pm}$ is obtained from that for the prefundamental modules over the untwisted quantum loop algebras by applying a character folding map. This allows us to realize minuscule prefundamental modules $L_{s,a}^{\pm}$ for types $A_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ and $D_{n+1}^{(2)}$ in terms of the unipotent quantum coordinate ring associated with the fundamental $s$-th coweight, where $s = 1$ for type $A_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ and $s = n$ for type $D_{n+1}^{(2)}$. This result is a continuation of the realization of (co)minuscule prefundamental modules established by earlier works [J-Kwon-Park, Int. Math. Res. Not., 2023] and [J-Kwon-Park, J.

This improves the recent results of Basak, Nath and Zaharescu, who established this for $g(p) = (\log p)^A, A>1$. We also use the best currently available tools to expand the original central limit theorem of Davenport and Erdős for all the primes to a shorter interval of starting points.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $q=p^f$ be a prime power and let $H$ be a classical group of type $A$, so $H \cong \mathrm{SL}_d(q)$ or $\mathrm{GL}_d(q)$, acting on its natural module $V$ of dimension $d$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Let $W$ be an absolutely irreducible $\mathbb{F}_qH$--module such that, over an algebraic closure, $W$ is isomorphic (up to Frobenius twists) to a tensor product $\bigotimes_{t=1}^r L(λ^{(t)})$, where each $L(λ^{(t)})$ is an irreducible polynomial representation of $\mathrm{GL}_d$ of degree $k_t$, and the total degree $K=\sum_t k_t$ satisfies $K<q-1$. We prove a base-$q$ injectivity lemma which shows that, for a Singer cycle $s \in H$, the eigenvalues of $s$ on $W \otimes_{\mathbb{F}_q} \mathbb{F}_{q^d}$ are parametrised by digit vectors of length $d$ with entries bounded by $K$. In particular, distinct weights of $W$ correspond to distinct eigenvalues. If in addition $W$ is multiplicity-free for the diagonal torus of $\mathrm{GL}_d$, then every eigenspace of $s$ is one-dimensional, so $s$ has a simple spectrum on $W$. Using this spectral property we design a Las Vegas rewriting algorithm which, given $G \leq \mathrm{GL}(W)$ isomorphic to $H$ and acting irreducibly on $W$, constructs a projective representation of $G$ of degree $d$ equivalent to the natural representation of $H$. The expected running time is polynomial in $d$, $\log q$ and $K$, and in the cost of field operations and discrete logarithm computations in $\mathbb{F}_{q^d}$. This extends earlier rewriting algorithms of Magaard--O'Brien--Seress and of Gül--Ankaralıoğlu to a broader class of twisted tensor products of polynomial modules.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 14 pages. Mostly minor revisions from v2, with added application to explicit construction of cubic extensions of number fields

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the question of determining whether two binary cubic forms over an arbitrary field $K$ whose characteristic is not $2$ or $3$ are equivalent under the actions of either GL$(2,K)$ or SL$(2,K)$, deriving two necessary and sufficient criteria for such equivalence in each case. One of these involves an algebraic invariant of binary cubic forms which we call the Cardano invariant, which is closely connected to classical formulas and also appears in the work of Bhargava et al. The second criterion is expressed in terms of the base field itself, and also gives explicit matrices in SL$(2,K)$ or GL$(2,K)$ transforming one cubic into the other, if any exist, in terms of the coefficients of bilinear factors of a bicovariant of the two cubics. We also consider automorphisms of a single binary cubic form, show how to use our results to test equivalence of binary cubic forms over an integral domain such as~$\mathbb{Z}$, and briefly recall some connections between binary cubic forms and the arithmetic of elliptic curves. The methods used are elementary, and similar to those used in our earlier work with Fisher concerning equivalences between binary quartic forms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a simple $q$-ary family of single-error-correcting, double-error-detecting (SEC--DED) linear codes whose parity checks are tied directly to the base-$p$ ($q=p$ prime) digits of the coordinate index. For blocklength $n=p^r$ the construction uses only $r+1$ parity checks -- \emph{near-Hamming} overhead -- and admits an index-based decoder that runs in a single pass with constant-time location and magnitude recovery from the syndromes. Based on the prototype, we develop two extensions: Code A1, which removes specific redundant trits to achieve higher information rate and support variable-length encoding; and Code A2, which incorporates two group-sum checks together with a 3-wise XOR linear independence condition on index subsets, yielding a ternary distance-4 (SEC--TED) variant. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the framework generalizes via $n$-wise XOR linearly independent sets to construct codes with distance $d = n + 1$, notably recovering the ternary Golay code for $n = 5$ -- showing both structural generality and a serendipitous link to optimal classical codes. Our contribution is not optimality but \emph{implementational simplicity} and an \emph{array-friendly} structure: the checks are digitwise and global sums, the mapping from syndromes to error location is explicit, and the SEC--TED upgrade is modular. We position the scheme against classical $q$-ary Hamming and SPC/product-code baselines and provide a small comparison of parity overhead, decoding work, and two-error behavior.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Many natural computational problems in computer science, mathematics, physics, and other sciences amount to deciding if two objects are equivalent. Often this equivalence is defined in terms of group actions. A natural question is to ask when two objects can be distinguished by polynomial functions that are invariant under the group action. For finite groups, this is the usual notion of equivalence, but for continuous groups like the general linear groups it gives rise to a new notion, called orbit closure intersection. It captures, among others, the graph isomorphism problem, noncommutative PIT, null cone problems in invariant theory, equivalence problems for tensor networks, and the classification of multiparty quantum states. Despite recent algorithmic progress in celebrated special cases, the computational complexity of general orbit closure intersection problems is currently quite unclear. In particular, tensors seem to give rise to the most difficult problems. In this work we start a systematic study of orbit closure intersection from the complexity-theoretic viewpoint. To this end, we define a complexity class TOCI that captures the power of orbit closure intersection problems for general tensor actions, give an appropriate notion of algebraic reductions that imply polynomial-time reductions in the usual sense, but are amenable to invariant-theoretic techniques, identify natural tensor problems that are complete for TOCI, including the equivalence of 2D tensor networks with constant physical dimension, and show that the graph isomorphism problem can be reduced to these complete problems, hence GI$\subseteq$TOCI. As such, our work establishes the first lower bound on the computational complexity of orbit closure intersection problems, and it explains the difficulty of finding unconditional polynomial-time algorithms beyond special cases, as has been observed in the literature.</p></details>

Moreover, we construct two tilting objects over the squid algebra - one via generalised APR-tilting and one via one-point-extensions and reflection functors - and identify their endomorphism algebras with the Coxeter-Dynkin algebra. This shows that our definition gives another representative in the derived equivalence class of the squid algebra, and hence of the corresponding canonical algebra. Finally, we have a closer look at the Grothendieck group and the Euler form which illustrates the connection to Saito's classification of marked extended affine root systems. On the other hand, this enables us to prove that in the domestic case Coxeter-Dynkin algebras are of finite representation type.</p></details>

In this article we study when a distributive lattice has a pure minimal injective coresolution, a notion first introduced and studied in a work of Ajitabh, Smith and Zhang. We will see that this problem naturally leads to studying when certain antichain modules are perfect modules. We give a classification of perfect antichain modules under the assumption that their canonical antichain resolution is minimal and use this to give a completion classification in lattice theoretic terms of incidence algebras of distributive lattices with pure minimal injective coresolution. We use our results to answer a question raised by Ajitabh, Smith and Zhang by showing that there exist Auslander-Gorenstein polynomial identity rings without a pure injective coresolution.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, for a given Dirichlet character mod $N$ with $4\nmid N$, we give a lower bound of order $\sqrt{s/\log(s)}$ for the dimension of the $\mathbb{Q}(e^{2iπ/N})$-vector space spanned by the values of its $L$-function at integers $\leq s$ of a given parity. We thus generalize a result Fischler proved in 2021, corresponding to the principal character mod 1. To this end, we construct linear combinations of these values of $L$-function with a refined version of Siegel's lemma, and we apply to them a linear independence criterion generalizing the one used by Fischler. To check the assumptions of this criterion, we rely on a ``Shidlovskii's lemma''.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any homogeneous space of a noncompact semisimple Lie group $G$, we define an exponent with multiple interpretations from representation theory and group theory. As an application, we give a temperedness criterion for $L^2 (G/H)$ for any closed subgroup $H$ of $G$, which extends the existing ones of Benoist--Kobayashi for connected subgroups and Lutsko--Weich--Wolf for discrete subgroups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider mod $p$ Hilbert modular forms for a totally real field $F$, viewed as sections of automorphic line bundles on Hilbert modular varieties in prime characteristic $p$. For a Hecke eigenform of arbitrary weight, we prove the existence of an associated two-dimensional representation of the absolute Galois group of $F$. Furthermore, for any such irreducible Galois representation, we formulate a conjecture predicting the set of weights of eigenforms from which it arises. This generalizes Edixhoven's variant of the weight part of Serre's Conjecture (in the case $F = \mathbb{Q}$), and removes the restriction that $p$ be unramified in $F$ from prior work in this direction. We also establish one direction of a conjectural relation with the algebraic analogue of the weight part of Serre's Conjecture in this context. Finally, we prove results towards our conjecture in the case of partial weight one for real quadratic fields $F$ in which $p$ is ramified.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the elements of the Kazhdan--Lusztig basis of the spherical Hecke algebra of type $G_2$ have an atomic decomposition. As a by-product, we obtain a new algorithm to compute generalized Kostka--Foulkes polynomials in type $G_2$.</p></details>
