### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14220v1'>2509.14220</a>\]&nbsp; **Tensor Products with Verma Module and Restriction to Parabolic Subalgebra**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Antoine Merceron &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using the tensor identity, we obtain decomposition results for the tensor product of a generalized Verma module with a module $M$ in the category $\mathcal{O}^{\mathfrak{p}}$, based on the decomposition of the restriction of $M$ to the parabolic subalgebra $\mathfrak{p}$. We show that this restriction admits an essentially unique decomposition into indecomposable $\mathfrak{p}$-modules and identify two particular types of direct summands: finite-dimensional quotients and tilting submodules. Finally, we give the complete $\mathfrak{b}$-decomposition of all indecomposable $M \in \mathcal{O}$ in $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, and of all Verma modules in the block of a dominant integral weight in $\mathfrak{sl}_3$, from which we derive explicit computations.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 7 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a generalisation of vector fields on a vector space, where the vector space is generalised to a highest-weight module over a Kac-Moody algebra. The generalised vector field is an element in a non-associative superalgebra defined by the module and the Kac-Moody algebra. Also the Lie derivative of a vector field parameterised by another is generalised and expressed in a simple way in terms of this superalgebra. It reproduces the generalised Lie derivative in the general framework of extended geometry, which in special cases reduces to the one in exceptional field theory, unifying diffeomorphisms with gauge transformations in supergravity theories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1959, Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres posed a series of problems concerning the size of polynomials of the form $$ P_n(z) = \prod_{j=1}^n (1 - z^{s_j}), $$ where $s_1, \dots, s_n$ are positive integers. Of particular interest is the quantity $$ f(n) = \inf_{s_1,\dots,s_n\ge 1} \max_{|z|=1} |P_n(z)|. $$They proved that $\lim_{n\to\infty} f(n)^{1/n} = 1$, and also established the classical lower bound $f(n) \ge \sqrt{2n}$. However, despite extensive effort over more than six decades, no stronger general lower bound had been established. In this paper, we obtain the new bound $$ f(n) \ge 2\sqrt{n}. $$This gives the first improvement of the classical lower bound for the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres problem in the general case since 1959.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cilleruelo conjectured that for an irreducible polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[X]$ of degree $d \geq 2$, denoting $$L_f(N)=\mathrm{lcm}(f(1),f(2),\ldots f(N))$$ one has $$\log L_f(n)\sim(d-1)N\log N.$$ He proved it in the case $d=2$ but it remains open for every polynomial with $d>2$. While the tight upper bound $\log L_f(n)\lesssim (d-1)N\log N$ is known, the best known general lower bound due to Sah is $\log L_f(n)\gtrsim N\log N.$ We give an improved lower bound for a special class of irreducible polynomials, which includes the decomposable irreducible polynomials $f=g\circ h,\,g,h\in\mathbb Z[x],\mathrm{deg}\, g,\mathrm{deg}\, h\ge 2$, for which we show $$\log L_f(n)\gtrsim \frac{d-1}{d-\mathrm{deg}\, g}N\log N.$$ We also improve Sah's lower bound $\log\ell_f(N)\gtrsim \frac 2dN\log N$ for the radical $\ell_f(N)=\mathrm{rad}(L_f(N))$ for all $f$ with $d\ge 3$ and give a further improvement for polynomials $f$ with a small Galois group and satisfying an additional technical condition, as well as for decomposable polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{D}(RC)$ be the derived category of representations of a small category $C$ over a commutative noetherian ring $R$. We study the homotopically smashing t-structures on this category. Specifying our discussion to the stalk categories $\Gamma_{\mathfrak{p}}\mathcal{D}(RQ)$ for a finite quiver $Q$ and a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $R$, we prove the telescope conjecture for the derived category of representations of finite quivers over artinian rings. More generally, we prove the same result also outside of the noetherian context, for representations of finite quivers over commutative perfect rings.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Chengming Bai, Li Guo, Guilai Liu, Quan Zhao &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical notion of splitting a binary quadratic operad $\mathcal{P}$ gives the notion of pre-$\mathcal{P}$-algebras characterized by $\mathcal{O}$-operators, with pre-Lie algebras as a well-known example. Pre-$\mathcal{P}$-algebras give a refinement of the structure of $\mathcal{P}$-algebras and is critical in the Manin triple approach to bialgebras for $\mathcal{P}$-algebras. Motivated by the new types of splitting appeared in recent studies, this paper aims to extend the classical notion of splitting, by relaxing the requirement that the adjoint actions of the pre-$\mathcal{P}$-algebra form a representation of the $\mathcal{P}$-algebra, to allow also linear combinations of the adjoint actions to form a representation. This yields a whole family of type-$M$ pre-structures, parameterized by the coefficient matrix $M$ of the linear combinations. Using the duals of the adjoint actions gives another family of splittings. Similar generalizations are given to the $\mathcal{O}$-operator characterization of the splitting, and to certain conditions on bilinear forms. Furthermore, this general framework is applied to determine the bialgebra structure induced from averaging Lie bialgebras, lifting the well-known fact that an averaging Lie algebra induces a Leibniz algebra to the level of bialgebras. This is achieved by interpreting the desired bialgebra structure for the Leibniz algebra as the one for a special type-$M$ pre-Leibniz algebra for a suitably chosen matrix $M$ in the above family.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the lonely runner conjecture holds for eight runners. Our proof relies on a computer verification and on recent results that allow bounding the size of a minimal counterexample. We note that our approach also applies to the known cases with 4, 5, 6, and 7 runners. We expect that minor improvements to our approach could be enough to solve the cases of 9 or 10 runners.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Edward Frenkel, David Hernandez &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 36 pages, v2: examples added in Section 6.1, to be published in the special issue of Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics in honor of Vyjayanthi Chari, v3: minor edits

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give an affirmative answer to a question asked by N. Moshchevitin \cite{m1} in his lecture at International Congress of Basic Science, Beijing, 2024 (see also \cite{m}, Section 6.3). The question is that whether the remainder $$ R_n=\sum_{j=1}^{2^n}\left(\xi_{j,n}-\frac{j}{2^n}\right)^2-2^n\int_0^1( ?(x)-x))^2\text{d}x $$ tends to $0$ when $n$ tends to infinity, where $\xi_{j,n}$ are elements of the Stern-Brocot sequence and $?(x)$ denotes Minkowski Question-Mark Function. We present some extended results and give a correct proof of a theorem on the Fourier-Stieltjes coefficient of the inverse function of $?(x)$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Pyry Kuusela &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** hep-th &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** v2: Clarified the role of twists, added a new appendix B.1, typos corrected, references added. The associated Mathematica package can be downloaded from https://github.com/PyryKuusela/CY3Zeta

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The deformation approach of arXiv:2104.07816 for computing zeta functions of one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds is generalised to cover also multiparameter manifolds. Consideration of the multiparameter case requires the development of an improved formalism. This allows us, among other things, to make progress on some issues left open in previous work, such as the treatment of apparent and conifold singularities and changes of coordinates. We also discuss the efficient numerical computation of the zeta functions. As examples, we compute the zeta functions of the two-parameter mirror octic, a non-symmetric split of the quintic threefold also with two parameters, and the $S_5$ symmetric five-parameter Hulek-Verrill manifolds. These examples allow us to exhibit the several new types of geometries for which our methods make practical computations possible. They also act as consistency checks, as our results reproduce and extend those of arXiv:hep-th/0409202 and arXiv:math/0304169. To make the methods developed here more approachable, a Mathematica package "CY3Zeta" for computing the zeta functions of Calabi-Yau threefolds, which is attached to this paper, is presented.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Volodymyr Mazorchuk, Shraddha Srivastava &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Comments Welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{P}_k(\delta)$, where $k$ is a positive integer and $\delta$ some complex parameter, be the classical partition algebra over the complex numbers. In the case when $\delta=n$, it is well-known that the algebra $\mathcal{P}_k(\delta)$ is the centralizer of the symmetric group $S_n$ acting on the $k$-fold tensor space of the natural representation of $S_n$, for $n\geq 2k$. The algebra $\mathcal{P}_k(\delta)$ is semi-simple for generic values of $\delta$. In this paper, we show that semi-simple partition algebras appear as the centralizer algebras for certain representations of the rook monoids given by an iterative restriction-induction of the trivial representation. Along the way, we also give a decomposition of this iterative representation of the rook monoid into various tensor spaces and show that the corresponding dimensions are given by generalized Bell numbers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Comments and suggestions are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that for any fixed integer \( n \geq 3 \) and nonzero integer \( m \), the proportion of integral binary forms of degree \( n \) that represent \( m \) tends to zero as the height tends to infinity. In fact, almost all such forms fail to represent \( m \). Our method uses lattice point counting and geometric methods, including Davenport's lemma and estimates for volumes of hyperplane sections of cubes, together with an analysis of the distribution of rational points on such hyperplanes. The result also holds when restricted to irreducible forms.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Revised following the comments. The computation of the constant multiple is significantly simplified, and some errors are corrected. Comments are very welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We explicitly construct the rank one primitive Stark (equivalently, Kolyvagin) system extending a constant multiple of Flach's zeta elements for semi-stable elliptic curves. As its arithmetic applications, we obtain the equivalence between a specific behavior of the Stark system and the minimal modularity lifting theorem, and we also discuss the cyclicity of the adjoint Selmer groups. This Stark system construction yields a more refined interpretation of the collection of Flach's zeta elements than the "geometric Euler system" approach due to Flach, Wiles, Mazur, and Weston.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages. Constructive comments are always welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the field of characteristic two, $\mathbb F_2.$ Denote by $GL(q)$ the general linear group of rank $q$ over $\mathbb F_2.$ The algebraic transfer, introduced by W. Singer [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523], is a rather effective tool for unraveling the intricate structure of the (mod-2) cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr A}^{q,*}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2).$ The Kameko homomorphism is one of the useful tools to study the dimension of the domain of the Singer transfer. Singer conjectured that the algebraic transfer is always a monomorphism, but this remains open for all homology degrees $q\geq 5.$ In this paper, by constructing a novel algorithm implemented in the computer algebra system OSCAR for computing $GL(q)$-invariants of the kernel of the Kameko homomorphism, we disprove Singer's conjecture for bidegree $(6,6+36).$</p></details>

> **Comment:** Typo in Thm. 1.4, eq. (1.21) fixed

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser recently considered a family of binomial determinants. In this work, we give combinatorial interpretations of two subclasses of these determinants in terms of domino tilings and nonintersecting lattice paths, thereby partially answering a question of theirs. Furthermore, the determinant evaluations established by Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser produce many product formulas for our weighted enumerations of domino tilings and nonintersecting lattice paths. However, there are still two enumerations left corresponding to conjectural formulas made by the three. We hereby prove the two conjectures using the principle of holonomic Ansatz plus the approach of modular reduction for creative telescoping, and hence fill the gap.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a Bridgeland stability condition on a 2-Calabi--Yau category, we define a simplicial complex that encodes the Harder--Narasimhan filtrations of spherical objects. For 2-Calabi--Yau categories of type A, we relate this complex to the complex of pointed pseudo-triangulations on configurations of points on the plane. Using this connection, we prove that the complex undergoes piecewise-linear wall-crossings as we vary the stability condition, and is piecewise-linearly homeomorphic to a sphere. Additionally, we prove that for a generic stability condition on a 2-Calabi--Yau category, a spherical object is determined by the ordered list of its Harder--Narasimhan factors.</p></details>

This is simultaneously finer, and requires weaker hypotheses, than the theory of Kolyvagin systems developed by Mazur and Rubin over discrete valuation rings and then by Sakamoto, Sano and the second author over Gorenstein rings. To illustrate its advantages, we prove new cases of Kato's generalised Iwasawa main conjecture for $\mathbb{Z}_p(1)$ and the $p$-adic Tate modules of rational elliptic curves, as well as of the Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjecture, and we also strengthen existing results on the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for CM elliptic curves.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we define a Grothendieck ring as a fusion ring categorifiable into a fusion category over the complex field. An integral fusion ring is called Drinfeld if all its formal codegrees are integers dividing the global Frobenius--Perron dimension. Every integral Grothendieck ring is necessarily Drinfeld. Using the fact that the formal codegrees of integral Drinfeld rings form an Egyptian fraction summing to 1, we derive a finite list of possible global FPdims for small ranks. Applying Normaliz, we classify all fusion rings with these candidate FPdims, retaining only those admitting a Drinfeld structure. To exclude Drinfeld rings that are not Grothendieck rings, we analyze induction matrices to the Drinfeld center, classified via our new Normaliz feature. Further exclusions and constructions involve group-theoretical fusion categories and Schur multipliers. Our main result is a complete classification of integral Grothendieck rings up to rank 5, extended to rank 7 in odd-dimensional and noncommutative cases using Frobenius--Schur indicators and Galois theory. Moreover, we show that any noncommutative, odd-dimensional, integral Grothendieck ring of rank at most 22 is pointed of rank 21. We also classify all integral 1-Frobenius Drinfeld rings of rank 6, identify the first known non-Isaacs integral fusion category (which turns out to be group-theoretical), classify integral noncommutative Drinfeld rings of rank 8, and integral 1-Frobenius MNSD Drinfeld rings of rank 9. Finally, we determine the smallest-rank exotic simple integral fusion rings: rank 4 in general, rank 6 in the Drinfeld case, and rank 7 in the 1-Frobenius Drinfeld case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study isolated quotient singularities by finite and linearly reductive group schemes (lrq singularities for short) and show that they satisfy many, but not all, of the known properties of finite quotient singularities in characteristic zero: (1) From the lrq singularity we can recover the group scheme and the quotient presentation. (2) We establish canonical lifts to characteristic zero, which leads to a bijection between lrq singularities and certain characteristic zero counterparts. (3) We classify subgroup schemes of ${\mathbf{GL}}_d$ and ${\mathbf{SL}}_d$ that correspond to lrq singularities. For $d=2$, this generalises results of Klein, Brieskorn, and Hashimoto. Also, our classification is closely related to the spherical space form problem. (4) F-regular (resp. F-regular and Gorenstein) surface singularities are precisely the lrq singularities by finite and linearly reductive subgroup schemes of ${\mathbf{GL}}_2$ (resp. ${\mathbf{SL}}_2$). This generalises results of Klein and Du Val. (5) Lrq singularities in dimension $\geq 4$ are infinitesimally rigid. We classify lrq singularities in dimension $3$ that are not infinitesimally rigid and compute their deformation spaces. This generalises Schlessinger's rigidity theorem to positive and mixed characteristic. Finally, we study Riemenschneider's conjecture in this context, that is, whether lrq singularities deform to lrq singularities.</p></details>

We use quantum versions of the de Rham and Koszul complexes, and compute their homologies.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The distribution of the properly renormalized gaps of $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ with $n < N$ converges (when $N\rightarrow \infty$) to a non-standard limit distribution, as Elkies and McMullen proved in 2004 using techniques from homogeneous dynamics. In this paper we give an essentially self-contained proof based on the circle method. Our main innovation consists in showing that a new type of correlation functions of $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ converge. To define these correlation functions we restrict, smoothly, to those $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ that lie in minor arcs, i.e. away from rational numbers with small denominators.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we compute the Gan-Gross-Prasad period integral of Klingen Eisenstein series over the unitary group $\mathrm{U}(m+1, n+1)$ with a cuspidal automorphic form over $\mathrm{U}(m+1, n)$, and show that it is related to certain special Rankin-Selberg $L$-values. We $p$-adically interpolate these Gan-Gross-Prasad period integrals as the Klingen Eisenstein series and the cuspidal automorphic form vary in Hida families. As a byproduct, we obtain a $p$-adic $L$-function of Rankin-Selberg type over $\mathrm{U}(m,n) \times \mathrm{U}(m+1, n)$. The ultimate motivation is to show the $p$-primitive property of Klingen Eisenstein series over unitary groups, by computing such Gan-Gross-Prasad period integrals, and this article is a starting point of this project. The $p$-primitivity of Eisenstein series is an essential property in the automorphic method in Iwasawa theory.</p></details>

The Jacobian algebra $A(T):=\mathcal{P}(Q(T), W(T))$ corresponding to the non-degenerate potential $W(T)$ defined by Cerulli Irelli and the second author is tame, as shown by Schr\"{o}er and the first two authors. In this paper, we show that there is a natural isomorphism $\pi_T:\mathrm{Lam}(\boldsymbol{\Sigma})\rightarrow\mathrm{DecIrr}^\tau(A(T))$ of tame partial KRS-monoids that intertwines dual shear coordinates with respect to $T$, and generic $g$-vectors of irreducible components. Here, $\mathrm{Lam}(\boldsymbol{\Sigma})$ is the set of laminations of $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ considered by Musiker-Schiffler-Williams, with the disjoint union of non-intersecting laminations as partial monoid operation. On the other hand, $\mathrm{DecIrr}^\tau(A(T))$ denotes the set of generically $\tau$-regular irreducible components of the decorated representation varieties of $A(T)$, with the direct sum of generically $E$-orthogonal irreducible components as partial monoid operation, where $E$ is the symmetrized $E$-invariant of Derksen-Weyman-Zelevinsky, $E(-,\bullet)=\dim\mathrm{Hom}_{A(T)}(-,\tau(\bullet))+\dim\mathrm{Hom}_{A(T)}(\bullet,\tau(-))$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 13 pages. Comments welcomed

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In \cite{Broer1993}, it was shown that certain line bundles on $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}}=T^*G/B$ have vanishing higher cohomology. We prove a generalization of this theorem for real reductive groups in the case when $G$ is adjoint. More specifically, if $\mathcal{N}_\theta$ denotes the cone of nilpotent elements in a Cartan subspace $\mathfrak{p},$ we have a similar construction of a resolution of singularities $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}.$ We prove that for a certain cone of weights $H^i(\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta},\mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}}(\lambda))=0$ for $i> 0.$ This follows by combining a simple calculation of the canonical bundle for $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}$ with Grauert-Riemanshneider vanishing. We use this to show that for groups of QCT (Definition 2), $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{N}_\theta]$ is equivalent as a $K$-representation to a certain cohomologically induced module giving a new proof of a result in \cite{KostantRallis1971}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Allen, Grove, Long, and Tu proposed an explicit Hypergeometric-Modularity method which gives a concrete link between certain hypergeometric objects and modular forms. The theory is exemplified by a collection of 199 weight 3 modular forms. Among other properties their process shows that the $L$-value of such a modular form at 1 is an explicit multiple of a ${}_3F_2(1)$ hypergeometric series. Using the framework of a finite Coxeter group governing the invariance group of normalized ${}_3F_2(1)$ series, this paper fully classifies and describes the possible Hecke eigenforms whose $L$-values that can be obtained using this method. In addition, we determine when these modular forms differ by twist of a finite-order character using the perspective of hypergeometric functions. As one application, we reinterpret a classical identity of hypergeometric series as a formula involving $L$-values of two Hecke eigenforms that differ by a twist.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Rooted trees are essential for describing numerical schemes via the so-called B-series. They have also been used extensively in rough analysis for expanding solutions of singular Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs). When one considers scalar-valued equations, the most efficient combinatorial set is multi-indices. In this paper, we investigate the existence of intermediate combinatorial sets that will lie between multi-indices and rooted trees. We provide a negative result stating that there is no combinatorial set encoding elementary differentials in dimension $d\neq 1$, and compatible with the rooted trees and the multi-indices aside from the rooted trees. This does not close the debate of the existence of such combinatorial sets, but it shows that it cannot be obtained via a naive and natural approach.</p></details>

We construct an indecomposable group scheme $\Xi_p$ over ${\mathbf Z}[\frac{1}{p}]$ of exponent 2 with field of points $M_u$. Assume that $A$ is prosaic, with bad reduction at only one prime $p$. Then $p \equiv 1 \bmod{8}$ and $A$ is totally toroidal at $p$. We prove that if End $A={\mathbf Z}$, then there is a ${\mathbf Q}$-isogenous abelian variety $B$ such that $B[2]$ is a subquotient of $\Xi_p$. We thereby show that $2g+2 \le h_2$ and $p$ has the form $a^2+16b^2$, with $a+4b \equiv \pm 1 \bmod{8}$. Moreover, if $2g + 4 \le h_2$, then $p$ has the form $a^2+64b^2$, with $a \equiv \pm 1 \bmod{8}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a non-Archimedean local field $F$ of residue cardinality $q=p^r$, we give an explicit classical generator $V$ for the bounded derived category $D_{fg}^b(\mathsf{H}_1(G))$ of finitely generated unipotent representations of $G=\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $l\neq p$. The generator $V$ has an explicit description that is much simpler than any known progenerator in the underived setting. This generalises a previous result of the author in the case where $n=2$ and $l$ is odd dividing $q+1$, and provides a triangulated equivalence between $D_{fg}^b(\mathsf{H}_1(G))$ and the category of perfect complexes over the dg algebra of dg endomorphisms of a projective resolution of $V$. This dg algebra can be thought of as a dg-enhanced Schur algebra. As an intermediate step, we also prove the analogous result for the case where $F$ is a finite field.</p></details>

In particular, we show that under some condition on $a$ and $b$, there are finitely many such functions generating the field of all modular functions on the congruence subgroup $\Gamma_1(10)$. Furthermore, we establish certain arithmetic properties of the function $l(\tau)=r(2\tau)/r(\tau)^2$, which can be used to evaluate these products. We employ the methods of Lee and Park, and some properties of $\eta$-quotients and generalized $\eta$-quotients to prove our results.</p></details>

We prove an explicit relative trace formula, which is flexible for the counting problem. Using a large sieve inequality developed by the first author and Voskou, we prove a new bound in mean square for the error term of order $O(X^{1/2}\log X)$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a prime $p$, the $p$-adic Littlewood Conjecture stands as a well-known arithmetic variant of the celebrated Littlewood Conjecture in Diophantine Approximation. In the same way as the latter, it admits a natural function field analogue depending on the choice of an irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ with coefficients in a field $\mathbb{K}$. This analogue is referred to as the $P(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture ($P(t)$-LC for short). $P(t)$-LC is proved to fail for any choice of irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ over any ground field $\mathbb{K}$ with characteristic $ \ell \equiv 3\pmod{4}$. The counterexample refuting it is shown to present a local arithmetic obstruction emerging from the fact that -1 is not a quadratic residue modulo a prime $\ell\equiv 3\pmod{4}$. The theory developed elucidates and generalises all previous approaches towards refuting the conjecture. They were all based on the computer-assisted method initiated by Adiceam, Nesharim and Lunnon (2021) which has been able to establish that $P(t)$-LC fails in some small characteristics (essentially up to 11). This computer-assisted method is, however, unable to provide a general statement as it relies on ad hoc computer verifications which, provided they terminate, refute $P(t)$--LC in a given characteristic. This limitation is overcome by exhibiting an arithmetic obstruction to the validity of $P(t)$--LC in infinitely many characteristics.This leaves the remaining case of odd characteristics $\ell\equiv 1\pmod{4}$ dependent on their full determination.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the hyperrigidity of subsets of unital $C^*$-algebras annihilated by states (or, more generally, by completely positive maps). This is closely related to the concept of rigidity at $0$ introduced by G. Salomon, who studied hyperrigid subsets of Cuntz and Cuntz-Krieger algebras. The absence of the unit in a hyperrigid set allows for the existence of $R$-dilations with non-isometric $R$. The existence of such an $R$-dilation forces the state annihilating the hyperrigid set to be a character. Using a dilation-theoretic approach, we provide multiple equivalent criteria for hyperrigidity involving intertwining relations for representations, valid in both commutative and noncommutative settings. We develop structural models for such dilations via orthogonal decompositions into two or three components, determined by defect operators and generalized eigenspaces associated with underlying representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the following statement about any Siegel modular form $F$ of degree $n$ and arbitrary odd level $N$ on the group $\Gamma_1^{(n)}(N)$. Let $A(F,T)$ denote the Fourier coefficients of $F$ and write $T=(T(i,j))$. Suppose that $F$ has a non-zero Fourier coefficient $A(F,T_0)$ such that $(T_0(n,n),N)=1$. Then there exist infinitely many odd and square-free (and thus fundamental) integers $m$ such that $m=\mathrm{discriminant}(T)$ and $A(F,T)\neq 0$. In the case of odd degrees, we prove a stronger result by replacing odd and square-free with odd and prime. We also prove quantitative results towards this.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate 3-nondegenerate CR structures in the lowest possible dimension 7 and show that 8 is the maximal dimension for the Lie algebra of symmetries of such structures. The next possible symmetry dimension is 6, and for the automorphism groups the dimension 7 is also realizable. This part (II) is devoted to the case where the symmetry algebra acts intransitively. We use various methods to bound its dimension and demonstrate the existence of infinitely many non-equivalent submaximally symmetric models. Summarizing, we get a stronger form of Beloshapka's conjecture on the symmetry dimension of hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^4$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a sequence of cyclotomic integers (Gaussian periods) of particularly small Mahler measure/height. We study the asymptotics of their Mahler measure as a function of their conductor, to find that the growth rate is the (multivariate) Mahler measure of a family of log Calabi-Yau varieties of increasing dimension. In turn, we study the asymptotics of some of these Mahler measures as the dimension increases, as well as properties of the associated algebraic dynamical system. We describe computational experiments that suggest that these cyclotomic integers realise the smallest non-zero logarithmic Mahler measure in the set of algebraic integers with cyclic Galois group of a given odd order. Finally, we discuss some precise conjectures that imply double logarithmic growth for those Mahler measures as a function of that order. The proofs use ideas from the theory of quantitative equidistribution, reflexive polytopes and toric varieties, the theory of random walks, Bessel functions, class field theory, and Linnik's constant.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a matrix $A \in Z^{k \times n}$ of rank $k$, the diagonal Frobenius number $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ is defined as the minimum $t \in Z_{\geq 1}$, such that, for any $b \in \text{span}_{Z}(A)$, the condition \begin{equation*} \exists x \in R_{\geq 0}^n,\, x \geq t \cdot 1 \colon \quad b = A x \end{equation*} implies that \begin{equation*} \exists z \in Z_{\geq 0}^n \colon\quad b = A z. \end{equation*} In this work, we show that \begin{equation*} F_{\text{diag}}(A) = \Delta + O(\log k), \end{equation*} where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum absolute value of $k \times k$ sub-determinants of $A$. From the computational complexity perspective, we show that the integer vector $z$ can be found by a polynomial-time algorithm for some weaker values of $t$ in the described condition. For example, we can choose $t = O( \Delta \cdot \log k)$ or $t = \Delta + O(\sqrt{k} \cdot \log k)$. Additionally, in the assumption that a $2^k$-time preprocessing is allowed or a base $J$ with $|{\det A_{J}}| = \Delta$ is given, we can choose $t = \Delta + O(\log k)$. Finally, we define a more general notion of the diagonal Frobenius number for slacks $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$, which is a generalization of $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ for canonical-form systems, like $A x \leq b$. All the proofs are mainly done with respect to $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$. The proof technique uses some properties of the Gomory's corner polyhedron relaxation and tools from discrepancy theory.</p></details>

These discriminants are related to a classical question of Eisenstein and have connections to the class groups of orders in quadratic fields as well as to real cubic fields. We present numerical computations of Eisenstein discriminants up to $10^{11}$, suggesting that their counting function up to $x$ is approximated by $\pi_{\mathcal{E}}(x) \approx \frac{1}{3\pi^2}x - 0.024x^{5/6}$. This supports a conjecture of Stevenhagen while revealing a surprising secondary term, which is similar to (but subtly different from) the secondary term in the counting function of real cubic fields.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The periodic Temperley-Lieb category consists of connectivity diagrams drawn on a ring with $N$ and $N'$ nodes on the outer and inner boundary, respectively. We consider families of modules, namely sequences of modules $\mathsf{M}(N)$ over the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra for varying values of $N$, endowed with an action $\mathsf{M}(N') \to \mathsf{M}(N)$ of the diagrams. Examples of modules that can be organised into families are those arising in the RSOS model and in the XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain, as well as several others constructed from link states. We construct a fusion product which outputs a family of modules from any pair of families. Its definition is inspired from connectivity diagrams drawn on a disc with two holes. It is thus defined in a way to describe intermediate states in lattice correlation functions. We prove that this fusion product is a bifunctor, and that it is distributive, commutative, and associative.</p></details>

In doing so, we prove two explicit presentations for the quantum $K$-ring of the flag variety, resolving conjectures of Gu-Sharpe-Mihalcea-Xu-Zhang-Zou and Rimanyi-Tarasov-Varchenko. We also prove that the stable map and quasimap $K$-theory of the partial flag varieties are isomorphic, using the work of Koroteev-Pushkar-Smirnov-Zeitlin identifying the latter ring with the Bethe algebra of the 5-vertex lattice model. Our isomorphism gives an additional interpretation of the quantum tautological bundles described in the quasimap ring.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent years, significant progress has been made on Mazur's Program B, with many authors beginning a systematic classification of all possible images of $p$-adic Galois representations attached to elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$. Currently, the classification is only complete for $p \in \{2,3,13,17\}$. The main difficulty for other primes arises from the need to understand elliptic curves whose mod-$p^n$ Galois representations are contained in the normaliser of a non-split Cartan subgroup. Equivalently, this amounts to determining the rational points on the modular curves $X_{ns}^+(p^n)$. Here, we consider the case $p=7$ and show that the modular curve $X_{ns}^+(49)$, of genus 69, has no non-CM rational points. To achieve this, we establish a correspondence between the rational points on $X_{ns}^+(49)$ and the primitive integer solutions of the generalised Fermat equation $a^2 + 28b^3 = 27 c^7$, the resolution of which can be reduced to determining the rational points of several genus-three curves. Furthermore, we reduce the complete classification of $7$-adic images to the determination of the rational points of a single plane quartic.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 102 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use the theory of reduced determinant functors from [24] to give a new, computationally useful, description of the relative $K_0$-groups of orders in finite dimensional separable algebras that need not be commutative. By combining this approach with a canonical generalization to non-commutative algebras of the notion of `zeta element' introduced by Kato [52], we then formulate, for each odd prime $p$, a natural main conjecture of non-commutative $p$-adic Iwasawa theory for $\mathbb{G}_m$ over arbitrary number fields. This conjecture predicts a simple relation between a canonical Rubin-Stark non-commutative Euler system that we introduce and the compactly supported $p$-adic cohomology of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and is shown to simultaneously extend both the higher rank (commutative) main conjecture for $\mathbb{G}_m$ formulated by Kurihara and the present authors [19] and the $K$-theoretical formalism of main conjectures in non-commutative Iwasawa theory developed by Ritter and Weiss [73] and by Coates, Fukaya, Kato, Sujatha and Venjakob [27]. In particular, via these links we obtain strong evidence in support of the conjecture in the setting of Galois CM extensions of totally real fields. Our approach also leads to the formulation over arbitrary number fields of a precise conjectural `higher derivative formula' for the Rubin-Stark non-commutative Euler system that is shown to recover upon appropriate specialisation the classical Gross-Stark Conjecture for Deligne-Ribet $p$-adic $L$-functions. We then show that this conjectural derivative formula can be combined with the main conjecture of non-commutative $p$-adic Iwasawa theory to give a strategy for obtaining evidence in support of the equivariant Tamagawa Number Conjecture for $\mathbb{G}_m$ over arbitrary finite Galois extensions of number fields, thereby obtaining a wide-ranging generalization of the main result of [19].</p></details>

More specifically, we have shown that if $p \equiv 7, 23 \pmod {40}$, then the rank of $E_{p}$ is zero for both $ \mathbb{Q} $ and $ \mathbb{Q}(i) $. Furthermore, if the prime $ p $ is of the form $ 40k_1 + 3 $ or $ 40k_2 + 27$, where $k_1, k_2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $(5k_1+1)$ or $(5k_2 +4)$ are perfect squares, then the given family of elliptic curves has rank one over $\mathbb{Q}$ and rank two over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$. Moreover, if the prime $ p $ is of the form $ 40k_3 + 11 $ or $ 40k_4 + 19$ where $k_3 ~\text{and}~ k_4 \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $(160k_3+49)$ or $(160k_4 + 81) $ are perfect squares, then the given family of elliptic curves has rank at least one over $\mathbb{Q}$ and rank at least two over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article contributes to the study of the generic part of the cohomology of Shimura varieties. Under a mild restriction of the characteristic of the coefficient field, we prove a torsion vanishing result for Shimura varieties of abelian type, confirming a conjecture by Hamann--Lee. Our proofs utilize the unipotent categorical local Langlands correspondence and, in contrast to previous works, do not rely on the endoscopic classification of representations or on other results established through trace formula techniques.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11581v1'>2509.11581</a>\]&nbsp; **Dual Shellability of Admissible Set and Cohen-Macaulayness of Local Models**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Xuhua He, Qingchao Yu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove G\"ortz's combinatorial conjecture \cite{Go01} on dual shellability of admissible sets in Iwahori-Weyl groups, proving that the augmented admissible set $\widehat{\mathrm{Adm}}(\mu)$ is dual shellable for any dominant coweight $\mu$. This provides a uniform, elementary approach to establishing Cohen-Macaulayness of the special fibers of the local models with Iwahori level structure for all reductive groups-including residue characteristic $2$ and non-reduced root systems-circumventing geometric methods. Local models, which encode singularities of Shimura varieties and moduli of shtukas, have seen extensive study since their introduction by Rapoport-Zink, with Cohen-Macaulayness remaining a central open problem. While previous work relied on case-specific geometric analyses (e.g., Frobenius splittings \cite{HR23} or compactifications \cite{He13}), our combinatorial proof yields an explicit labeling that constructs the special fiber by sequentially adding irreducible components while preserving Cohen-Macaulayness at each step, a new result even for split groups.</p></details>
