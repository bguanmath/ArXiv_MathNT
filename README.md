 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Benjamin Bedert, Matija Bucić, Noah Kravitz, Richard Montgomery, Alp Müyesser &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A sequence $s_1,s_2,\ldots, s_k$ of elements of a group $G$ is called a valid ordering if the partial products $s_1, s_1 s_2, \ldots, s_1\cdots s_k$ are all distinct. A long-standing problem in combinatorial group theory asks whether, for a given group $G$, every subset $S \subseteq G\setminus \{\mathrm{id}\}$ admits a valid ordering; the instance of the additive group $\mathbb{F}_p$ is the content of a well-known 1971 conjecture of Graham. Most partial progress to date has concerned the edge cases where either $S$ or $G \setminus S$ is quite small. Our main result is an essentially complete resolution of the problem for $G=\mathbb{F}_2^n$: we show that there is an absolute constant $C>0$ such that every subset $S\subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n \setminus \{0\}$ of size at least $C$ admits a valid ordering. Our proof combines techniques from additive and probabilistic combinatorics, including the Freiman--Ruzsa theorem and the absorption method. Along the way, we also solve the general problem for moderately large subsets: there is a constant $c>0$ such that for every group $G$ (not necessarily abelian), every subset $S \subseteq G\setminus \{\mathrm{id}\}$ of size at least $|G|^{1-c}$ admits a valid ordering. Previous work in this direction concerned only sets of size at least $(1-o(1))|G|$. A main ingredient in our proof is a structural result, similar in spirit to the Arithmetic Regularity Lemma, showing that every Cayley graph can be efficiently decomposed into mildly quasirandom components.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a geometric proof of inverse Hamiltonian reduction for all finite W-algebras in type $A$, a certain embedding of the finite W-algebra corresponding to an arbitrary nilpotent in $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ into that corresponding to a larger nilpotent with respect to the closure order on orbits, tensored with an auxiliary algebra of differential operators. We first prove a classical analogue for equivariant Slodowy slices using multiplication maps on generalized slices in the affine Grassmannian, then deduce the result for equivariant finite W-algebras by Fedosov quantization. This implies the statement for finite W-algebras, as well as Kostant-Whittaker reductions of arbitrary algebras in the category of Harish Chandra bimodules, including quantizations of Moore-Tachikawa varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a geometric proof of inverse Hamiltonian reduction for all affine W-algebras in type A at generic level, a certain embedding of the affine W-algebra corresponding to an arbitrary nilpotent in $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ into that corresponding to a larger nilpotent with respect to the closure order on orbits, tensored with an auxiliary algebra of free fields. We proceed by constructing strict chiral quantizations of equivariant Slodowy slices, sheaves of $\hbar$-adic vertex algebras on the arc spaces of the slices, and then localizing them on quasi-Darboux open sets. We also provide a generalization for the Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction of arbitrary vertex algebra objects in the Kazhdan-Lusztig category.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Carlos E. Arreche, Matthew W. Babbitt &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $\tau$ the translation automorphism defined by a non-torsion point in an elliptic curve, we consider the elliptic summability problem of deciding whether a given elliptic function $f$ is of the form $f=\tau(g)-g$ for some elliptic function $g$. We introduce two new panorbital residues and show that they, together with the orbital residues introduced in 2018 by Dreyfus, Hardouin, Roques, and Singer, comprise a complete obstruction to the elliptic summability problem. The underlying elliptic curve can be described in any of the usual ways: as a complex torus, as a Tate curve, or as a one-dimensional abelian variety. We develop the necessary results from scratch intrinsically within each setting; in the last two of them, we also work in arbitrary characteristic. We include several basic concrete examples of computation of orbital and panorbital residues for some summable and non-summable functions in each setting. We conclude by applying the technology of orbital and panorbital residues to obtain several new results of independent interest.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We extend a result of Bump et al. to show that a large family of Sheffer sequences has their zeros - up to perhaps a finite number of exceptions - on a vertical line. We connect a particular such sequence to the Riemann zeta function via a product representation of a scaled Mellin transform, analogously to the product decomposition of a Mellin transform involving the generalized Laguerre polynomials into factors of the Gamma function and Meixner polynomials.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $R_{\alpha}$ being an irrational rotation of angle $\alpha$ on the one torus $\mathbb{T}$ and $\phi(x)=\frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{1-x}$, we compare the behavior of the Birkhoff sum $S_N(\phi)=\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}(\phi\circ R_{\alpha}^k)(x)$ with the successive entry $(\phi\circ R_{\alpha}^N)(x)$. In particular, we are interested in the almost sure limsup behavior of $\frac{(\phi\circ R_{\alpha}^N)(x)}{S_N(\phi)(x)}$. We show that depending on the Diophantine properties of $\alpha$ we have that the limsup either equals $0$ or $\infty$. Moreover, we show that those $\alpha$ for which the limsup equals $0$ form an atypical set in the sense that its Hausdorff dimension equals $\frac{1}{2}$. These results have consequences in studying a reparametrization $(T_t)$ of the linear flow $(L_t)$ with direction $(1,\alpha)$ on the two torus $\mathbb{T}^2$ with function $\varphi$, where $\varphi$ is a smooth non-negative function that has exactly two (non-degenerate) zeros at $\bf p$ and $\bf q$. We prove that for a full measure set $(\alpha, {\bf p}, {\bf q})\in \mathbb{T}\times \mathbb{T}^2\times \mathbb{T}^2$ the special flow $(T_t)$ exhibits extreme historic behavior proving a conjecture given by Andersson and Guih\'eneuf.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the Kauffman bracket skein module of a closed Seifert fibered 3-manifold $M$ is finitely generated over $\mathbb Z[A^{\pm 1}]$ if and only if $M$ is irreducible and non-Haken. We analyze in detail the character varieties $X(M)$ of such manifolds and show that under mild conditions they are reduced. We compute the Kauffman bracket skein modules for these $3$-manifolds (over $\mathbb Q(A)$) and show that their dimensions coincide with $|X(M)|.$</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Vladimir Gurvich, Mariya Naumova &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A number $N$ is a triangular number if it can be written as $N = t(t + 1)/2$ for some nonnegative integer number $t$. A triangular number $N$ is called square if it is a perfect square, that is, $N = d^2$ for some integer number $d$. Square triangular numbers were characterized by Euler in 1778 and are in one-to-one correspondence with the so-called near-isosceles Pythagorean triples $(k,k+1,l)$, where $k^2 + (k+1)^2 = l^2$. A quadratic number is the product $\Pi = \Pi(k,j) = k(k+1)(k+j)(k+j+1)$ for some nonnegative integer numbers $k$ and $j$. By definition, it is the product of two triangular numbers and 4. Quadratic number $\Pi$ and the corresponding pair $(k,j)$ are called square if $\Pi$ is a perfect square. Clearly, $(k,j)$ is square if both triangular numbers $k(k+1)/2$ and $(k+j)(k+j+1)/2$ are perfect squares. Yet, there exist infinitely many other square quadratic numbers. We construct polynomials $j_i(k)$ of degree $i$ with positive integer coefficients satisfying equations: $k + j_{2 \ell}(k) + 1 = k [a_\ell k^\ell + \dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 +1 = (k+1) [b_\ell k^\ell + \dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ and \newline $k + j_{2\ell+1}(k) + 1 = k(k+1) [a_\ell k^\ell + \dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 + 1 = [b_{\ell+1} k^{\ell+1}+b_\ell k^\ell + \dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ for some positive integer $\ell$ and some coefficients $a_i, b_j$, $i=0, \ldots, \ell, j=0, \ldots, \ell+1$. All the obtained pairs $(k, j_i(k))$ are square. We conjecture that the products of square triangular numbers and pairs $(k, j_i(k))$ cover all quadratic squares. Additionally, we identify pairs of intervals of successive integers with equal sums of squares.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 8 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that if the smallest modulus of a covering system with distinct moduli is $5$, then the largest modulus is at least 108. We also prove that if the smallest modulus of a covering system with distinct moduli is $5$, then the least common multiple of the moduli is at least 1440. Finally, we prove that if the smallest modulus of a covering system with distinct moduli is 6, then the least common multiple of the moduli is at least $5040$. The constants $108$, $1440$ and $5040$ are best possible. This resolves a conjecture of Krukenberg, a problem of Dalton and Trifonov, and a generalization thereof.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, we showed that for every irrational number $\alpha$, there exist infinitely many positive integers $n$ represented by any given positive definite binary quadratic form $Q$, satisfying $||\alpha n||<n^{-(1/2-\varepsilon)}$ for any fixed but arbitrarily small $\varepsilon>0$. We also provided a quantitative version with a lower bound when the exponent $1/2-\varepsilon$ is replaced by weaker exponent $\gamma<3/7-\varepsilon$. In this article we recover this quantitative version with the exponent $1/2-\varepsilon$, but now for the particular case of sums of two squares.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a new approach to address some classical questions concerning the size and structure of integer distance sets. Our main result is that any integer distance set in the Euclidean plane is either very sparse or has all but an exceedingly small proportion of its points lying on a single line or circle. From this, we deduce a near-optimal lower bound on the diameter of any non-collinear integer distance set of size $n$ and a strong upper bound on the size of any integer distance set in $[-N,N]^2$ with no three points on a line and no four points on a circle.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 22 pages; v2: expanded the section on G2 to include all tempered L-packets, added remarks in the introduction, additional references, corrections; v3: added details for the calculation of the Spaltenstein duality, and fully verified the conjectures in the case of G2

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an irreducible smooth representation of a connected reductive $p$-adic group, two important associated invariants are the wavefront set and the (partly conjectural) Langlands parameter. While a wavefront set consists of $p$-adic nilpotent orbits, one constituent of the Langlands parameter is a complex nilpotent orbit in the dual Lie algebra. For unipotent representations in the sense of Lusztig, the corresponding nilpotent orbits on the two sides are related via the Lusztig--Spaltenstein duality, by the work of Ciubotaru--Mason-Brown--Okada. In this paper, we formulate a general upper-bound conjecture and several variants relating the nilpotent orbits that appear in the wavefront set and in the Langlands parameter. We also verify these expectations in some cases, including the depth-zero supercuspidal representations of classical groups and all the irreducible representations of $G_2$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Revised the abstract to better reflect the updated scope of the work and key conclusions. This update refines the mathematical conclusions of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $a$ and $b$ be relatively prime integers. Then the first Lucas sequence $\left(U_n\right)_{n\geq0}$ and the second Lucas sequence $\left(V_n\right)_{n\geq0}$ are defined respectively by $U_{n+2}=aU_{n+1}+bU_{n},\, U_0=0,\,U_1=1$ and $V_{n+2}=aV_{n+1}+bV_{n},\, V_0=2,\,V_1=a$, where $n\geq0$. Let $m$ be an integer with $\gcd(m,\,b)=1$. Then the smallest positive integer $k$ satisfying $m\mid U_k$ is called the order of appearance of $m$ in the first Lucas sequence $(U_n)_{n\geq0}$, denoted by $\tau(m)$, i.e., $\tau(m):=\min\{k\geq1:m\mid U_k\}$. When $a>0$ and $\Delta=a^2+4b>0$, we give explicit formulae for $\tau(U_m V_n), \tau(U_m U_n)$, $\tau(V_m V_n)$ and $\tau(U_nU_{n+p}U_{n+2p})$, thus generalizing the results of Irmak and Ray.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Waring's Problem asks whether, for each positive integer $k$, there exists an integer $s$ such that every positive integer is a sum of at most $k$th powers. While Hilbert proved the existence of such $s$, Waring's Problem has lead to areas of related work, namely the function $g(k)$, which denotes the least such $s$. There is no known general closed form for $g(k)$, though for $g(k)$ has been evaluated for small $k$. Prior work has reduced the problem to verifying a particular condition, which if never occurs, implies an expression for $g(k)$. In this paper, I present a proof the condition never occurs, thus fixing the value of $g(k)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 31 pages, accepted version. Note that there is a mistake in Theorem 7.3 (thanks to Andrew Fisher and Daniel Graves for finding it!)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper provides a systematization of some recent results in homology of algebras. Our main theorem gives criteria under which the homology of a diagram algebra is isomorphic to the homology of the subalgebra on diagrams having the maximum number of left-to-right connections. From this theorem, we deduce the `invertible-parameter' cases of the Temperley-Lieb and Brauer results of Boyd-Hepworth and Boyd-Hepworth-Patzt. We are also able to give a new proof of Sroka's theorem that the homology of an odd-strand Temperley-Lieb algebra vanishes, as well as an analogous result for Brauer algebras and an interpretation of both results in the even-strand case. Our proofs are relatively elementary: in particular, no auxiliary chain complexes or spectral sequences are required. We briefly discuss the relationship to cellular algebras in the sense of Graham-Lehrer.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the homology of the Jones annular algebras is isomorphic to that of the cyclic groups below a line of gradient $\frac{1}{2}$. We also show that the homology of the partition algebras is isomorphic to that of the symmetric groups below a line of gradient 1, strengthening a result of Boyd-Hepworth-Patzt. Both isomorphisms hold in a range exceeding the stability range of the algebras in question. Along the way, we prove the usual odd-strand and invertible parameter results for the Jones annular algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give non-trivial lower bounds for the border rank of families of $\mathbf{GL}(V)$-invariant tensors in $U\otimes \mathbf{S}_\lambda V\otimes \mathbf{S}_\mu V$ where $U$ is $V$, $\mathrm{Sym}^2V$ or $\bigwedge^2V$. We build on the techniques introduced by Wu, who used Young flattenings to obtain bounds for a family of tensors when $U$ is $V$. We complete this case by resolving a conjecture introduced by Wu, using certain pure resolutions constructed by Ford-Levinson-Sam. We then use a theorem of Kostant to generalise this to $\mathrm{Sym}^2 V$ and $\bigwedge^2 V$, and extend the number of examples of $\mathbf{GL}(V)$-invariant tensors that are not of minimal border rank using Kempf collapsing.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the existence of a new structure on the first Galois cohomology of generic families of symplectic self-dual $p$-adic representations of $G_{\mathbb{Q}_p}$ of rank two (a local sign decomposition): a functorial decomposition into free rank one Lagrangian submodules which encodes the $p$-adic variation of Bloch--Kato subgroups via completed epsilon constants, mirroring a symplectic structure. The local sign decomposition has diverse local as well as global arithmetic consequences. This includes compatibility of the Mazur--Rubin arithmetic local constant and completed epsilon constants, answering a question of Mazur and Rubin. The compatibility leads to new cases of the $p$-parity conjecture for Hilbert modular forms at supercuspidal primes $p$. We also formulate and prove an analogue of Rubin's conjecture over ramified quadratic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Using it, we construct an integral $p$-adic $L$-function for anticyclotomic deformation of a CM elliptic curve at primes $p$ ramified in the CM field.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let \((a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) be a lacunary sequence of integers satisfying the Hadamard gap condition. For any fixed dimension $d \geq 1$, we establish asymptotic upper bounds for the maximal gap in the set of dilates \(\{\boldsymbol{\alpha} a_n \}_{n \leq N}\) modulo 1 as $N \to \infty$, for Lebesgue--almost all dilation vectors $\boldsymbol{\alpha} \in [0,1]^d$. More precisely, we prove that for any lacunary \((a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) and Lebesgue--almost all $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$, every convex set in $[0,1]^d$ of volume at least $(\log N)^{2+\varepsilon}/N$ must contain an element of the set \(\{\boldsymbol{\alpha} a_n \}_{n \leq N}\) mod 1, for all sufficiently large $N$. We also establish a generalized version of this result, where the $d$-dimensional Lebesgue measure is replaced by a general measure satisfying a certain Fourier decay condition. Our result is optimal up to logarithmic factors, and recovers as a special case a recent result for dimension $d=1$.</p></details>

Our proof of this result for each $n \ge 4$ provides an explicit modulus $M$ such that the corresponding equation has no solution already modulo $M$.

This polynomial identity provides a generalization and a unified approach to the Schur and Lebesgue theorems. We discuss other analytic identities for the Lebesgue and Schur theorems and also provide a key identity ($q$-hypergeometric) for Andrews' deep refinement of the Alladi-Schur theorem. Finally, we discuss a new infinite hierarchy of identities, the first three of which relate to the partition theorems of Euler, Lebesgue, and Capparelli, and provide their polynomial versions as well.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The modular curves in the family $X_1(N)$ for natural numbers $N$ parametrize elliptic curves over the complex numbers with a distinguished point of order $N$. The purpose of this paper is to better understand how to calculate the degrees of points on $X_1(\ell^n)$ for a prime $\ell$ and arbitrary positive integer $n$. In analogy with the definition of the level of a Galois representation, we construct a new definition: the level of a fiber of a closed point on a modular curve. Using this definition, we prove that, under certain conditions, if the degree of a point on $X_1(\ell^{k+1})$ is as large as possible given the degree of its image on $X_1(\ell^k),$ then its lifts on $X_1(\ell^n)$ have degree as large as possible for all $n > k$. We prove this result using techniques inspired by work of Lang and Trotter which gives a similar result for the image of $\ell$-adic Galois representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G=G_{n}=GL(n)$ be the $n\times n$ complex general linear group and embed $G_{n-1}=GL(n-1)$ in the top left hand corner of $G$. The standard Borel subgroup of upper triangular matrices $B_{n-1}$ of $G_{n-1}$ acts on the flag variety of $G$ with finitely many orbits. In this paper, we show that each $B_{n-1}$-orbit is the intersection of orbits of two Borel subgroups of $G$ acting on the flag variety of $G$. This allows us to give a new combinatorial description of the $B_{n-1}$-orbits by associating to each orbit a pair of Weyl group elements. The closure relations for the $B_{n-1}$-orbits can then be understood in terms of the Bruhat order on the Weyl group, and the Richardson-Springer monoid action on the orbits can be understood in terms of the classical monoid action of the Weyl group on itself. This approach makes the closure relation more transparent than in earlier work of Magyar and the monoid action significantly more computable than in our earlier papers, and also allows us to obtain new information about the orbits including a simple formula for the dimension of an orbit.</p></details>

As a corollary, we show that for all $\varepsilon>0$, there exists an effectively computable constant $c>0$ depending only on $(n,n',[F:\mathbb{Q}],\varepsilon)$ such that $L(s,\pi\times\pi')$ has at most one zero (necessarily simple) in the region $$ \mathrm{Re}(s)\geq 1-c/(C(\pi)C(\pi')(|\mathrm{Im}(s)|+1))^{\varepsilon}, $$ where $C(\pi)$ and $C(\pi')$ are the analytic conductors. A crucial component of our proof is a new standard zero-free region for any twist of $L(s,\pi\times\widetilde{\pi})$ by an idele class character $\chi$ apart from a possible single exceptional zero (necessarily real and simple) that can occur only when $\pi\otimes\chi^2=\pi$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Mossinghoff, Trudgian, and the first author~\cite{MMT23} recently introduced a family of arithmetic functions called ``fake $\mu$'s'', which are multiplicative functions for which there is a $\{-1,0,1\}$-valued sequence $(\varepsilon_j)_{j=1}^{\infty}$ such that $f(p^j) = \varepsilon_j$ for all primes $p$. They investigated comparative number-theoretic results for fake $\mu$'s and in particular proved oscillation results at scale $\sqrt{x}$ for the summatory functions of fake $\mu$'s with $\varepsilon_1=-1$ and $\varepsilon_2=1$. In this paper, we establish new oscillation results for the summatory functions of all nontrivial fake $\mu$'s at scales $x^{1/2\ell}$ where $\ell$ is a positive integer (the ``critical index'') depending on $f$; for $\ell=1$ this recovers the oscillation results in~\cite{MMT23}. Our work also recovers results on the indicator functions of powerfree and powerfull numbers; we generalize techniques applied to each of these examples to extend to all fake $\mu$'s.</p></details>

Elkies and Speyer, answering a question by Dimitrov, showed there is a critical exponential growth threshold, such that there are infinitely many IVPs with growth above the threshold and finitely many IVPs below that threshold (of arbitrary degree). In this paper, we give more refined estimates for the number of IVPs having exponential growth thresholds. In addition, we consider a similar problem, where there is a (not necessarily symmetric) growth condition on the integers. Notably, the critical threshold is determined by the logarithmic capacity of an explicit domain.</p></details>

In particular, let $f$ be a nonnegative multiplicative function. We prove that if there exists a $\beta<1$ such that $f(p^l)\ll (\log\log x)^{l\beta}$ for every prime $p$ and every $l>1$, and if $f(n)\ll \max\{n^\epsilon,(\log x)^\epsilon\}$ for every $\epsilon>0$, then $$\sum_{\substack{x\leq n\leq x+y \\ n\equiv a\pmod k}}f(n)\ll \frac{x}{\phi(k)(\log x)^{1-\epsilon_0}}\exp\left(\sum_{\substack{p\leq x \\ p\nmid k}}\frac{f(p)}{p}\right)$$ for every $\epsilon_0>0$, where $x$, $y$, and $k$ are as they were in Shiu's original paper and $(a,k)=1$. Moreover, we prove that if $f$ is a $Q$-smooth-supported function then there exists a constant $C$ for which $$\sum_{\substack{x\leq n\leq x+y \\ n\equiv a\pmod k}}f(n)\ll \frac{x}{\phi(k)(\log x)^{1-\epsilon_0}}\exp\left(\sum_{\substack{p\leq x \\ p\nmid k}}\frac{f(p)}{p}\right)\rho(u)^C,$$ where $u=\frac{\log x}{\log Q}$, $\rho$ is the Dickman-de Bruijn function, and $C$ depends on whether we choose the bound of $f(p^l)\leq A_1^l$ or $f(p^l)\ll (\log\log x)^{l\beta}$. We also give applications to both the divisor function to large powers and to smooth numbers in short intervals.</p></details>

Then $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ acts on $S_2(\Gamma(p))$ in a natural way. Around 1928, Hecke proved that if $p>3$ and $p\equiv 3\mod 4$, then the class number of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-p})$ is equal to the difference between the multiplicities of two particular irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ in $S_2(\Gamma(p))$. In this paper we prove a Lie algebra analogue of this result. As an application we extend Hecke's result to $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/p^r)$ (acting on $S_2(\Gamma(p^r))$) for any $r\geq 2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A central conjecture of Coates and Sujatha predicts that the fine Selmer group of any $p$-adic Galois representation is cotorsion over the relevant Iwasawa algebra with vanishing $\mu$-invariant, generalizing Iwasawa's original conjecture for class groups. In this article, we recast this conjecture in terms of higher Galois cohomological operations called Massey products, stated purely in terms of the residual representation. This characterization implies that if the $\mu$-invariant vanishes for a given $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension, then it also vanishes for all $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions the Greenberg neighbourhood of radius $1/p$. Furthermore, we establish that the unobstructedness of ordinary deformation rings over $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions is equivalent to the vanishing of the $\mu$-invariant of the fine Selmer group attached to the adjoint representation. For ordinary deformation rings attached to $2$-dimensional automorphic Galois representations, we establish a close connection between the Noetherian property and the vanishing of the $\mu$-invariant.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma=0.577215\ldots$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta=0.596347\ldots$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that these two numbers are disjunctively transcendental; that is, at least one of them must be transcendental. The two constants are related through a well-known equation of Hardy, which recently has been generalized to a pair of infinite sequences $(\gamma^{\left(n\right)},\delta^{\left(n\right)})$ based on moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution. In the present work, we demonstrate the algebraic independence of the set $\{\gamma^{\left(n\right)}+\delta^{\left(n\right)}/e\}_{n\geq0}$, and thus the transcendence of $\gamma^{\left(n\right)}+\delta^{\left(n\right)}/e$ for all $n\geq0$. This further implies the disjunctive transcendence of both pairs $(\gamma^{\left(n\right)},\delta^{\left(n\right)}/e)$ and $(\gamma^{\left(n\right)},\delta^{\left(n\right)})$ for all $n\geq1$.</p></details>

We then prove that under certain conditions on a given basis of the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_F$, the existence of its well-rounded twist is equivalent to the existence of a principal well-rounded ideal in $K$. Applying the result and the algorithm, we explicitly compute well-rounded twists of the ring of integers for cyclic cubic fields in the families of Shanks, Washington, and Kishi. In addition, we show that infinitely many fields in Shanks's family have rings of integers that admit orthogonal well-rounded twists.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $R$ be the complete local ring of a complex plane curve germ and $S$ its normalization. We propose a "Hilb-vs-Quot" conjecture relating the virtual weight polynomials of the Hilbert schemes of $R$ to those of the Quot schemes that parametrize $R$-submodules of $S$. By relating the Quot side to a type of compactified Picard scheme, we show that our conjecture generalizes a conjecture of Cherednik's, and that it would relate the perverse filtration on the cohomology of the Picard side to a more elementary filtration. Next, we propose a Quot version of the Oblomkov-Rasmussen-Shende conjecture, relating parabolic refinements of our Quot schemes to Khovanov-Rozansky link homology. It becomes equivalent to the original version under (refined) Hilb-vs-Quot, but can also be strengthened to incorporate polynomial actions and $y$-ification. For germs $y^n = x^d$, where $n$ is either coprime to or divides $d$, we prove the Quot version of ORS through combinatorics. When $n = 3$ and $3 \nmid d$, we deduce Hilb-vs-Quot by an asymptotic argument, and hence, establish the original ORS conjecture for these germs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article we refer to "the BGG method" as a method in which by using Lie-algebra techniques one produces a complex of coherent sheaves on a Shimura variety, which is quasi-isomorphic to the de Rham complex of an automorphic vector bundle with integrable connection, on that Shimura variety. These BGG-complexes are in many ways "smaller" than the de Rham complex and have better cohomological properties. These BGG complexes contribute to the understanding of automorphic representations. In this article, we extend the BGG technique and apply it to complexes of Banach-modules with integrable connection on relevant open subspaces of Shimura varieties, seen as adic analytic spaces. Furthermore, we explain how this method can be used to obtain a new computation of the de Rham cohomology of certain p-adic automorphic representations in the GL_2 case.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Geil-Matsumoto bound (GM bound) constrains the number of rational points on a curve over a finite field in terms of the Weierstrass semigroup of any of the points on the curve. For general numerical semigroups, the GM bound lacks a simple closed-form expression, making its computation a challenging problem. A closed formula has been obtained for the case when the semigroup is generated by two co-prime integers. In this work, for any numerical semigroup, we provide a closed formula for the GM bound in terms of the Ap\'ery set of a nonzero element of the semigroup. In the case where the numerical semigroup is generated by consecutive integers $n, n+1, \dots, n+t$ with $\lceil\textstyle\frac{n-1}{2}\rceil\leq t \leq n-1$, we obtain a simple closed formula for the bound. We apply these results to obtain upper bounds on the number of rational points for algebraic curves over finite fields. In some cases, our bounds improve some well-known upper bounds on the number of rational points.</p></details>

Starting from the irreducible modules of the corresponding simple Bershadsky-Polyakov vertex operator algebras, we show that inverse reduction constructs all irreducible lower-bounded weight $\mathsf{A}_{2}(\mathsf{u},2)$-modules. This proceeds by first constructing a complete set of coherent families of fully relaxed highest-weight $\mathsf{A}_{2}(\mathsf{u},2)$-modules and then noting that the reducible members of these families degenerate to give all remaining irreducibles. Using this fully relaxed construction and the degenerations, we deduce modular S-transforms for certain natural generalised characters of these irreducibles and their spectral flows. With this modular data in hand, we verify that the (conjectural) standard Verlinde formula predicts Grothendieck fusion rules with nonnegative-integer multiplicities.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Representation theory of Lie (super)algebras has garnered significant research attention over many years, especially due to its applications in theoretical physics; in this regard, representation theory of affine Lie (super)algebras is of great importance. To characterize simple modules over affine Lie (super)algebras, we need to address the cases of nonzero and critical level separately. Although a vast amount of research exists on the representation theory of affine Lie (super)algebras, investigations regarding general modules at the critical level are few. In the current paper, we focus on twisted affine Lie superalgebras {$\LL$} ($\LL_1\neq \{0\}$). The even part of almost all such {$\LL$}'s contains two affine Lie algebras, and in turn, the behavior of the restricted modules corresponding to these affine components and their interactions play important roles in characterizing simple $\LL$-modules. In this paper, we deal with $\LL$-modules, at the critical level, for which only one of the restricted modules corresponding to the affine components of {$\LL_0$} is integrable. The results are important from two perspectives: first, we provide a characterization of a class of modules at the critical level, and second, we use this to characterize general modules at the critical level.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present new conditions which obstruct the existence of hyperelliptic Jacobians in isogeny classes of abelian varieties over finite fields of characteristic 2. We show that Weil polynomials of Jacobians cannot have coefficients in certain residue classes modulo 2, extending the approach of Costa et al. in arXiv:2002.02067. We prove that for 3- and 4-dimensional abelian varieties over $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$, as $n \rightarrow\infty$, the parities of the Weil coefficients asymptotically equidistribute. Further, we show that these obstructions disqualify $\frac12$ of all 3-dimensional isogeny classes and $\frac 58$ of all 4-dimensional isogeny classes from containing a hyperelliptic Jacobian. Additionally, we present a practical enumeration algorithm which generates all isomorphism classes of hyperelliptic curves of arbitrary genus over almost any finite field of characteristic 2 based on existing algorithms over $\mathbb{F}_2$. Our analysis shows the runtime to be $\tilde{{O}}(2^{n(2g-1)})$ expected, and $\tilde{{O}}(2^{n(2g+2)})$ worst case. This runtime improvement renders the algorithm practical for fields other than $\mathbb{F}_2$.</p></details>

We conjecture that two of these obstructions classify all isogeny classes asymptotically as $q \to \infty$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A random ensemble of cusp forms for the full modular group is introduced. For a weight-$k$ cusp form, restricted to a compact subdomain of the modular surface, the true order of magnitude of its expected supremum is determined to be $\asymp \sqrt{\log{k}}$, in line with the conjectured bounds. Additionally, the exponential concentration of the supremum around its median is established. Contrary to the compact case, it is shown that the global expected supremum, which is attained around the cusp, grows like $k^{1/4}$, up to a logarithmic factor.</p></details>

This improves on various previous results and is optimal, barring substantial progress on the twin prime or binary Goldbach conjectures. The proof is based on constructing a non-negative model for the Chen primes in a suitable approximate sense. To do this, we develop an efficient sieving strategy that makes use of a power-saving variant of the Bombieri--Vinogradov theorem. Furthermore, we show that the primes are well approximated in additive problems by the Cram\'er model (rough numbers) with a sifting parameter of power size.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this follow-up paper, we again inspect a surprising relationship between the set of $2$-periodic points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ and the coefficient $c$, where $K$ is any number field of degree $n\geq 2$ and $d>2$ is an integer. As before, we again study here counting problems that are inspired by the exciting advances on $2$-torsion point-counting in arithmetic statistics and on $2$-periodic point-counting in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any given prime $p\geq 3$ and any integer $\ell \geq 1$, the average number of distinct $2$-periodic integral points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is bounded (if $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\setminus \{1,p\}$) or zero or unbounded (if $\ell \in \{1,p\}$) as $c$ tends to infinity. Motivated further by $K$-rational periodic point-counting work of Benedetto, along with a conjecture of Hutz on $2$-periodic rational points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ for any given prime $p\geq 5$ and any integer $\ell \geq 1$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove that the average number of distinct $2$-periodic integral points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$ as $c$ tends to infinity. Finally, we then also apply here density and number field-counting results from arithmetic statistics, and as a result obtain again counting and statistical results on the irreducible monic integer polynomials and algebraic number fields arising naturally in our dynamical setting.</p></details>

> **Comment:** in Chinese and in English languages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classification of unitary representations for the non-compact real form E6(-14) of the exceptional Lie group E6 has long been hindered by computational bottlenecks due to its complex root system (72 roots) and large Weyl group (order 51840). This paper proposes a dimensional reduction method integrating root subsystem embedding, $\theta$-weight projection, and Langlands parameterization: by embedding the non-compact root subsystem of E6(-14) into the C2 root system of Sp(4), combined with weight space quotient (eliminating compact root redundancy), the problem is reduced from 6 dimensions to 2; the rationality of $\theta$-projection is verified from both algebraic and analytic perspectives, including analytic realization on representation spaces, redundancy of compact weight sublattices, and compatibility with analytic continuation of Langlands parameters; based on Langlands parameter restriction, the injectivity of representation correspondence and type preservation for discrete series, principal series, and complementary series are proven. This framework provides an algorithmic classification tool for E6(-14) unitary representations, which can be generalized to higher-rank exceptional groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a set $A$ and an abelian group $B$ with operators in $A$, in the sense of Krull and Noether, we introduce the Ore group extension $B[x; \sigma_B, \delta_B]$ as the additive group $B[x]$, with $A[x]$ as a set of operators. Here, the action of $A[x]$ on $B[x]$ is defined by mimicking the multiplication used in the classical case where $A$ and $B$ are the same ring. We derive generalizations of Vandermonde's and Leibniz's identities for this construction, and they are then used to establish associativity criteria. Additionally, we prove a version of Hilbert's basis theorem for this structure, under the assumption that the action of $A$ on $B$ is what we call weakly $s$-unital. Finally, we apply these results to the case where $B$ is a left module over a ring $A$, and specifically to the case where $A$ and $B$ coincide with a non-associative ring which is left distributive but not necessarily right distributive.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\lfloor x\rfloor$ denote the integer part of $x$. For every sequence $(C_k)_{k\ge 1}$ of positive integers, we define $\xi(C_k)$ as the smallest real number $\xi$ such that $\lfloor \xi^{C_k} \rfloor$ is a prime number for every positive integer $k$. The number $\xi(3^k)$ is called Mills' constant. Recently, the author showed that $\xi(3^k)$ is irrational, but the transcendency of this number is still open. In this paper, we give sufficient conditions on $(C_k)_{k\ge 1}$ to determine the transcendency of $\xi(C_k)$. For example, we obtain the following three results: (A) $\xi(\lfloor b^k\rfloor)$ is irrational for every real number $b\geq 1+\sqrt{2}$; (B) $\xi((1+\sqrt{2})^k+(1-\sqrt{2})^k)$ is transcendental; (C) $\xi(r3^k-1)$ is transcendental for every integer $r\geq 4.003\times 10^{14}$. Furthermore, assuming the Riemann hypothesis, $\xi(3^k-1)$ is transcendental. However, we still do not know whether Mills' constant is transcendental.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A classical argument was introduced by Khintchine in 1926 in order to exhibit the existence of totally irrational singular linear forms in two variables. This argument was subsequently revisited and extended by many authors. For instance, in 1959 Jarnik used it to show that for $n \geq 2$ and for any non-increasing positive $f$ there are totally irrational matrices $A \in M_{m,n}({\mathbb R})$ such that for all large enough $t$ there are $\mathbf{p} \in {\mathbb Z}^m, \mathbf{q} \in {\mathbb Z}^n \smallsetminus \{0\}$ with $$\|\mathbf{q}\| \leq t \ \text{ and } \ \|A \mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p}\| \leq f(t).$$ We denote the collection of such matrices by $\mathrm{UA}^*_{m,n}(f)$. We adapt Khintchine's argument to show that the sets $\mathrm{UA}^*_{m,n}(f)$, and their weighted analogues $\mathrm{UA}^*_{m,n}(f, \mathbf{w})$, intersect many manifolds and fractals, and have strong intersection properties. For example, we show that: When $n \geq 2$, the set $\bigcap_{\mathbf{w}} \mathrm{UA}^*(f, \mathbf{w}) $, where the intersection is over all weights $\mathbf{w}$, is nonempty, and moreover intesects many manifolds and fractals; For $n \geq 2$, there are vectors in ${\mathbb R}^n$ which are simultaneously $k$-singular for every $k$, in the sense of Yu; when $n \geq 3$, $\mathrm{UA}^*_{1,n}(f) + \mathrm{UA}^*_{1,n}(f) = {\mathbb R}^n$. We also obtain new bounds on the rate of singularity which can be attained by column vectors in analytic submanifolds of dimension at least 2 in ${\mathbb R}^n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a number field. Let $\pi_1,\pi_2$ be cuspidal automorphic representations of $GL_2(\mathbb{A}_F)$, and let $\pi$ be a cuspidal automorphic representation of either $GL_2(\mathbb{A}_F)$ or $GL_3(\mathbb{A}_F)$. When $(\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi)$ is of general type, we show that the triple product $L$-function $L(s,\pi_1 \times \pi_2 \times \pi)$ on either $GL(2) \times GL(2) \times GL(2)$ or $GL(2) \times GL(2) \times GL(3)$ has a standard zero-free region with no exceptional Landau-Siegel zero. Moreover, when $(\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi)$ is not of general type, we give precise conditions when $L(s,\pi_1 \times \pi_2 \times \pi)$ could possibly have exceptional Landau-Siegel zeros.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the modular resolution method using a new tool called a polyserie, introduced by Wildberger N.J. \& Rubine D. in their recent article \cite{wildberger2025hyper}. In the present article we try to prove an equivalence theorem of the existence and the uniqueness of the solution of the equation of the form:\\ $H_{t}^{2}\left(x\right) -H_{t}\left( x\right) +t\equiv 0\ \ \left( \mathrm{mod}\text{ }t^{n}\right) $, by using the same recurrence formula introduced in \cite{wildberger2025hyper} between the Catalan sequence terms: $C_{n+1}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}C_{k}C_{n-k}$. We introduce Wildberger's polynumber sequences, binomial Chu-Vandermonde identity, truncated polyseries and finally modular resolution as application.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Inspired by the work of Ellenberg, Elsholtz, Hall, and Kowalski, we investigate how the property of the generic fiber of a one-parameter family of abelian varieties being geometrically simple extends to other fibers. In \cite{EEHK09}, the authors studied a special case involving specific one-parameter families of Jacobians of curves using analytic methods. We generalize their results, particularly Theorem B, to all families of abelian varieties with big geometric monodromy, employing an arithmetic approach. Our method applies Heath-Brown-type bounds on certain covers with level structures and optimizes the covers to derive the desired results.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Final version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a family of products of elliptic curves over a rational curve defined over a number field $K$, and assuming that there exists no isogeny between the pair of elliptic curves in the generic fiber, we establish an upper bound for the number of special fibers with height at most $B$ where the two factors are isogenous. Our proof provides an upper bound that is dependent on $K$, the family, and the bound of height $B$. Furthermore, by introducing a slight modification to the definition of the height of the parametrizing family, we prove a uniform bound depends solely on the degree of the family, the field $K$, and $B$. Based on the uniformity, and the fact that the idea of using Heath-Brown type bounds on covers and optimizing the cover to count rational points on specific algebraic families has not been exploited much yet, we hope that the paper serves as a good example to illustrate the strengths of the method and will inspire further exploration and application of these techniques in related research.</p></details>
