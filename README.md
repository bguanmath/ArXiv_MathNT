> **Comment:** 13 pages; accepted version. Exposition expanded and details added in the reductive case

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $G$ a connected linear algebraic group over a $p$-adic field, we show that the action of $G(\mathbb{B}^+_{\mathrm{dR}})$ on each Schubert cell in the $\mathbb{B}_{\mathrm{dR}}^+$-affine Grassmannian is transitive in the étale topology on affinoid perfectoids, generalizing a result in the reductive case due to Fargues and Scholze.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jesse Jääsaari &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We obtain $Ω$-results for linear exponential sums with rational additive twists of small prime denominators weighted by Hecke eigenvalues of Maass cusp forms for the group $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb Z)$. In particular, our $Ω$-results match the expected conjectural upper bounds when the denominator of the twist is sufficiently small compared to the length of the sum. Non-trivial $Ω$-results for sums over short segments are also obtained. Along the way we produce lower bounds for mean squares of the exponential sums in question and also improve the best known upper bound for these sums in some ranges of parameters.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Reclassify Erdos-935 as Independent Rediscovery, bringing the number of autonomous solutions down to 5. (Explanation in Addendum 4.1) Elaborate on Footnote 3. Slightly reword various phrases in the Introduction in response to feedback

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a case study in semi-autonomous mathematics discovery, using Gemini to systematically evaluate 700 conjectures labeled 'Open' in Bloom's Erdős Problems database. We employ a hybrid methodology: AI-driven natural language verification to narrow the search space, followed by human expert evaluation to gauge correctness and novelty. We address 13 problems that were marked 'Open' in the database: 5 through seemingly novel autonomous solutions, and 8 through identification of previous solutions in the existing literature. Our findings suggest that the 'Open' status of the problems was through obscurity rather than difficulty. We also identify and discuss issues arising in applying AI to math conjectures at scale, highlighting the difficulty of literature identification and the risk of ''subconscious plagiarism'' by AI. We reflect on the takeaways from AI-assisted efforts on the Erdős Problems.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Changchang Xi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 24 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Quasi-hereditary algebras were introduced by Cline, Parshall and Scott to describe the highest weight categories of representations of semisimple Lie algebras and algebraic groups by the module categories of finite-dimensional algebras. Since then a lot of homological, structural and categorical properties of quasi-hereditary algebras have been discovered. This class of algebras seems quite common and occurs in many branches of mathematics. There are lots of important works on the subject. In this note we mainly survey some of Claus Michael Ringel's works or works jointly with his collaborators on quasi-hereditary algebras. Also, some of related works and recent developments on quasi-hereditary algebras are mentioned.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages, 3 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We generalize Voronoi's theory of perfect quadratic forms to generalized copositive matrices over a closed convex and full-dimensional cone K. We introduce a notion of a K-copositive minimum and of perfect K-copositive matrices. We consider a key feature of a given cone, which we call Interior Ryshkov (IR) property. Under this property the classical theory and its applications generalize nicely and we prove that rationally generated cones possess this IR property. For contrast, we give a detailed example of a simple cone without the IR property, showing various differences to the classical case. Moreover, this example yields connections to questions of number theory, in particular to Diophantine approximation and the Pell Equation. Finally, as an application, we give inner and outer polyhedral approximations for the generalized completely positive cone and a method to find rational certificates for (non-)membership in this cone.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a field, $L$ a finite Galois extension of $K$, and $X$ an abelian variety defined over $L$. If $X$ is isogenous over $L$ to an abelian variety defined over $K$, then the $\ell$-adic Galois representations associated to $X$ extend to representations $\barρ_{\ell,X}:\mathrm{Gal}(\bar{L}/K)\to\mathrm{Aut}(V_\ell X)$ for every prime $\ell$. This paper aims to show that the converse is true for abelian varieties of Type I, with some supplementary conditions needed on the endomorphisms of $X$, when $L$ is either a number field or a function field of prime characteristic different from $2$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 9 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We discuss algorithms for arithmetic properties of hypergeometric functions. Most notably, we are able to compute the p-adic valuation of a hypergeometric function on any disk of radius smaller than the p-adic radius of convergence. This we use, building on work of Christol, to determine the set of prime numbers modulo which it can be reduced. Moreover, we describe an algorithm to find an annihilating polynomial of the reduction of a hypergeometric function modulo p.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a function field analogue of Mertens' formula for Euler products restricted to primes in arithmetic progressions over the polynomial ring F_q[t]. Our results are in direct correspondence with those of Languasco and Zaccagnini for arithmetic progressions in the integers. Over function fields, Weil's Riemann hypothesis for Dirichlet L-functions holds unconditionally, and consequently the analogue of the GRH-strength asymptotic is obtained without any exceptional zero correction term.</p></details>

> **Comment:** expository note, 9 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Montgomery in 1973 introduced the pair correlation method to study the vertical distribution of Riemann zeta-function zeros. This work assumed the Riemann Hypothesis (RH). One striking application was a short proof that at least 2/3 of zeta-zeros are simple zeros, the first result of its type. Over the last 50 years, most work on pair correlation of zeta-zeros has continued to assume RH. Here we show that if RH could be removed from Montgomery's simple zero proof, then this would also give a proof that 2/3 of the zeros are simple and on the critical line. This idea has been applied in several recent papers to obtain other results on the zeros.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Somnath Maiti &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 28 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Brocard-Ramanujan problem pertaining to the diophantine equation $n!+1=m^2$, a famously unsolved problem, deals with finding the integer solutions to the equation. Nobody has discovered any new solution of the problem beyond $n=4,~5$ and $7$ although many of us have tried it. Bruce Berndt and William Galway \cite{Berndt} had not found any new solution in 2000 by extensive computer search for a solution with $n$ up to $10^9$. The purpose of this study is to show that the solutions should satisfy some necessary and/or sufficient conditions. If $\sqrt{n!}=k+ε,~n>1,~0<ε<1$; then it has solution if and only if $n!=k(k+2)$ and $ε,~k$ are strictly monotonic increasing. It has only finitely many solutions which is not based on any conjecture or previous research on the Brocard-Ramanujan problem. For the new solution of Brocard-Ramanujan problem ($n\ge 10^5$), the value of $ε$ should be more than $0.999 \cdots 905915$ (digit 0 is coming after 228287 numbers of 9 digit, which takes more than 66 pages in (LibreOffice Writer) indicating almost impossibility of new solution. If we consider $n\geq 10^9$, I am unable to calculate the said numbers of 9 digit in the value of $ε$ in my personal laptop (with 8GB Ram) using MATHEMATICA 8. Finally, it has been claimed to discover that the problem has no further solution.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05764v1'>2602.05764</a>\]&nbsp; **A Dieudonné theory for analytic p-divisible groups and applications to Shimura varieties**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Lucas Gerth &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 84 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study families of analytic $p$-divisible groups over adic spaces $S$ defined over $\mathbb{Q}_p$. We prove an equivalence between such families and Hodge-Tate triples, generalizing a theorem of Fargues. For a perfectoid space $S$, we construct a functor associating to an analytic $p$-divisible group $\mathcal{G} \rightarrow S$ a coherent sheaf $\mathcal{E}(\mathcal{G})$ on the relative Fargues--Fontaine curve $X_S$. Restricting to analytic $p$-divisible groups admitting a Cartier dual, we obtain an equivalence of categories with local shtukas satisfying a minuscule condition, compatible with the prismatic Dieudonné theory of Anschütz--Le Bras. We conclude with applications to moduli spaces: we show that the local Shimura varieties of EL and PEL types of Scholze--Weinstein are moduli spaces of analytic $p$-divisible groups with extra structure, and we give a reinterpretation of the Hodge--Tate period map of Scholze in terms of topologically $p$-torsion subgroups of abelian varieties.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Barbara Betti, Claudiu Raicu, Francesco Romeo, Jyoti Singh &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AC &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 16 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the diagonal F-thresholds of determinantal hypersurfaces arising from a generic matrix and from a generic symmetric matrix, as well as of the Pfaffian hypersurface arising from a generic skew-symmetric matrix of even size. The main ingredient is a cohomology vanishing theorem for certain line bundles on flag varieties in characteristic $p$. In the cases of the generic matrix and the generic skew-symmetric matrix, we show that the diagonal F-threshold attains its minimal possible value, namely the negative of the a-invariant. The symmetric case is more subtle and relies in addition on a polynomiality result for representations afforded by cohomology, building on work of the second author with VandeBogert.</p></details>

> **Comment:** some inaccuracies are revised

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We denote by $P^+(n)$ the largest prime factor of the integer $n$. In 1935, Erd\H os studied the quantity $T_c(x)$ defined by $$ T_c(x)=\big|\big\{p\le x: P^+(p-1)\ge p^c\big\}\big|, $$ and he proved $$ \limsup_{x\rightarrow \infty}\frac{T_c(x)}{π(x)}\rightarrow 0, \quad \text{as~}c\rightarrow 1. $$ Recently, Ding gave a quantitative form of Erd\H os' result, showing that $$ \limsup_{x\rightarrow \infty}\frac{T_c(x)}{π(x)}\le 8\big(c^{-1}-1\big). $$ holds for $8/9< c<1$. In this paper, we improve Ding's upper bound to $$ \limsup_{x\rightarrow \infty}\frac{T_c(x)}{π(x)}\le -\frac{7}{2}\log c $$ for $e^{-\frac{2}{7}}< c<1$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05731v1'>2602.05731</a>\]&nbsp; **An approach to the Lindelöf Hypothesis for Dirichlet $L$-functions**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yuri Matiyasevich &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Preprints of the St.Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics 07/2025

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The suggested approach is based on a known representation of Dirichlet $L$-functions via the incomplete gamma functions. Some properties of the Taylor coefficients of the lower incomplete gamma function at infinity seem to be new. Specifically, these coefficients can be expressed in terms of Touchard polynomials. Furthermore, these same coefficients can be used to reformulate the functional equation for Dirichlet $L$-functions. This relationship "explains"' why $\vert L_χ(1/2+i t)\vert $ should be small. To present the new ideas in a nutshell, we start by giving (in Section 1) a "formula proof" of the Lindelöf hypothesis. This is not a genuine proof, as we are not concerned with the convergence of our series nor do we justify changing the order of summation. In Section 2, we suggest some hypothetical ways of transforming the "proof" from Section 1 into a rigorous mathematical proof. Sections 3-5 contain some technical details and bibliographical references.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 29 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve. We say that $E$ has a near coincidence of level $(n,m)$ if $m \mid n$ and $\mathbb{Q}(E[n]) = \mathbb{Q}(E[m],ζ_{n})$. We classify near coincidences of prime power level and use this result to give a classification of values of $n$ for which ${\rm Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(E[n])/\mathbb{Q})$ is a nilpotent group. Along the way we prove a Gauss-Wantzel analog for the elliptic curve $E\colon y^2 = x^3-x$, showing that $\mathbb{Q}(E[n])/\mathbb{Q}$ is constructible if and only if $\varphi(n)$ is a power of 2. Assuming that there are no non-CM rational points on the modular curves $X_{ns}^{+}(p)$ for primes $p > 11$, we show that ${\rm Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(E[n])/\mathbb{Q})$ nilpotent implies that $n$ is a power of $2$ or $n \in \{ 3, 5, 6, 7, 15, 21 \}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X$ be a compact arithmetic hyperbolic surface, and let $ψ$ be an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass form on $X$ with sufficiently large spectral parameter $λ$. We give a new proof to obtain some power saving for the global $L^6$-norm $\|ψ\|_{L^6(X)}\lesssim_ελ^{\frac{1}{6}-\frac{1}{144}+ε}$ over the local bound $\|ψ\|_{L^6(X)}\lesssimλ^{\frac16}$ of Sogge. Using the $L^\infty$-norm bound $\|ψ\|_{L^\infty(X)}\lesssim_ελ^{\frac{5}{12}+ε}$ of Iwaniec and Sarnak and harmonic analysis tools, we reduce the $L^6$-norm problem to a microlocal $L^6$ Kakeya-Nikodym estimate for $ψ$. Finally, we establish an improved microlocal $L^6$ Kakeya-Nikodym estimate via arithmetic amplification developed by Iwaniec and Sarnak.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A set $\mathcal S\subset \mathbb N$ is said to be a subset-sum-distinct or dissociated if all of its finite subsets have different sums. Alternately, an equivalent classification is if any equality of the form $$\sum_{s\in \mathcal S} \varepsilon_s \cdot s =0$$ where $\varepsilon_s \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ implies that all the $\varepsilon_s$'s are $0$. For a dissociated set $\mathcal S$, we prove that for $c_\ast = \frac 12 \log_2 \left(\frac π2\right)$ and any $c_\ast-1<C<c_\ast$, we have $$\mathcal S(n) \,:=\, \mathcal S\cap [1,n] \,\le\, \log_2 n +\frac 12 \log_2\log_2 n + C$$ for all $n\in \mathcal N_C$ with asymptotic density $\mathbf d\left(\mathcal N_C\right)=2-2^{c_\ast-C}$. Further, we consider the greedy algorithm for generating these sets and prove that this algorithm always eventually doubles. Finally, we also consider some generalizations of dissociated sets and prove similar results about them.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a finite set $S$ of distinct primes, we propose a method to construct polylogarithmic motivic Chabauty-Kim functions for $\mathbb{P}^1 \setminus \{ 0,1,\infty \}$ using resultants. For a prime $p\not\in S$, the vanishing loci of the images of such functions under the $p$-adic period map contain the solutions of the $S$-unit equation. In the case $\vert S\vert=2$, we explicitly construct a non-trivial motivic Chabauty-Kim function in depth 6 of degree 18, and prove that there do not exist any other Chabauty-Kim functions with smaller depth and degree. The method, inspired by work of Dan-Cohen and the first author, enhances the geometric step algorithm developed by Corwin and Dan-Cohen, providing a more efficient approach.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a new decomposition formula for two orthogonal projections P and Q on a separable Hilbert space V. This formula yields an orthogonal direct sum decomposition of V into invariant subspaces under P and Q, each of which is either at most two dimensional or infinite dimensional. On every infinite dimensional component, the pair (P,Q) admits a matrix representation that we call the "one-shifted form". This representation diagonalizes both P and Q into blocks of size at most two, and moreover, both projections can be explicitly approximated by orthogonal projections on finite dimensional subspaces. This approximation scheme offers a way to derive infinite dimensional results from their finite dimensional counterparts and is also useful in numerical computations. This decomposition provides a useful framework for analyzing a wide range of problems involving two orthogonal projections in infinite dimensions. In particular, several spectral problems for operators generated by P and Q (including polynomials in P and Q) can be reduced to the case where the pair admits a one-shifted form. More concretely, we can estimate the spectral radius of [P,Q], which is equivalent to estimating the spectral radius of the Bell-CHSH operator, a quantity of fundamental importance in quantum mechanics. We provide an upper bound and a lower bound for the spectral radius of [P,Q], which become exact when the matrix representations of P and Q are in "constant-angle one-shifted form".</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We address an inverse problem in non-Archimedean dynamics: given a finite discrete dynamical system (equivalently, a functional graph on $N$ states), construct a continuous $p$-adic dynamical system whose residue-level behavior reproduces the prescribed transitions. Using the cylinder partition of $\mathcal{O}_K$ (viewed as \emph{Witt cylinders} for unramified $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$), we encode states by pairwise disjoint closed balls and formalize an \textbf{interpreter} as a map sending each state ball into its target ball. Our main existence result constructs rational interpreters that are analytic (hence pole-free) on the prescribed state cylinders, combining rigid-analytic Runge approximation with finite interpolation constraints. Under a linear-dominance condition on each cylinder, ball images are explicit and locally affine, leading to a robust classification of discrete behavior into contractive, indifferent, and expansive regimes. Good reduction provides a selection principle for natural interpreters; effective degree and height bounds for general rational interpreters remain open. For composite alphabets we prove a \textbf{Dynamic Chinese Remainder Theorem} for congruence-preserving systems: the CRT isomorphism $Θ:\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}\xrightarrow{\sim}\prod_i\mathbb{Z}/p_i^{k_i}\mathbb{Z}$ (for $m=\prod p_i^{k_i}$) yields a factorization of the \emph{dynamics} (equivalently, the functional graph) on $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ into dynamics on the prime-power components, compatible with reduction. Finally, we discuss an inverse-limit (profinite) extension: compatible towers define a $1$-Lipschitz map on $\mathbb{Z}_p$, while selecting compatible analytic/rational interpreters across levels becomes a separate problem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop and numerically analyze an algebraic-geometric framework for spin-adapted coupled-cluster (CC) theory. Since the electronic Hamiltonian is SU(2)-invariant, physically relevant quantum states lie in the spin singlet sector. We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the quantum virtual Grothendieck ring, denoted by $\frakK_q(\g)$, which was introduced in [39], and further investigated in [26, 25]. Our approach involves examining this ring from two perspectives: first, by considering its connection to quantum cluster algebras of non-skew-symmetric types; and second, by exploring its relevance to categorification theory. We specifically focus on (i) the homomorphisms that arise from braid moves, particularly 4-moves and 6-moves, in the braid group; and (ii) the quantum Laurent positivity phenomena, which has not yet been proven for non-skew-symmetric types. As applications of our results, we derive the substitution formulas for non-skew-symmetric types discussed in [11] for skew-symmetric types, and demonstrate that any truncated element in a heart subring, denoted by $\frakK_{q,Q}(\g)$, which corresponds to a simple module over the quiver Hecke algebra $R^\g$, possesses coefficients in $\Z_{\ge 0}[q^{\pm 1/2}]$. This result is particularly interesting because it implies that each truncated Kirillov--Reshetikhin polynomial in $\frakK_{q,Q}(\g)$ and each element in the standard basis $\sfE_q(\g)$ of the entire ring $\frakK_q(\g)$ have coefficients also in $\Z_{\ge 0}[q^{\pm 1/2}]$. Since (truncated) Kirillov--Reshetikhin polynomials can be obtained using a quantum cluster algebra algorithm and appear as quantum cluster variables, they provide compelling evidence in support of the quantum Laurent positivity conjecture in non-skew-symmetric types.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study "dead ends" in square-free digit walks: square-free integers $N$ such that, in base $b$, every one-digit extension $bN+d$ is non-square-free. In base $10$, the stochastic independence model of Miller et al. suggests that infinite square-free walks occur with probability near $1$, corresponding to an asymptotic dead-end density of $\approx 5.218\times 10^{-5}$. We prove that the true asymptotic dead-end density satisfies $$ c_{\mathrm{dead}} \approx 1.317\times 10^{-9}, $$ roughly a factor of $\sim 4\times 10^4$ smaller than the prediction. For every base $b\geq 2$, we prove that dead-end densities exist and are given by a closed-form expression (as a finite alternating sum of Euler products). The argument is fully formalized in Lean/Mathlib, and was produced automatically by AxiomProver from a natural-language statement of the problem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For odd primes $p$, we let $K_p:=\mathbb{Q}(ζ_p)$ be the $p$th cyclotomic field and let $ω$ denote its Teichmuller character. For $α>1/2$, we say that an odd prime $p$ is partially regular if the eigenspaces of the $p$-Sylow subgroup of $\mathrm{Cl}(K_p)$ under the Galois action vanish for all characters $ω^{p-2k}$ with $$ 2\le 2k \le \frac{\sqrt{p}}{(\log p)^α}. $$ Equivalently, $p\nmid \mathrm{num}(B_{2k})$ throughout this range. We prove that a density-one subset of primes is partially regular in this sense. By Leopoldt reflection, this yields a partial Vandiver Theorem: for a density-one set of primes $p$, the even eigenspaces $A_p(ω^{2k})$ vanish for all even $2k$ satisfying the inequality above. This result has consequences for Kubota-Leopoldt $p$-adic $L$-functions, congruences between cusp forms and Eisenstein series, and $p$-torsion in algebraic $K$-groups. The theorem proving partial regularity for almost all $p$ is fully formalized in Lean/Mathlib and was produced automatically by AxiomProver from a natural-language statement of the conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Enrico Bombieri showed conditionally (1994) that the ABC conjecture implies Roth's theorem, and Van Frankenhuysen (1999) later provided a complete proof. Building on Bombieri's and Van der Poorten's explicit formula for continued-fraction coefficients of algebraic numbers (specialized to cubic roots) we derive an effective bound for a Roth-type constant assuming an effective form of ABC. Roth's original argument establishes existence but does not yield an explicit value; our approach makes the dependence on the ABC parameters explicit and also gives an explicit bound in the corresponding special case of Ridout's theorem. We then introduce the notion of approximation gain as a refinement of the quality of an abc-triple. For c in a large computational range, the approximation gain remains below a strikingly small threshold, motivating the conjecture that the approximation gain is always smaller than 1.5. This suggests a potential strategy for attacking ABC by bounding approximation gain and power gain separately.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 36 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical Erdős-Kac theorem states that for $n$ chosen uniformly at random from $1, \dots, N$, the random variable $(ω(n) - \log\log N)/\sqrt{\log\log N}$ converges in distribution to the standard Gaussian as $N$ tends to infinity. Banks and Shparlinski showed that this Gaussian convergence holds for any Beatty sequence $\lfloorαn + β\rfloor$ in place of $n$. Continuing in this spirit, Crnčević, Hernández, Rizk, Sereesuchart and Tao considered the joint distribution of $ω(n)$ and $ω(\lfloorαn\rfloor)$, which they showed to be asymptotically independent for irrational values of $α$. Generalising both results, we show that for any positive integer $k$, real numbers $α_1, \dots, α_k > 0$ and $β_1, \dots, β_k$, where $α_i/α_j$ is irrational for $i\neq j$, the joint distribution of $(ω(\lfloorα_in + β_i\rfloor) - \log\log N)/\sqrt{\log\log N}$ converges to the $k$-dimensional standard Gaussian. We next discuss quantitative bounds on the rate of convergence which do not depend on the values taken by the relevant parameters. Banks and Shparlinski remarked that such quantitative bounds may be given for a single Beatty sequence $\lfloorαn + β\rfloor$ under Diophantine type assumptions on $α$. We show that such assumptions are in fact unnecessary. Specifically, for any real numbers $α> 0, β$, we show that the Kolmogorov distance between the random variable $(ω(\lfloorαn + β\rfloor) - \log\log N)/\sqrt{\log\log N}$ and the standard Gaussian is bounded above by $O(\log\log\log N/\sqrt{\log\log N})$ as $N$ tends to infinity. On the other hand, we show that universal quantitative bounds of this kind do not exist for higher-degree generalised polynomials or for the joint convergence for multiple Beatty sequences.</p></details>

P.Erdős established an upper bound $O(x^{σ+ε})$ for the growth function $|\langle F : s \rangle\cap[0,x]|$, where $1/a_1^σ+1/a_2^σ+\ldots + 1/a_n^σ=1$ and $\varepsilon>0$, which was extended to orbit multisets and real affine functions by J.Lagarias. We complement this by a lower bound $Ω(x^σ)$ for the multiset size $|\langle F : s \rangle^\#\cap[0,x]|$. P.Erdős and R.Graham asked whether an orbit set $\langle F : s \rangle$ has positive density when $F$ is a basis of a free semigroup and $1/a_1+1/a_2+\ldots + 1/a_n=1$. Under these two conditions, we establish a sublinear lower bound $|\langle F : s \rangle \cap [0,x]|=Ω(x/\log^{\frac{n-1}2} x)$. We also show that in the case when the functions of $F$ form an exact covering system of integers, i.e. when $f_1(\mathbb Z) \sqcup \ldots \sqcup f_n(\mathbb Z)=\mathbb Z$, this bound can be strengthened to $Ω(x)$, so the set $\langle F : s \rangle$ has positive density.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be an algebraic group over a field $k$, and $M$ and $N$ be $G$-modules. In 1961, Hochschild showed how one can define the cohomology groups $\text{Ext}_{G}^{i}(M,N)$. Kimura, in 1965, showed that one can generalize this to get relative cohomology for algebraic groups. The original cohomology groups play an important role in understanding the representation theory of $G$, but the role of relative cohomology is still not well understood. In this paper the author expands upon the work of Kimura to prove foundational results about the relative cohomology. The author starts by giving the definitions of relative exact sequences and relative injective modules and proves a variety of basic properties for each that will be essential to define relative cohomology and obtain a relative Grothendieck spectral sequence. In particular, the induction functor will play an important role when studying the relative injective modules. Once the necessary ground work is laid, the definition of relative cohomology is given. Finally, it is stated when there is a relative Grothendieck spectral sequence, and many consequences and examples are provided.</p></details>

We provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which \( h_q(n) = 0 \) holds. As an application, we show that \( h_q(\ell^t) = 0 \) whenever \( q \) is a primitive root modulo \( \ell^t \). Moreover, we prove that if \( n \) is odd and \( h_q(n) = 0 \), then also \( h_q(2n) = 0 \). As an example, we show that \( h_3(11) =h_3(16) = 1 \). Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between the coverings of \(\mathbb{F}_{q^m}^n\) and \(\mathbb{F}_q^{mn}\), and obtain several sufficient conditions for \(h_{q^m}(n) = 0\). Specifically, we derive that if \(n = 3\) or \(n = 2^d\) (where \(d\) is a nonnegative integer), then \(h_4(n) = 0\).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study proper isometric actions of non-compact semisimple Lie groups on symmetric spaces in pseudo-Riemannian geometry. Motivated by Okuda's classification of semisimple symmetric spaces admitting proper $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$-actions [J. Differ. Geom., 2013], we focus on a family of symmetric spaces lying on the "boundary case" of the existence of proper $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$-actions. As a rigidity result, we show that any connected non-compact semisimple Lie group acting properly on this family must be globally isomorphic to $Spin(n,1)$ up to compact factors. Moreover, the largest value of $n$ for the existence of $Spin(n,1)$-proper actions is governed by the Hurwitz-Radon number. Our family includes the pseudo-Riemannian hyperbolic space $\mathbf{H}_{+}^{N,N-1}$ of signature $(N,N-1)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K = \mathbb{Q}(i)$. We study the Petersson inner product of a Hermitian Eisenstein series of Siegel type on the unitary group $U_{5}(K)$, diagonally-restricted on $U_2(K)\times U_2(K)\times U_1(K)$, against two Hermitian cuspidal eigenforms $F, G$ of degree $2$ and an elliptic cuspidal eigenform $h$ (seen as a Hermitian modular form of degree 1), all having weight $k \equiv 0 \pmod 4$. We obtain, through this consideration, an integral representation of a certain Dirichlet series, together with an additional residue term. By taking $F$ to belong in the Maass space, we are able to show that the Dirichlet series possesses an Euler product. Moreover, its $p$-factor for an inert prime $p$ can be essentially identified with the twist by $h$ of a degree six Euler factor attached to $G$ by Gritsenko. The question of whether the same holds for the primes that split remains unanswered here, even though we make considerable steps in that direction too. Our paper is inspired by a work of Heim, who considered a similar question in the case of Siegel modular forms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For semisimple Lie algebras, the BGG resolution is often viewed as a categorification of the Weyl character formula. For general linear Lie superalgebras, Brundan--Stroppel constructed an infinite resolution of the so-called Kostant simple modules by Kac modules, but their construction does not directly generalize the classical BGG resolution. In this paper we construct, for weights lying outside a neighborhood of the walls of the Weyl chambers, a resolution that categorifies a known Weyl-type finite-sum character formula in the same spirit as the Kac--Wakimoto formula. Our resolution is built from images of canonical homomorphisms between Verma modules attached to non-conjugate Borel subalgebras related by odd reflections. In particular, the construction developed here does generalize the classical BGG resolution.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Twisted $L$-functions by Dirichlet characters offer deep insights into arithmetic geometry, especially in the study of elliptic curves and abelian varieties over number fields. In the function field setting, Drinfeld modules and Anderson modules serve as analogues of elliptic curves and abelian varieties, and Goss $L$-series play the role of Hasse-Weil $L$-functions. This paper introduces a motivic framework for studying twisted Goss $L$-series via Anderson motives associated to Drinfeld modules and Artin representations. For a Drinfeld module and an Artin representation on the absolute Galois group, we present a construction of Anderson motives associated to them and we show that it comes from a uniformizable abelian Anderson module. We also study their associated $L$-series, which recover the norm of the twisted Goss $L$-values. These results provide an interpretation of twisted Goss $L$-values in terms of regulators of Anderson modules with the help of Taelman's class number formula.</p></details>

In particular, we construct explicit counterexamples, all of which are rational. As another application, we construct sequences of non-free rational numbers converging to $3$. These sequences are given by $$ 3 + \frac{3}{2 (9 n - 1)} \quad \text{and} \quad 3 + \frac{9 n + 5}{3 (2 n + 1) (9 n + 4)},$$ and their construction relies on the orbit test together with a modified Pell's equation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this note, we study the distribution of the rational canonical form of a random matrix over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$, whose entries are independent and $ε$-balanced with $ε\in(0,1-1/p]$. We show that, as the matrix size tends to infinity, the statistics converge to independent Cohen-Lenstra distributions, demonstrating the universality of this asymptotic behavior. In particular, we recover, as a special case, the uniform setting proved by Fulman in his thesis in 1997. Our proof uses the fact that the rational canonical form data of $A_n$ and the $\mathbb{F}_p[t]$-module structure of the function field cokernel $\Cok(tI_n-A_n)$ determine each other uniquely. Consequently, our question can be reformulated, equivalently, as the asymptotic distribution problem for this cokernel, which has been established by Cheong-Yu (arXiv:2303.09125).</p></details>

Instead of encoding data through representable integers, the proposed protocol embeds information into the gap structure of carefully chosen symmetric numerical semigroups. Symmetry guarantees a balanced gap density, ensuring that encoded values are statistically indistinguishable from uniform numerical noise to an observer lacking the private generating set. The security of the scheme relies on the assumed average-case hardness of numerical semigroup membership inference for hidden generators, offering a novel number-theoretic primitive for covert communication and post-quantum resilient information hiding.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper, commissioned as a survey of the Riemann Hypothesis, provides a comprehensive overview of 165 years of mathematical approaches to this fundamental problem, while introducing a new perspective that emerged during its preparation. The paper begins with a detailed description of what we know about the Riemann zeta function and its zeros, followed by an extensive survey of mathematical theories developed in pursuit of RH -- from classical analytic approaches to modern geometric and physical methods. We also discuss several equivalent formulations of the hypothesis. Within this survey framework, we present an original contribution in the form of a "Letter to Riemann," using only mathematics available in his time. This letter reveals a method inspired by Riemann's own approach to the conformal mapping theorem: by extremizing a quadratic form (restriction of Weil's quadratic form in modern language), we obtain remarkable approximations to the zeros of zeta. Using only primes less than 13, this optimization procedure yields approximations to the first 50 zeros with accuracies ranging from $2.6 \times 10^{-55}$ to $10^{-3}$. Moreover we prove a general result that these approximating values lie exactly on the critical line. Following the letter, we explain the underlying mathematics in modern terms, including the description of a deep connection of the Weil quadratic form with the world of information theory. The final sections develop a geometric perspective using trace formulas, outlining a potential proof strategy based on establishing convergence of zeros from finite to infinite Euler products. While completing the commissioned survey, these new results suggest a promising direction for future research on Riemann's conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>One of the starting points of this work was the duality of Borcea relating standard level $k$ representations of $A_1^{(1)}$ and level $2k+1$ of $A_2^{(2)}$. For $k=1$ the combinatorial bases in both cases yield the two Capparelli identities and we wanted to see if there is a correspondence between the bases in terms of partitions for all $k\in\mathbb N$. By using the vertex operator relations in the principal picture for level $5$ standard $A_2^{(2)}$-modules we reduce a spanning set of Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt-type vectors in $L(5Λ_0)$ by removing the leading terms of relations and rendering a list of 34 ``difference'' conditions for partitions.We have with computer programs sorted out the sets of partitions satisfying these conditions and formed the partial generating series which agrees with the principally specialized character for all powers of $q$ up to $41$. Although our list of leading terms is incomplete, our results show that the corresponding combinatorial identity for $L_{A_2^{(2)}}(5Λ_0)$ drastically differs from the one for the Borcea dual $L_{A_1^{(1)}}(2Λ_0)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $S=\langle d_1,\dots,d_m\rangle$ be a numerical semigroup and $k[S]$ its semigroup ring. The Hilbert numerator of $k[S]$ determines normalized alternating syzygy power sums $K_p(S)$ encoding alternating power sums of syzygy degrees. Fel conjectured an explicit formula for $K_p(S)$, for all $p\ge 0$, in terms of the gap power sums $G_r(S)=\sum_{g\notin S} g^r$ and universal symmetric polynomials $T_n$ evaluated at the generator power sums $σ_k=\sum_i d_i^k$ (and $δ_k=(σ_k-1)/2^k$). We prove Fel's conjecture via exponential generating functions and coefficient extraction, solating the universal identities for $T_n$ needed for the derivation. The argument is fully formalized in Lean/Mathlib, and was produced automatically by AxiomProver from a natural-language statement of the conjecture.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 48 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Initiated in work by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten, the area known as $τ$-tilting theory plays a fundamental role in contemporary representation theory. In this paper we explore a higher-dimensional analogue of this theory, formulated with respect to the higher Auslander-Reiten translation $τ_d$. In particular, we associate to any functorially finite $d$-torsion class a maximal $τ_d$-rigid pair and a $(d+1)$-term silting complex. In the case $d=1$, the notions of maximal $τ_d$-rigid and support $τ$-tilting pairs coincide, and our theory recovers the classical bijections. However, the proof strategies for $d>1$ differ significantly. As an intermediate step, we prove that a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of a module category induces a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of the category of $(d+1)$-term complexes, producing novel examples of $d$-exact categories. We introduce the notion of a $d$-torsion class in the exact setup, and use this to obtain the aforementioned $(d+1)$-term silting complex. We moreover apply our theory to study $d$-APR tilting modules and slices. To illustrate our results, we provide explicit combinatorial descriptions of maximal $τ_d$-rigid pairs and $(d+1)$-term silting complexes for higher Auslander and higher Nakayama algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a real $m\times n$ matrix $\pmbξ$, we consider its sequence of best Diophantine approximation vectors $ \pmb{x}_i \in \mathbb{Z}^n, \, i =1,2,3, ... $, the sequences of its norms $X_i = \|\pmb{x}_i\|$ and the norms of remainders $L_i = \|\pmbξ\pmb{x}_i\|$. It is known that, in the cases $m=1$, bad approximability of $\pmbξ$ is equivalent to the boundedness of ratios $\frac{X_{i+1}}{X_i}$, while for $n=1$ bad approximability of $\pmbξ$ is equivalent to the boundedness of ratios $ \frac{L_i}{L_{i+1}}$. Moreover, carefully constructed example show that in the cases $m=1$ and $n=1$ boundedness of ratios $ \frac{L_i}{L_{i+1}}$ and $\frac{X_{i+1}}{X_i}$ respectively (the order of ratios changed), does not imply bad approximability of $\pmbξ$. In the present paper, we study the impact of the boundedness of ratios on Diophantine properties of $\pmbξ$, in particular, what restrictions it gives for Diophantine exponents $ω(\pmbξ)$ and $\hatω(\pmbξ)$. One of our particular results deals with the case $m=n=2$. We prove that for $2\times 2 $ matrices $\pmbξ$ boundedness of both ratios $ \frac{X_{i+1}}{X_i}, \frac{L_i}{L_{i+1}} $ implies inequality $\hatω(\pmbξ)\le \frac{4}{3}$ and that this result is optimal. Our methods combine parametric geometry of numbers as well as more classical tools.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This work investigates the invariance of the non-necessarily finite uniform dimension and related concepts for subextensions in skew polynomial rings \mbox{$ \mathbb{S}=R[ \mathbf{\mathrm{X}}; \mathbfα , \mathbfδ ]$} of bijective type over a well-ordered set of variables. When the coefficient ring has enough uniform left ideals, in the commuting variables case we show that classical results on this topic for polynomial rings extend to subextensions of skew Laurent polynomial rings \mbox{$ \mathbb{S}=R[ \mathbf{\mathrm{X}}^{\pm1}; \mathbfα]$}, generated over $R$ by any family of (standard) terms. The situation in the non-commuting variables context is more complex; easily formed polynomial-like subrings can behave very oddly from the ambient ring. We provide easy examples of a (semi)prime left Goldie skew polynomial ring of bijective type containing a monoid subring isomorphic to a free non-commutative polynomial ring. We then study the so-called subclass of \emph{essentially special subextensions} and obtain for them the preservation of the uniform dimension and related concepts.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages; minor changes; accepted by Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Originally motivated by connections to integrable systems, two natural subalgebras of the rational Cherednik algebra have been considered in the literature. The first is the subalgebra of all degree zero elements and the second is the Dunkl angular momentum subalgebra. In this article, we study the ring-theoretic and homological properties of these algebras. Our approach is to realise them as rings of invariants under the action of certain reductive subgroups of $\rm SL_2$. This allows us to describe their centres. Moreover, we show that they are Auslander-Gorenstein and Cohen-Macaulay and, at $t = 0$, give rise to prime PI-algebras whose PI-degree we compute. Since the degree zero subalgebra can be realized as the ring of invariants for the maximal torus $\rm T \subset SL_2$ and the action of this torus on the rational Cherednik algebra is Hamiltonian, we also consider its (quantum) Hamiltonian reduction with respect to $\rm T$. At $t = 1$, the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the spherical subalgebra is a filtered quantization of the quotient of the minimal nilpotent orbit closure $\overline{\mathcal O}_{\min}$ in ${\mathfrak gl}(n)$ by the reflection group $W$. At $t = 0$, we get a graded Poisson deformation of the symplectic singularity $\overline{\mathcal O}_{\min}/W$.</p></details>

Using contour integration, these integrals are first converted to some hyperbolic (infinite) sums of Ramanujan type, all of which can be calculated in closed form by comparing both the Fourier series expansions and the Maclaurin series expansions of certain Jacobi elliptic functions. These sums can be expressed as rational polynomials of $Γ(1/4)$ and $π^{-1}$ which give rise to the closed formulas of the mixed Berndt-type integrals we are interested in. Moreover, we also present some interesting consequences and illustrative examples. Additionally, we define a generalized Barnes multiple zeta function, and find a classic integral representation of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function. Furthermore, we give an alternative evaluation of the mixed Berndt-type integrals in terms of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Matrix mutation of skew-symmetrizable matrices is foundational in cluster algebra theory. Effective mutation invariants are essential for determining whether two matrices lie in the same mutation class. Casals~\cite{Casals} introduced a binary mutation invariant for skew-symmetric matrices. In this paper, we extend Casals' construction to the skew-symmetrizable setting. When the skew-symmetrizer $d_1,\dots, d_n$ is pairwise coprime, we obtain two distinct extensions of this invariant.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The endomorphism algebras of the permutation modules for transitive permutation groups, known as Hecke algebras, are fundamental objects in representation theory. While group algebras are known to be symmetric over any field, it is natural to ask whether this property extends to Hecke algebras. To study this, we introduce the new concepts of $p$-$S$-permutation groups (for a prime $p$) and $S$-permutation groups. A \emph{ $p$-$S$-permutation group} is a transitive permutation group whose associated Hecke algebra is symmetric over every field of characteristic $p$. An \emph{ $S$-permutation group} is a transitive permutation group that is a $p$-$S$-permutation group for all primes $p$. In this paper, we study Hecke algebras from a group-theoretical perspective and we show that several classes of permutation groups are $p$-$S$-permutation groups and $S$-permutation groups in our sense. This result represents a substantial extension of earlier work by Li and He. (Transform Groups, 30(4), 2025), and reframes the question of determining when the algebra \(\End_{KG}(KΩ)\) is symmetric within a more general theoretical framework.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-03 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Antonio Bonelli &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables. Includes Python algorithm for complexity validation

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a structural resolution to the exact evaluation of the partition function $p_k(n)$, addressing the limitations of traditional recursive and asymptotic methods. By introducing the Simplicial Successive Decomposition (SSD) framework, we demonstrate that the partition polytope $\mathcal{P}_{n,k}$ is not an arbitrary geometric object, but admits a rigid minimal unimodular triangulation into exactly $N_k = \binom{k}{2}$ simplices. This cardinality is determined by the positive root system of the $A_{k-1}$ Weyl chamber.We decompose Euler's generating function into a finite sum of simplicial rational transforms. By applying Brion's localization theorem and the negative binomial expansion, we derive an exact closed-form formula with $O(1)$ computational complexity. The validity of the model is confirmed through Ehrhart-Macdonald reciprocity, ensuring accuracy in the "Core Collapse" regime where the polytope's interior is empty and continuous volume approximations are inapplicable.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Corrected coefficients in Theorem 2.1 and the derived results (including the main theorems). Also simplified the arguments by removing the unnecessary twisting by quadratic characters

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the existence of secondary terms of order $X^{5/6}$ in the asymptotic formulas for the average size of the genus number of cubic fields and for the number of cubic fields with a given genus number, establishing improved error estimates. These results refine the estimates obtained by McGown and Tucker. We also provide uniform estimates for the moments of the genus numbers of cubic fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we explicitly construct Maass wave cusp forms associated to Hecke characters on arbitrary real quadratic fields. This result is a generalization of Maass (1949), who constructed Maass wave cusp forms under the assumption that narrow class number is one. We also compute its Petersson inner product explicitly and give a few examples involving dihedral Artin representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study Leavitt path algebras over quivers with relations such as quantum Yang-Baxter equation, Hecke condition, and RTT conditions. This construction allows us to produce examples of Leavitt path algebras that contain quantum matrix algebra as subalgebra and obtain an algebraic analogue of the Hong-Szymański result. In particular, we show that the coordinate algebra over odd-dimensional Vaksman-Soibelman quantum sphere can be realized as the Zhang twist of a Leavitt path algebra over a quiver with such relations. Furthermore, we show that the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, and Hecke condition for our RTT construction can be generated intrinsically from the adjacency matrix of certain quivers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $Γ$ be a congruence subgroup of $SL_2(Z)$, and let $f$ be a normalized eigenform of weight $k$ on $Γ$. Let $K$ denote the number field generated over $Q$ by the Fourier coefficients of $f$. Let $R$ denote the the order in $K$ generated by the Fourier coefficients of $f$, which is contained in the ring of integers $O$ of $K$. We relate the primes that divide the index of $R$ in $O$ to primes $p$ such that $f$ is congruent to a conjugate of $f$ modulo a prime ideal of residue characteristic $p$. The index mentioned above is the same as the index of the quotient of the Hecke algebra by the annihilator ideal of $f$ in its normalization.</p></details>
