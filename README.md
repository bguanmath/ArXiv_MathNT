 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Eric Bucher, Elizabeth Howard &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cluster algebras, introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky through the process of quiver mutation, have become central objects in modern algebra and geometry, linking combinatorial constructions with diverse mathematical domains such as Teichmuller theory, total positivity, and even theoretical physics. Building on foundational work by Fomin, Shapiro, and Thurston connecting cluster algebras to triangulated surfaces, recent research has extended mutation theory to infinite settings, including the infinity-gon and more general marked surfaces. In this paper, we develop a purely combinatorial framework for mutation of infinite quivers, independent of but compatible with these topological constructions. By formalizing infinite quivers as limits of embedded finite quivers, we establish a consistent definition of mutation that generalizes prior surface-based results. We then apply this framework to extend the notion of reddening sequences, special mutation sequences with significant algebraic consequences, from the finite to the infinite setting. Our approach not only unifies previous topological and combinatorial perspectives but also provides a technical foundation for further generalizations of cluster algebra theory in the infinite case.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Bernhard Heim und Markus Neuhauser &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Improved Version (v2)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider infinite sequences of positive numbers. The connection between log-concavity and the Bessenrodt--Ono inequality had been in the focus of several papers. This has applications in the white noise distribution theory and combinatorics. We improve a recent result of Benfield and Roy and show that for the sequence of partition numbers $\{p(n)\}$ Nicolas' log-concavity result implies the result of Bessenrodt and Ono towards $p(n) \, p(m) > p(n+m)$. We provide several examples. Benfield and Roy gave a conjecture related to $\ell $-ary partition numbers. We prove part of this conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We adapt Caro's notion of overholonomicity to give a definition of holonomic D-cap-modules on rigid analytic spaces. We prove stability under five of the six operations (both inverse image functors, duality, and both direct image functors for projective morphisms), as well as base change results. Up to the open problem of stability under tensor products, we obtain an analogue of the usual six-functor formalism for holonomic D-modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that any smooth rigid analytic variety $X$ admits an affinoid covering $\{U_i\}$ such that the Banach algebras involved in the Fréchet--Stein presentation of the completed ring of differential operators D-cap$(U_i)$ are Auslander regular for each $i$. We use this result to prove projection formulae and adjunction results for coadmissible D-cap-modules.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v1: 40 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>G.-Pechenik-Pfannerer-Striker-Swanson applied hourglass plabic graphs to construct web bases for spaces of tensor invariants of fundamental representations of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_4)$, extending Kuperberg's celebrated basis for $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_3)$. We give several combinatorial characterizations of basis webs in the kernel of the projection to invariants in a tensor product of arbitrary (type $1$) irreducibles. We apply this to show that the nonzero images of basis webs form a basis (a property shared with Lusztig's dual canonical basis) yielding distinguished clasped web bases for each such tensor product.</p></details>

The associated Mathematica package can be downloaded from https://github.com/PyryKuusela/CY3Zeta

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The deformation approach of arXiv:2104.07816 for computing zeta functions of one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds is generalised to cover also multiparameter manifolds. Consideration of the multiparameter case requires the development of an improved formalism. This allows us, among other things, to make progress on some issues left open in previous work, such as the treatment of apparent and conifold singularities and changes of coordinates. We also discuss the efficient numerical computation of the zeta functions. As examples, we compute the zeta functions of the two-parameter mirror octic, a non-symmetric split of the quintic threefold also with two parameters, and the $S_5$ symmetric five-parameter Hulek-Verrill manifolds. These examples allow us to exhibit the several new types of geometries for which our methods make practical computations possible. They also act as consistency checks, as our results reproduce and extend those of arXiv:hep-th/0409202 and arXiv:math/0304169. To make the methods developed here more approachable, a Mathematica package "CY3Zeta" for computing the zeta functions of Calabi-Yau threefolds, which is attached to this paper, is presented.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In $2020$, Bhargava, Shankar, Taniguchi, Thorne, Tsimerman, and Zhao proved that for a finite extension $K/\mathbb{Q}$ of degree $n\geq 5$, the size of the $2$-torsion class group is bounded by $\# h_{2}(K)=O_{n,\varepsilon}(D_{K}^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2n}+\varepsilon})$, where $D_{K}$ is the absolute discriminant of $K$. In the present paper, we improve their bound by proving that $\# h_{2}(K)=O_{n,\varepsilon}(D_{K}^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2n}-δ_{K}+\varepsilon})$, for a constant $δ_{K}\geq\frac{1}{28n}-\frac{3}{28n(n-1)}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce total preprojective algebras $Ψ$ of path algebras of Dynkin quivers $kQ$, and prove that they are isomorphic to $2$-Auslander algebras of preprojective algebras $Π$ of $kQ$. In particular, $Ψ$ has global dimension $3$ and dominant dimension $3$. We also describe $Ψ$ as a tensor algebra of a certain explicit bimodule over the Auslander algebra of $kQ$. As an application, we give a presentation of $Ψ$ by explicit quivers with relations. More generally, we introduce total $(d+1)$-preprojective algebras of $d$-representation finite algebras, and give all the corresponding results.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Dung The Tran &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Raimi's classical theorem establishes a partition of the natural numbers with a remarkable unavoidability property: for every finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, there is a color class whose translate meets both parts of the partition in infinitely many points. Recently, Kang, Koh, and Tran have extended this phenomenon to the circle group, proving that there exists a measurable partition of the circle such that every finite measurable cover admits a rotation whose image meets each part of the partition in positive measure. This paper shows that this phenomenon extends beyond compact abelian groups to a wide class of non-group geometric surfaces that still exhibit \textit{a hidden one-dimensional symmetry}. Specifically, we establish analogs of Raimi's theorem for three families of surfaces (with their natural surface measures): the unit sphere $S^{n-1} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, rotational power surfaces (such as cones and paraboloids), and circular cylindrical surfaces. The common feature is that each of these surfaces carries a natural measure-preserving action of the circle group by rotation in a fixed plane and admits a measurable trivialization as a product $C \times Y$. This circle-bundle structure allows the measurable Raimi partition on the base circle to be lifted to an unavoidable partition on the manifold. Our approach is unified through a general circle-bundle theorem, which reduces all three geometric cases to verifying suitable equivariance and product disintegration properties of the surface measure.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Harris Daniels, Jeremy Rouse &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 29 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve. We say that $E$ has a near coincidence of level $(n,m)$ if $m \mid n$ and $\mathbb{Q}(E[n]) = \mathbb{Q}(E[m],ζ_{n})$. We classify near coincidences of prime power level and use this result to give a classification of values of $n$ for which ${\rm Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(E[n])/\mathbb{Q})$ is a nilpotent group. Along the way we prove a Gauss-Wantzel analog for the elliptic curve $E\colon y^2 = x^3-x$, showing that $\mathbb{Q}(E[n])/\mathbb{Q}$ is constructible if and only if $\varphi(n)$ is a power of 2. Assuming that there are no non-CM rational points on the modular curves $X_{ns}^{+}(p)$ for primes $p > 11$, we show that ${\rm Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(E[n])/\mathbb{Q})$ nilpotent implies that $n$ is a power of $2$ or $n \in \{ 3, 5, 6, 7, 15, 21 \}$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08631v1'>2512.08631</a>\]&nbsp; **The Stéphanois theorem with only prime isogenies**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Desirée Gijón Gómez &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 16 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a strengthening of the proof of the Stéphanois theorem. We follow the modular version by Waldschmidt, which is based in a suggestion by Daniel Bertrand, but it also applies to the original proof. The improvement is not in the result or the conditions, but in the need of weaker tools on the proof itself. More precisely, we only employ modular polynomials of prime degree, instead of polynomials of arbitrary level. Furthermore, one can restrict to primes in fixed arithmetic sequence. On the proof itself, the only crucial difference appears in Cinquième pas and on the final contradiction in Septième pas of Waldschmidt's proof, but for readability, we present a complete proof with this modification. This is part of a larger project to generalize the Stéphanois theorem to the Igusa invariants of curves of genus two, as the Siegel modular polynomials in the literature are usually only considered for prime levels. The material is part of Chapter 7 of the author's PhD thesis.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Mohammad Taha Kazemi Moghadam &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Major revision: 29 pages. New unconditional spectral proof of PFR/Marton in and ; finite-field case reorganized as a corollary and exposition expanded

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We settle the Polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa (PFR/Marton) conjecture for the integers and for cyclic groups. More precisely, we show that if $A$ is a finite subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ with $|A+A| \le K|A|$, then there is a subgroup $H$ of index at most $K^{O(1)}$ such that $A$ is contained in at most $K^{O(1)}$ cosets of $H$. The proof is based on a new spectral stability dichotomy for the $L^4$ Fourier mass of $\mathbf{1}_A$: either this mass is concentrated on a span of size $K^{O(1)}$, or, after passing to a quotient of codimension $K^{O(1)}$, the doubling constant of the image of $A$ decreases by a definite power of $K$. Using Freiman modeling we transfer this dichotomy to cyclic groups, obtain polynomial Bogolyubov-type bounds, and deduce Marton's conjecture in $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$. As a corollary, we also recover and extend the finite-field formulation of Marton's conjecture: in odd characteristic we obtain a direct spectral proof, and together with the characteristic-2 result of Green, Gowers, Manners, and Tao this yields a complete resolution of the conjecture for all finite fields. For context beyond finite fields, we recall their theorem for abelian groups of bounded exponent.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Li Lu, Lingyu Guo, Victor Z. Guo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a new bound to the exponential sum of the form $$ \sum_{h \sim H}δ_h \mathop{\sum_{m\sim M}\sum_{n\sim N}}_{mn\sim x}a_{m}b_{n}\e\big(αmn + h(mn + u)^γ\big), $$ by a new approach to the Type I sum. The sum can be applied to many problems related to Piatetski-Shapiro primes, which are primes of the form $\lfloor n^c \rfloor$. In this paper, we improve the admissible range of the Balog-Friedlander condition, which leads to an improvement to the ternary Goldbach problem with Piatetski-Shapiro primes. We also investigate the distribution of Piatetski-Shapiro primes in arithmetic progressions, Piatetski-Shapiro primes in the intersection of multiple Beatty sequences and so on.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Final proofreading before submission to a journal

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Conjectures of Braverman and Kazhdan, Ngô and Sakellaridis have motivated the development of Schwartz spaces for certain spherical varieties. We prove that under suitable assumptions these Schwartz spaces are naturally a representation of a group that we christen the modulation group. This provides a broad generalization of the defining representation of the metaplectic group. The example of a vector space and the zero locus of a quadric cone in an even number of variables are discussed in detail. In both of these cases the modulation group is closely related to algebraic groups, and we propose a conjectural method of linking modulation groups to ind-algebraic groups in general. At the end of the paper we discuss adelization and the relationship between representations of modulation groups and the Poisson summation conjecture.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define several versions of a class of varieties $X_{\mathfrak{g}}$ attached to a complex reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, generalizing the Hilbert scheme of points on the plane. These include trigonometric and elliptic versions attached to the corresponding groups. We also define the corresponding isospectral varieties $Y_{\mathfrak{g}}$. We prove a Gordon-Stafford localization theorem for $X_{\mathfrak{g}}$ and the corresponding equal-parameter rational Cherednik algebras, relate these varieties to the affine Springer fiber-sheaf correspondence of arXiv:2204.00303, and discuss examples. We conjecture that the torus-fixed points of our varieties are in bijection with two-sided cells in the finite Weyl group and prove this in types $ABC$. We relate these results to known results about Calogero-Moser spaces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe the dimensions of Hochschild (co)homology groups of weighted projective curves over complex numbers. Surprisingly, all but one of those numbers depend only on the genus of the underlying non-weighted curve and the number of exceptional points.

We give concrete realizations of a large class of weighted projective lines as quotient stacks.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove two fast formulas for the Hurwitz values $ζ(2,a)$ and $ζ(3,a)$ respectively with the help of the WZ method. In them $(a)_n$ denotes the rising factorial or Pochhammer's symbol defined by $(a)_0=1$ and $(a)_n=a(a+1)\cdots(a+n-1)$ for positive integers $n$. The Huwitz $ζ$ function is defined by $ζ(s,a)=ζ(0,s,a)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (k+a)^{-s}$. In addition, we can use these fast evaluations to compute also in a rapid way Dirichlet values of the kinds $L_χ(2)$ and $L_χ(3)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the $L_p$-discrepancy of random point sets in high dimensions, with emphasis on small values of $p$. Although the classical $L_p$-discrepancy suffers from the curse of dimensionality for all $p \in (1,\infty)$, the gap between known upper and lower bounds remains substantial, in particular for small $p \ge 1$. To clarify this picture, we review the existing results for i.i.d.\ uniformly distributed points and derive new upper bounds for \emph{generalized} $L_p$-discrepancies, obtained by allowing non-uniform sampling densities and corresponding non-negative quadrature weights. Using the probabilistic method, we show that random points drawn from optimally chosen product densities lead to significantly improved upper bounds. For $p=2$ these bounds are explicit and optimal; for general $p \in [1,\infty)$ we obtain sharp asymptotic estimates. The improvement can be interpreted as a form of importance sampling for the underlying Sobolev space $F_{d,q}$. Our results also reveal that, even with optimal densities, the curse of dimensionality persists for random points when $p\ge 1$, and it becomes most pronounced for small $p$. This suggests that the curse should also hold for the classical $L_1$-discrepancy for deterministic point sets.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hamilton Wan &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 101 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We undertake the study of complex rank analogues of parabolic category O defined using Deligne categories. We regard these categories as a family over an affine space, introduce a stratification on this parameter space, and formulate conjectures on the structural constancy of fibers on each stratum. Using the theory of $\mathfrak{sl}_{\mathbb{Z}}$-categorification, we prove these conjectures for admissible strata. Namely, we axiomatize the notion of multi-Fock tensor product categorifications (MFTPCs), which are interval finite highest weight categories equipped with a compatible action of commuting copies of $\mathfrak{sl}_{\mathbb{Z}}$, categorifying an external tensor product of tensor products of highest and lowest weight Fock space representations. We prove a uniqueness theorem for admissible MFTPCs and show that complex rank parabolic categories O have the structure of MFTPCs. In turn, for suitable choices of parameters, we produce an equivalence of complex rank category O with a stable limit of classical parabolic categories O, resolving our conjecture in the admissible case. These equivalences yield multiplicities of simple objects in Verma modules in terms of stable parabolic Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials, answering a question posed by Etingof. In particular, for the case of two Levi blocks of non-integral size, we completely describe the structure of the corresponding category O in terms of stable representation theory. As an application, we obtain multiplicities for parabolic analogs of hyperalgebra Verma modules introduced by Haboush in the large rank and large characteristic limit.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime number. If a number field $k$ has at least one complex place, there are infinitely many $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions over $k$, and some authors studied the behavior of Iwasawa invariants of these $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions. In particular, Fujii studied the case where $k$ is an imaginary quadratic field and obtained some results on the boundedness of Iwasawa $λ$-invariants in a certain infinite family of $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions. In the present article, we give analogous theorems in the case where $k$ is a quartic CM-field. One of our main theorems determines all the Iwasawa invariants, including the $ν$-invariants, of a certain infinite family of $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions over a quartic CM-field.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 38 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $ E $ be an elliptic curve defined over a number field, the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD, for short) asserts a deep relation between the group $ E(K) $ of rational points and the $ L-$function $ L(E/K, s)$ of $ E $ at $ s = 1. $ Very few explicit results about $ E(K) $ and $ L(1) $ are known, even no general method is known to determine $ L(1) $ vanishing or not for a given elliptic curve. In this paper, we study some quantities related to BSD of a special class of elliptic curves, more precisely, we study the arithmetic of quadratic twists of elliptic curves $ y^{2} = x(x + \varepsilon p )(x + \varepsilon q) $ and their $L-$function. Based on some classical works, especially those of Greenberg, Kramer-Tunnell, Kato-Rohrlich, Manin and Mazur, under some conditions, we obtain results about the vanishing of the value at $ s = 1 $ of the $ L$-function, and explicitly determine the following quantities: the norm index $ δ(E, \Q, K), $ the root numbers, the set of anomalous prime numbers, a few prime numbers at which the image of Galois representation are surjective. We also study the relation between the ranks of the Mordell-Weil groups, Selmer groups and Shafarevich-Tate groups, and the structure about the $ l^{\infty }-$Selmer groups and the Mordell-Weil groups over $ \Z_{l}-$extension via Iwasawa theory. These results provide some useful evidence toward verifying the BSD for a family of elliptic curves.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 107 pages. Comments welcome! Introduction improved to reflect and highlight the new results. Some lemmas slighly simplified

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a robust structure theory for multiple ergodic averages of commuting transformations along Hardy sequences of polynomial growth. We then apply it to derive a number of novel results on joint ergodicity, recurrence and convergence. In particular, we prove joint ergodicity for (a) pairwise independent Hardy sequences and weakly mixing transformations, (b) strongly independent Hardy sequences and ergodic transformations, (c) strongly irrationally independent Hardy sequences and totally ergodic transformations. We use these joint ergodicity results to provide new recurrence results for multidimensional patterns along strongly independent Hardy sequences, showing for instance that all subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ of positive upper density contain patterns of the form $$ (m_1, m_2),\; (m_1 + \lfloor n^{\sqrt{2}}\rfloor, m_2),\; (m_1, m_2 + \lfloor n^{\sqrt{2}} + n^{1/2}\rfloor).$$ Last but not least, we positively resolve the joint ergodicity classification problem for pairwise independent Hardy sequences, of which the aforementioned families are special cases. While building on recent technical advances (e.g. PET coefficient tracking schemes and joint ergodicity criteria), our work introduces a number of technical developments of its own. We construct a suitable generalization of Host-Kra and box seminorms that quantitatively control ergodic averages along Hardy sequences. We subsequently use them to obtain Host-Kra seminorm estimates for averages along all pairwise independent Hardy sequences. Furthermore, we develop an ergodic version of the quantitative concatenation argument that has recently found extensive use in combinatorics, number theory and harmonic analysis. Lastly, we obtain new simultaneous Taylor approximations for Hardy sequences, a crucial ingredient to deal with the aforementioned classes of Hardy sequences.</p></details>

> **Comment:** The initial article has been split into two parts: this is part one, constructing geometric universal invariants for knots, and comes with a second part, providing universal link invariants. 58 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct geometrically a universal Jones invariant as a limit of invariants given by graded intersections in configuration spaces. For any fixed level $\mathscr N$, we define a new knot invariant, called ``$\mathscr N^{th}$ Unified Jones invariant'' globalising topologically all coloured Jones polynomials at levels less than $\mathscr N$. It is defined via the intersection points between {Lagrangian submanifolds} supported on arcs and ovals in the disc. The geometry of these Lagrangians is novel: previous topological models involved immersed submanifolds rather than embedded ones. We do this by defining a new local system that refines the Lawrence representation, and depends of the distribution of multiplicities of points in the configuration space on the ovals. On the algebraic side, Habiro's famous invariant for knots \cite{H3} is a universal invariant globalising the family of coloured Jones polynomials. He conjectured that this universal invariant recovers also the ADO invariant divided by the Alexander polynomials, which was proved by Willetts \cite{W} in a version of Habiro's ring (\cite{H2}). The universal Jones invariant that we construct belongs to a different ring that comes with a map to Habiro's ring \cite{H2}. We prove that our invariant recovers this version of Habiro's invariant. The difference is that our invariant is given as a limit of new knot invariants, the $\mathscr N^{th}$ unified Jones invariants. These invariants in turn provide a geometrical understanding of sets of all coloured Jones polynomials of bounded colour, collecting more information as we increase the colour.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 54 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct geometrically two universal link invariants: universal ADO invariant and universal Jones invariant, as limits of invariants given by graded intersections in configuration spaces. More specifically, for a fixed level $\mathscr N$, we define new link invariants: ``$\mathscr N^{th}$ Unified Jones invariant'' and ``$\mathscr N^{th}$ Unified Alexander invariant''. They globalise topologically all coloured Jones polynomials for links with multi-colours bounded by $\mathscr N$ and all ADO polynomials with bounded colours. These invariants both come from the same weighted Lagrangian intersection supported on configurations on arcs and ovals in the disc. The question of providing a universal non semi-simple link invariant, recovering all the ADO polynomials was an open problem. A parallel question about semi-simple invariants for the case of knots is the subject of Habiro's famous universal knot invariant \cite{H3}. Habiro's universal construction is well defined for knots and can be extended just for certain classes of links. Our universal Jones link invariant is defined for any link and recovers all coloured Jones polynomials, providing a new semi-simple universal link invariant. The first non semi-simple universal link invariant that we construct unifies all ADO invariants for links, answering the open problem about the globalisation of these invariants.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study a natural class of Anderson t- modules, called triangular t-modules, characterized by having Drinfeld modules as their $τ$-composition factors. They form a homologically meaningful generalization of Drinfeld modules and exhibit rich arithmetic structure.\smallskip We establish criteria for purity, strict and almost strict, and develop a reduction procedure that lowers the degrees of the defining biderivations. As a consequence, every almost strictly pure triangular t-module becomes strictly pure after a finite base extension. We then investigate morphisms and isogenies between triangular t-modules, provide a characterization of triangular isogenies, and describe the algebra of endomorphisms, including a criterion for commutativity. On the analytic side, we show that all triangular t- modules are uniformizable and establish finiteness and purity criteria with consequences for Taelman's conjecture. Finally, we develop a duality theory for triangular t- modules and their biderivations, proving compatibility with $τ$-composition series and establishing analogues of the Cartier-Nishi theorem and the Weil-Barsotti formula.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The aim of this study is to show that harmonic geometric polynomials can be represented in terms of geometric polynomials. This problem was first considered by Keller [14]; however, the corresponding coefficients were not fully determined. In the present work, we provide several explicit representations of harmonic geometric polynomials in terms of geometric polynomials. Moreover, several applications of one of these representations are subsequently developed. In particular, we obtain a generalization of the classical identity for the harmonic numbers, compute an integral involving harmonic geometric polynomials and an integral involving products of harmonic geometric and geometric polynomials in terms of Bernoulli numbers. These integral formulas lead to new explicit expressions for Bernoulli numbers. In addition, we give several recurrence relations for harmonic geometric polynomials and evaluate a finite sum involving harmonic numbers and positive powers of integers.</p></details>

We prove that these formulations are equivalent. We further show that if a functorial equivalence between a block with abelian defect group and its Brauer correspondent descends to the minimal field of the block, then the BGAWC holds for that block.

The cominuscule case is an easy application of the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem, following results of Snow.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish asymptotic formulas for sums of reciprocals of primes in arithmetic progressions, generalizing recent results on multiple Mertens evaluations by Tenenbaum, Qi, and Hu. Specifically, for any fixed constant $K>0$, we derive asymptotic expansions for the sums $ \sum_{\substack{p_1\cdots p_n\leq x \\ p_i\equiv h_i \pmod{m_i} \\ i=1,\dots, n}}\frac{1}{p_1\cdots p_n} $ and the corresponding log-weighted sums. A key feature of our results is that the error terms hold \emph{uniformly} for moduli satisfying $m_i \le (\log x)^K$, a range accessible via the Siegel-Walfisz theorem. Furthermore, we identify the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion with the Taylor series of the reciprocal Gamma function, $1/Γ(z)$, providing a structural explanation for the lower-order terms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For two countably infinite fields whose multiplicative groups are isomorphic, we examine invariant couplings between the actions that these groups induce on the additive Pontryagin duals of the fields. We show that the actions are disjoint unless the fields themselves are isomorphic and the group isomorphism extends (possibly after a finite twist) to a field isomorphism. As an application, we establish equidistribution of Følner-Kloosterman sums - an extension of classical Kloosterman sums to infinite fields. Unlike the classical case over algebraic closures of finite fields, these averages exhibit an inherent multiplicative asymmetry, revealing new and fundamentally different behavior. Finally, we derive several combinatorial consequences, including results on sum-product phenomena and a Furstenberg--Sárközy-type theorem for Laurent polynomials over general fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The representation theory of left regular band semigroup algebras is well-studied and known to have close connections with combinatorial topology, as established in the work of Margolis--Saliola--Steinberg ('15, '21). In this paper, we investigate the representation theory of the invariant subalgebras of left regular band semigroup algebras carrying the action of a finite group through the lens of group-equivariant combinatorial topology. We characterize when the invariant subalgebra is semisimple or commutative and examine the equivariant structure of the Peirce components of the semigroup algebra. For CW left regular bands, we interpret these Peirce components in terms of the equivariant topology of intervals in the support semilattice, yielding the Cartan invariants of the invariant subalgebras of left regular bands associated to CAT(0)-cube complexes. We also give a topological formula for the Peirce components for left regular bands with hereditary algebras. Finally, in specializing to left regular bands associated to geometric lattices, we explore generalizations of the Desarménién--Wachs derangement representation and their connections to Markov chains.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G(k)$ be the split form of the simple exceptional p-adic group of type $F_4$, and let $\mathcal O = F_4(a_3)$ be the minimal distinguished nilpotent orbit. Our main result concerns the class of unipotent representations with cuspidal support at infinitesimal character $Λ$ determined by $\mathcal O$. These representations are parameterized by local systems, $\{(S, \mathcal L)\}$. We compute the characteristic cycles of the perverse sheaves $\text{IC}(S, \mathcal L)$ and determine all micro-packets in the sense of [Vo93]. In [CMBO24], the authors introduced a notion of weak Arthur packets in the p-adic setting. They conjectured that weak Arthur packets are unions of Arthur packets, in an appropriate sense. We verify that weak Arthur packets are unions of micro-packets.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 19 pages, 3 figures. Material on sets with squarefree sums shortened due to overlap with existing literature

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We answer several questions of Erdős regarding sequences of natural numbers $A$ whose translates $n+A$ intersect with the squarefree numbers in various specified ways. For instance, we show that if every translate only contains finitely many squarefree numbers, then $A$ has zero density, although the decay rate of this density can be arbitrarily slow. On the other hand, there exist sequences $A$ with optimal density $6/π^2$ for which infinitely many $n$ exist such that $n+a$ is squarefree for all $a \in A$ with $a < n$. In fact, infinitely many such $n$ exist for every exponentially increasing sequence, as long as the sequence avoids at least one residue class modulo $p^2$ for all primes $p$, a property we call admissible. If one instead requires infinitely many $n$ to exist such that $n+a$ is squarefree for all $a \in A$, then $A$ can have density arbitrarily close to, but not equal to, $6/π^2$. Finally, we prove bounds on the growth rate of sequences $A$ for which $a+a'$ is squarefree for all $a,a' \in A$, as well as bounds on the largest admissible subset of $\{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper concerns extension of the classical Lagrange theorem, on the eventual periodicity of continued fraction expansions of quadratic surds, and the versions of it found in the literature in the case of complex numbers. In this respect, firstly, we adopt a more general notion of continued fraction expansions, in place of those arising from the nearest integer algorithms. Secondly, the issue is formulated in terms of zeros of quadratic and Hermitian forms, and a result is proved in terms of certain sequences of matrices associated with them, via continued fraction expansions. The result may be considered as a matrix analogue of Lagrange's theorem in the general framework. The unified approach leads to generalizations of the Lagrange theorem on one hand, and an extended version of a result of Hines (2019) on badly approximable complex numbers, on the other hand.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The category $\bcalNT$ is a category of certain commutative graded algebras over a field. It was introduced in \cite{Lobos2} as a generalization of algebras generated by Jucys-Murphy elements in the many \textbf{End} algebras of the diagrammatic Soergel category of Elias and Williamson. In the first part of this article we define certain \emph{Invariants} for the isomorphism classes in $\bcalNT,$ following in the same spirit of \cite{Lobos3}, where a series of \emph{Isomorphism criteria} were found. At the end, we use our invariants to provide a new lower bound for the number of isomorphism classes, improving a similar result obtained in \cite{Lobos3}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A filtration of the morphisms of the $k$-linearization $k \mathbf{FS}$ of the category $\mathbf{FS}$ of finite sets and surjections is constructed using a natural $k \mathbf{FI}^{op}$-module structure induced by restriction, where $\mathbf{FI}$ is the category of finite sets and injections. In particular, this yields the `primitive' subcategory $ k \mathbf{FS}^0 \subset k \mathbf{FS}$ that is of independent interest; for example, the category of $k \mathbf{FS}^0$-modules is closely related to the category of $k \mathbf{FA}$-modules, where $\mathbf{FA}$ is the category of finite sets and all maps. Working over a field of characteristic zero, the subquotients of this filtration are identified as bimodules over $k \mathbf{FB}$, where $\mathbf{FB}$ is the category of finite sets and bijections, also exhibiting and exploiting additional structure. In particular, this describes the underlying $k \mathbf{FB}$-bimodule of $k \mathbf{FS}^0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\lfloor x\rfloor$ denote the integer part of $x$. For every sequence $(C_k)_{k\ge 1}$ of positive integers, we define $ξ(C_k)$ as the smallest real number $ξ>1$ such that $\lfloor ξ^{C_k} \rfloor$ is a prime number for every positive integer $k$. The number $ξ(3^k)$ is called Mills' constant. Recently, the author showed that $ξ(3^k)$ is irrational; however, the transcendency remains open. In this paper, we show that Mills' constant is transcendental under the Density Hypothesis of the Riemann zeta function. Furthermore, we obtain four classes of sequences $(C_k)_{k\ge 1}$ for which we can verify the arithmetic properties of $ξ(C_k)$. For simplicity, we give four representative examples belonging to each class: (A) $ξ(\lfloor b^k\rfloor)$ is irrational for every real number $b\ge 1+\sqrt{2}$; (B) $ξ((1+\sqrt{2})^k+(1-\sqrt{2})^k)$ is transcendental; (C) $ξ(r3^k-1)$ is transcendental for every integer $r\ge 4.003\times 10^{14}$; (D) $ξ(3^{k-\lfloor (\log k)^{1/2} \rfloor}2^{\lfloor (\log k)^{1/2}\rfloor})$ is transcendental.</p></details>

If $k$ admits a finite separable field extension $K/k$ such that $K$ is algebraically closed, the real number field for example, we prove that $A$ is $\mathbf{C}$-dichotomic.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define the notion of a non-abelian Jacobi sum $\mathcal{J}^{\mathrm{dbl}}\left(π, χ\right)$ attached to an irreducible representation $π$ of a general linear group or a classical group over a finite field and a character $χ$ of the multiplicative group of the finite field or its quadratic extension. These sums emerge in the study of the doubling method of Piatetski-Shapiro--Rallis and Lapid--Rallis. For general linear groups, we express these non-abelian Jacobi sums in terms of Kondo's non-abelian Gauss sums. For classical groups and for characters that are not conjugate-dual, we give an explicit formula for these non-abelian Jacobi sums in terms of Gauss sums attached to the Deligne--Lusztig data of the representation, and we prove that these Jacobi sums are constant on geometric Lusztig series.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Diophantine equation $a^k + b^k = c^k + d^k$ with integer variables and exponent $k>1$, under the linear constraint $(c+d) - (a+b) = h$. We analyze the geometry and arithmetic of these linear slices. On the central slice $h=0$, we prove strictly convex uniqueness: distinct unordered pairs with the same sum yield distinct power sums. For shifted slices $h\neq 0$, we establish a Modular Divisibility Obstruction (MDO): any solution requires $h$ to be divisible by a specific squarefree modulus $M_k = \prod_{p-1 \mid k-1} p$. This condition creates a strong divisibility filter; for example, if $k=13$, the obstruction eliminates $99.96\%$ of all possible shifts. We combine this arithmetic constraint with a geometric exclusion zone principle and a global overlap bound, showing that the slice size must satisfy $\min\{S, S+h\} \gg |h|$. Finally, we prove an asymptotic dominance bound $k \le \max\{S, S+h\} \log 2$, implying that for any fixed slice, solutions cannot exist for sufficiently large $k$.</p></details>

We establish several fundamental structural results: scalar extensions preserve both the algebraic structure and simplicity; intermediate subalgebras associated with subgroups $\ZZ \subseteq \cB \subseteq \cA$ remain simple; the algebra of graded derivations is isomorphic to a semidirect product $\Weyl{e^{\pm x^p e^{t}},\; e^{\cA x},\; x^{\cA}} \rtimes \FF^n$; tensor products over disjoint variable sets decompose naturally into larger algebras; and a complete isomorphism criterion is given, showing that isomorphism depends precisely on the orbit of the parameter $p$ under the automorphism group of $\cA$ and the equality of the deformation parameter $t$. These theorems generalize classical results on Weyl and Witt algebras, provide new families of simple algebras, and offer a foundation for further research in deformation theory, representation theory, and cohomology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper introduces and systematically studies a class of Weyl-type algebras enriched with exponential and power generators over a field of characteristic zero, defined as $A_{p,t,\cA} = \Weyl{e^{\pm x^{p} e^{t}},\; e^{\cA x},\; x^{\cA}}$ in the associative setting and $\Nass{e^{\pm x^{p} e^{t}},\; e^{\cA x},\; x^{\cA}}$ in a non-associative framework. We establish fundamental structural properties, including the triviality of the center for the non-associative version and the explicit description $Z(A_{p,t,\cA}) = \FF[e^{\pm x^{p} e^{t}}]$ for the associative one, proving that $A_{p,t,\cA}$ is an Azumaya algebra over its center and represents a nontrivial class in the Brauer group $\Br(\FF(y))$. Furthermore, we compute the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension for relevant examples and demonstrate its key properties, such as additivity under tensor products and the growth dichotomy. We completely characterize the automorphism group of $A_{p,t,\cA}$ as a semidirect product of a torus with a discrete group, and provide a sharp isomorphism criterion showing that the parameter $t$ is a complete invariant in the family. The paper concludes with two open problems concerning the GK dimension of non-associative exponential algebras and the classification of their deformations, pointing toward future research directions in non-associative growth theory and deformation rigidity.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Shaolong Han &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We derive Rogers--Ramanujan type partition identities at the fundamental weight $Λ_0$ for the exceptional affine types $G_2^{(1)}$, $D_4^{(3)}$, $F_4^{(1)}$, $E_6^{(2)}$, $E_6^{(1)}$, $E_7^{(1)}$ and $E_8^{(1)}$. Our starting point is the Dousse--Konan reformulation of the $(\mathrm{KMN})^2$ crystal character formula, applied to the level-one perfect crystal $B=B(θ)\sqcup B(0)$ of Benkart--Frenkel--Kang--Lee with ground element $φ\in B(0)$. This realizes the normalized character $e^{-Λ_0}\mathrm{ch} L(Λ_0)$ as generating functions of grounded $B$-colored partitions governed locally by the crystal energy. After principal specialization, we obtain a colored partition model subject to explicit difference, congruence, and initial conditions. On the product side, under the same specialization, the Weyl--Kac character formula yields an explicit Euler-type product, equivalently the generating function for partitions with parts in a concrete allowed set. Comparing the two specializations gives coefficientwise equalities of generating functions. A key computational feature is that the difference matrix can be produced from the crystal data without explicitly computing the energy function. For each type we tabulate the congruence data, forbidden initial parts, and the full difference matrix, and we provide reproducible coefficient checks.</p></details>
