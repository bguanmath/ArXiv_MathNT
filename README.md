> **Comment:** Part I of a series. Comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate $p$-adic automorphic forms on unitary groups through the geometry of infinite-level unitary Shimura varieties and the Hodge-Tate period map. We first develop a perfectoid construction of overconvergent automorphic forms. Building on this, we establish a canonical overconvergent Eichler-Shimura map linking overconvergent cohomology to these $p$-adic automorphic forms. This map induces a comparison between the corresponding coherent sheaves on the eigenvariety, with applications to the study of its geometry and to $p$-adic $L$-functions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zuo Lin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DS &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Main result is extended to quotients of perfect Lie groups. Title and abstract changed. 74 pages, 1 figure. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2508.06705

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an effective equidistribution theorem for orbits of certain unipotent subgroups in arithmetic quotients of perfect Lie groups with a polynomial error term. Even for semisimple quotients, our result provides the first infinite family of examples where effective equidistribution with polynomial error rate is obtained for non-horospherical unipotent subgroups. The proof is based on the spectral gap of the ambient space, an effective closing lemma, Bourgain's discretized projection theorem, and a sub-modularity inequality in irreducible representation. The sub-modularity inequality is crucial to our proof and is of independent interest. As applications, we obtain effective estimates on distribution of lattice orbits on homogeneous spaces, as well as an effective version of the Oppenheim conjecture for indefinite quadratic forms with a polynomial error rate in all dimension $d \geq 3$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Aishik Chattopadhyay &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We improve upon our previous result \cite{Ch} on short character sums over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$. Specifically, we show that for intervals $I_1,I_2,\ldots,I_k$ of lengths of at least $p^{n/4k+\varepsilon}$ and $k\leq n$, the sum $$ \sum_{x_0\in I_0,\; x_1\in I_1,\;\ldots,\; x_{k}\in I_{k}} χ\!\bigl(x_1ω_1 + x_2ω_2 + \cdots + x_{k}ω_{k}\bigr) $$ exhibits nontrivial cancellation, where $\{ω_1,\ldots,ω_n\}$ is any basis of $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$. More generally, let $|I_1|\le |I_2|\le \cdots \le |I_n| \le \sqrt{p/2}$ and fix $\varepsilon>0$ such that $ |I_1|\cdots|I_n| \ge p^{\,n(1/4+\varepsilon)}. $ Then, for any nontrivial multiplicative character $χ$ of $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, we have $$ \Biggl|\sum_{x_1\in I_1,\;\ldots,\;x_n\in I_n} χ\!\Bigl(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i ω_i\Bigr)\Biggr| \;\ll\; |I_1|\cdots|I_n|\, p^{-δ(\varepsilon)}, $$ where $$ δ(\varepsilon) = \varepsilon^2 \frac{1-\frac{1}{2n}}{\left(1+\frac{1}{4n}\right)\left(2-\frac{1}{2n}\right)}. $$ The proof relies on Minkowski's second theorem, which is applied to estimate the multiplicative energy of sets arising from products of intervals.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article studies the set of R-equivalence classes of the group of proper projective similitudes of an algebra with involution of the first kind. The main results concern base fields of characteristic different from 2 over which every 9-dimensional quadratic form has a nontrivial zero. This includes function fields of p-adic curves and extensions of transcendence degree 3 of C. Main results of [28] and [29] are extended by relaxing the condition on the base field as well as on the Clifford invariant for orthogonal involutions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 8 pages, 1 figure; Revised the title, added a supplement to Theorem 3, and corrected a few misprints

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $m,$ $n \geq 2$ be integers, and let $R$ be a subring of $\mathbb R$ with field of fractions $F.$ In this article, we generalize the rational angle bisection problem previously proposed by the author as follows: characterize the pairs of linearly independent vectors $\vec{a},$ $\vec{b} \in R^n$ that form angles with sequences of $m$-sector vectors lying in $R^n.$ When $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ are nonorthogonal, we prove that this condition is equivalent to the existence of a root in $F$ of a certain $m$-th degree polynomial over $R.$ In particular, when $R = \mathbb Z,$ the condition holds if and only if the polynomial has a root among the divisors of its constant term. When $m = 2^e$ with integer $e \geq 1,$ we also prove that the condition is equivalent to $\cos (θ/2^{e-1}) \in F,$ where $θ$ is the angle between $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}.$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that for any polynomial $f: \mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Z}$ with positive leading coefficient and irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, if $N$ is large enough then there are two strings of consecutive positive integers $I_{1}=\{n_1-m,\ldots, n_1+m\}$ and $I_{2}=\{n_2-m, \ldots, n_2+m\}$, such that $m = [(\log N) (\log \log N)^{1/325525}]$, $I_{1}\cup I_{2} \subset [1, N]$, $N = n_1 + n_2$, and $f(n)$ is composite for any $n\in I_{1}\cup I_{2}$. This extends the result in [5] which showed the same result but with $f(n)=n$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Buyan Li, Jie Xiao &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 40 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is a continuation of [5]. Using the root categories, we define the compact real forms of the complex semisimple Lie algebras, and maximal compact subgroups of the Chevalley groups over $\mathbb{C}$. In [7], Lusztig used the modified quantum group $\dot{\mathbf{U}}$ and its canonical basis to obtain the reductive group and its coordinate ring $\mathbf{O}_A$, in particular the tensor product decomposition of $\mathbf{O}_A$. By combining these two kinds of structures, we explore in this paper how the classical theory of the compact Lie groups, such as Peter-Weyl theorem and Plancherel theorem, can be recovered completely.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Antonio Bonelli &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 9 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables. Updated version: Unifies Prime and Composite cases via the Rational Structure Theorem. Includes Python implementation

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a structural resolution to the exact evaluation of the restricted partition function $p_k(n)$, addressing the computational limitations of traditional recursive and asymptotic methods. By introducing the Simplicial Spectral Decomposition, we demonstrate that the partition polytope $\mathcal{P}_{n,k}$ admits a rigid minimal unimodular triangulation governed by the $A_{k-1}$ Weyl chamber. We prove the Rational Structure Theorem, establishing that the generating function of the spectral weights is always a rational function defined over cyclotomic fields. Consequently, the sequence of weights is a quasipolynomial (ultimately periodic) for all $k$. This result unifies the treatment of prime and composite $k$, showing that the computational complexity of evaluating $p_k(n)$ is strictly $O(1)$ with respect to $n$. We provide explicit formulas and a generalized algorithm verified against Euler's recurrence.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages, polished version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An integer-valued polynomial $P(x,y,z)$ is said to be universal (over $\mathbb Z$) if each nonnegative integer can be written as $P(x,y,z)$ with $x,y,z\in\mathbb Z$. In this paper, we mainly introduce a new technique to determine the universality of some sums in the form $x(a_1x+a_2)/2+y(b_1y+b_2)/2+z(c_1z+c_2)/2$ (with $a_1-a_2,b_1-b_2,c_1-c_2$ all even) conjectured by Sun, using various identities of Ramanujan's theta functions. For example, we prove that $x(3x+1)+y(3y+2)+2z(3z+2)$ and $x(4x+r)+y(3y+1)/2+z(7z+1)/2\ (r=1,3)$ are universal.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the Fukaya-Seidel categories of a certain family of singularities on $\mathbb{C}^d$ are equivalent to the perfect derived categories of higher Auslander algebras of Dynkin type A. We relate these to the Fukaya-Seidel categories of Brieskorn-Pham singularities and to the partially wrapped Fukaya categories considered by Dyckerhoff-Jasso-Lekili. We provide a symplectic interpretation to higher Auslander correspondence of type A in terms of Fukaya-Seidel categories of Lefschetz fibrations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Since the curve $y^2 = x^6+1$ has a large automorphism group, there exist twist families arising from non-hyperelliptic directions. In this paper, we give an explicit upper bound on the average analytic rank of such a family, assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis for the $L$-functions. Also, we propose an analogue of the Goldfeld conjecture for the family following Katz--Sarnak philosophy.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 75 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the average distribution of primes of size $x$ in arithmetic progressions to moduli larger than $x^{\frac{1}{2}}$. Using arithmetic information from the works of many authors together with different variants of the original Harman's sieve, we construct suitable majorants and minorants for the prime indicator function $\mathbbm{1}_{p}(n)$ that satisfy Bombieri--Vinogradov type mean value theorems with different types of moduli. Specifically, we obtain some mean value theorems for primes with bilinear forms of moduli up to $x^{\frac{9}{17}}$ or with trilinear forms of moduli up to $x^{\frac{17}{32}}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This version corrects a mistake in the proof of Theorem 1b) and a typo in Proposition 7. All the statements are unchanged from the previous version. We thank Jakub Löwut for pointing out the issue in Theorem 1b)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We explain (following V. Drinfeld) how the equivariant derived category of the affine Grassmannian can be described in terms of coherent sheaves on the Langlands dual Lie algebra equivariant with respect to the adjoint action, due to some old results of V. Ginzburg. The global cohomology functor corresponds under this identification to restricti on to the Kostant slice. We extend this description to loop rotation equivariant derived category, linking it to Harish-Chandra bimodules for the Langlands dual Lie algebra, so that the global cohomology functor corresponds to the quantum Kostant-Whittaker reduction of a Harish-Chandra bimodule. We derive a conjecture from math.AG/0306413 which identifies the loop-rotation equivariant homology of the affine Grassmannian with quantized completed Toda lattice.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Emmanuel Abbe, Colin Sandon, Vladyslav Shashkov, Maryna Viazovska &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** cs.IT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1948, Shannon used a probabilistic argument to show the existence of codes achieving a maximal rate defined by the channel capacity. In 1954, Muller and Reed introduced a simple deterministic code construction based on polynomial evaluations, which was conjectured and eventually proven to achieve capacity. Meanwhile, polarization theory emerged as an analytic framework to prove capacity results for a variation of RM codes - the polar codes. Polarization theory further gave a powerful framework for various other code constructions, but it remained unfulfilled for RM codes. In this paper, we settle the establishment of a polarization theory for RM codes, which implies in particular that RM codes have a vanishing local error below capacity. Our proof puts forward a striking connection with the recent proof of the Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture [40] and an entropy extraction approach related to [2]. It further puts forward a small orbit localization lemma of potential broader applicability in combinatorial number theory. Finally, a new additive combinatorics conjecture is put forward, with potentially broader applications to coding theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 75 pages, 45 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper explores the cluster algebra structure of the moduli space $\mathscr{A}_{\mathrm{SL}_{n+1},\mathbb{S}}$ of twisted $\mathrm{SL}_{n+1}$-local systems on a surface. We derive general recurrence relations for cluster variables arising from flips of a triangulation, corresponding to specific sequences of mutations. Our approach is grounded in a detailed combinatorial analysis over the standard $n$-triangulated $m$-gon (with explicit calculations for $n=1,2$). As a generalization, the non-simply-laced $G_2$ type is also considered. We prove the "well-triangulated" property for cluster mutations under flips, which provides a combinatorial framework for understanding the stability and transformation rules of these cluster algebra structures, and compute the monomial counts for the cluster expansion formula.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a q-deformation of the p-adic regulator of a number field, called the cyclosyntomic regulator, building on the Habiro ring of Garoufalidis-Scholze-Wheeler-Zagier. The key new ingredient in our construction is a refinement of Sulyma's norm maps in prismatic cohomology, which interpolate between classical powers and Frobenius maps at various prime numbers p. Furthermore, we compute the values of the cyclosyntomic regulator at units of the form $1-ζ$, where $ζ$ is a root of unity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that a perverse sheaf on a connected commutatitve algebraic group over a finite is generically unramified. This implies an equidistribution theorem for Tannakian monodromy groups in previously unavailable generality. We also prove a stratification theorem for exponential sums in families indexed by a scheme and the characters of a connected commutative algebraic group. Our method is based on Tannakian categories introduced by Gabber and Loeser. This method naturally yields fiber functors. We also prove vanishing theorems over a connected commutative algebraic group, classify the negligible sheaves, and prove relative weak propagation theorems for tori.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages, 2 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we show that a certain subset of the Carmichael numbers contains good Euler pseudoprimes, composite numbers that for many bases survive the Solovay-Strassen primality test. We present a classification of Carmichael numbers, and use the knowledge gained from this to create a fast algorithm to compute new Euler pseudoprimes, by multiplying already found Euler pseudoprimes. We use this algorithm to find many Euler pseudoprimes that are pseudoprimes for several consecutive prime bases starting at 2, hence for all integer bases up to that number. The best Euler pseudoprime we find survives up to 211, i.e., survives the first 47 prime bases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $D(G)$ be the algebra of algebraic differential operators on a complex reductive group $G$. Denote by $\mathbb{W}$ the bi-Whittaker quantum Hamiltonian reduction of $D(G)$, also known as the quantum Toda lattice. In this article we define the admissible $\mathbb{W}$-modules and the special case of Harish-Chandra modules, the latter being bi-Whittaker variants of the invariant holonomic systems of Hotta-Kashiwara. We then study their torsion properties up to completion relative to the Kazhdan filtration, which in general is unbounded in both directions, through the geometry of universal centralizer. In the case of regular infinitesimal characters, the corresponding $D(G)$-module is shown to be the minimal extension of an irregular connection on the open Bruhat cell. Certain ring-theoretic properties of the completion of $\mathbb{W}$ are also obtained.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a prime-weighted oscillatory model inspired by structural aspects of the Euler product of the Riemann zeta function. The model defines finite superpositions of prime-frequency modes and exhibits zero-like crossings produced by destructive interference. We analyze how the weight exponent $x$ controls amplitude growth, slope scaling, and stability of crossings. A heuristic asymptotic argument identifies $x=\tfrac12$ as a distinguished balance regime separating high-energy and over-damped behavior. The results concern the defined model itself.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By defining projective error models we study the mathematical structure of Clifford codes and stabilizer codes using tools from projective representation theory. Furthermore, we introduce a new class of codes which we have called weak stabilizer codes and we determine some relationships between these three classes of codes. We show that the obstruction for a stabilizer code to be non-trivial is given by a class in group cohomology, and we are able to determine similar obstructions for weak stabilizer codes to be non-trivial. In the case where the projective error model corresponds to a nice error basis we give a complete characterization of when a Clifford code is a weak stabilizer code in terms of the size of the group of logical operators and the size of the group of stabilizers of the code. Lastly, we produce two infinite families of Clifford codes that are not stabilizer codes, as well as a method of combining these examples into more examples of non-stabilizer Clifford codes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G \leq \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ be a non-trivial finite group, acting on $R = \mathbb{C}[x_1, x_2, x_3]$. We continue our investigation from arXiv:2505.10683 [math.RT] into when the resulting skew-group algebra $R \ast G$ is a $3$-preprojective algebra of a $2$-representation infinite algebra, defined by a so-called cut. We consider the subgroups arising from $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{C}) \hookrightarrow \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$, called type (B), as well as the exceptional subgroups, called types (E) -- (L). For groups of type (B), we show that a $3$-preprojective cut exists on $R \ast G$ if and only if $G$ is not isomorphic to a subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ or $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$. For groups $G$ of the remaining types (E) -- (L), every $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective cut, except for type (H) and (I). To prove our results for type (B), we explore how the notion of isoclinism interacts with the shape of McKay quivers. We compute the McKay quivers in detail, using a knitting-style heuristic. For the exceptional subgroups, we compute the McKay quivers directly, as well as cuts, and we discuss how this task can be done algorithmically. This provides many new examples of $2$-representation infinite algebras, and together with arXiv:2401.10720 [math.RT], arXiv:2505.10683 [math.RT] completes the classification of finite subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ for which $R \ast G$ is a $3$-preprojective algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G \leq \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ be a non-trivial finite group, acting on $R = \mathbb{C}[x_1, x_2, x_3]$. The resulting skew-group algebra $R \ast G$ is $3$-Calabi-Yau, and can sometimes be endowed with the structure of a $3$-preprojective algebra. However, not every such $R \ast G$ admits such a structure. The finite subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ are classified into types (A) to (L). We consider the groups $G$ of types (C) and (D) and determine for each such group whether the algebra $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective cut, that is a $3$-preprojective structure arising from a grading of the McKay quiver of $G$. We show that the algebra $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective cut if and only if $9 \mid |G|$. Our proof is constructive and yields a description of the involved $2$-representation infinite algebras. This is based on the semi-direct decomposition $G \simeq N \rtimes K$ for an abelian group $N$, and we show that the existence of a $3$-preprojective structure on $R \ast G$ is essentially determined by the existence of one on $R \ast N$. This provides new classes of $2$-representation infinite algebras, and we discuss some $2$-Auslander-Platzeck-Reiten tilts. Along the way, we give a detailed description of the involved groups and their McKay quivers by iteratively applying skew-group constructions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(X, d)$ be a compact metric space, and let $Q \subset X$ be countable. Given functions $R: Q \to \mathbb{R}^+$ and $φ: \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathbb{R}^+$, we consider the set $E(Q, R, φ)$ of points $x \in X$ that ``hit'' the shrinking balls $B(ξ,{φ(R(ξ))})$ for infinitely many $ξ\in Q$, yet, for every $ε\in (0,1)$, are eventually ``cleared out'' from the slightly smaller neighborhoods $B(ξ,{(1-ε)φ(R(ξ))})$, that is, they lie outside all but finitely many of these smaller balls. We give sufficient conditions (also necessary under mild assumptions) for $E(Q, R, φ)$ to have infinite Hausdorff $f$-measure. This setting generalizes both the classical set $\mathrm{Exact}(ψ)$ of exactly $ψ$-approximable points (with $ψ$ non-increasing) and certain types of restricted Diophantine approximation sets.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This version corrects an issue in the definition of the bottleneck distance pointed out by Luis Scoccola. The notion of matching has been refined so that it incorporates information from the differentials in minimal projective resolutions

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a stability theory for minimal projective resolutions of $\mathbf{P}$-modules, where $\mathbf{P}$ is a finite metric poset. On the module side, we introduce the Galois transport distance, defined by factoring two modules through a common "apex" poset via pairs of Galois insertions and measuring the maximal displacement in the index poset. This construction generalizes the interleaving distance in both the classical one-parameter and multiparameter settings, and yields an extended metric on isomorphism classes of $\mathbf{P}$-modules. On the homological side, we define a bottleneck distance between minimal projective resolutions by matching indecomposable projectives degreewise, with contractible cones playing the role of diagonal terms. Our main theorem shows that this resolution-level bottleneck distance is always bounded above by the Galois transport distance, providing a metric stability result formulated entirely at the level of modules and their minimal projective resolutions. We then treat persistence as an application. Passing to the interval poset and a kernel construction, we interpret persistence diagrams as minimal projective resolutions of kernel modules and obtain a corresponding stability inequality. In the one-parameter case this recovers classical bottleneck stability, while in the multiparameter setting it extends naturally to signed diagrams arising from minimal projective resolutions. Via a general relationship between minimal projective resolutions and Möbius inversion, these results can be interpreted as a stability theorem for Möbius homology, while remaining entirely phrased in the language of projective resolutions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine all groups which occur as torsion subgroups of $\mathbb Q$-curves defined over number fields of degrees $3$, $5$ and $7$. In particular, we prove that every torsion subgroup of a $\mathbb Q$-curve defined over a number field of degree $3,5$ or $7$ already occurs as a torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve with rational $j$-invariant. As the quadratic case has been solved by Le Fourn and Najman, and the case of extensions of prime degree greater than $7$ has been solved by Cremona and Najman, this paper completes the classification of torsion of $\mathbb Q$-curves over number fields of prime degree. We also establish that the torsion subgroup an elliptic curve over a number field $K$ of prime degree which is isogenous to an elliptic curve with rational $j$-invariant is equal to the torsion subgroup of some elliptic curve defined over a degree $p$ number field with rational $j$-invariant.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a set with $M$ elements, let $ψ:\mathcal{M}\to\mathcal{M}$ be a bijective involution, and let~$\boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}_ψ$ be the set of sequences $(x_1,\dots,x_M)\in\mathcal{M}^M$ with the property that $x_{M+1-j} = ψ(x_j)$ for $1\le j\le M$. This framework can be used to infer the possible distribution of sequences, such as the modular ones, that pose challenges for conventional methods. We prove that when $M$ is even, there exists a limit probability density function that weighs the parameter $k$ that counts the appearances of the elements of $\mathcal{M}$ among the terms of sequences $\textbf{x}\in\boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}_ψ$. It turns out that the number of fixed points of $ψ$ influences the probability density function, which decomposes into two pieces, each multiplied by complementary factors, and the smaller of the two pieces appears only when $k$ is even. Applying the model, we find a threshold from which almost all sequences contain related terms with prescribed frequencies.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we explore a natural extension of the quadratic parametrization introduced in our previous work. By replacing the integer $n$ by $n^s$ ($ s\in\mathbb{R}, s>1$) and allowing the parameters to be real, we obtain for each $n\ge 1$ a decomposition $\frac{k}{n^s} = \frac{1}{x_s(n)}+\frac{1}{y_s(n)}+\frac{1}{z_s(n)}$ with $x_s(n), y_s(n), z_s(n) \in \mathbb{R}^*+$. Summing this equality over all integers brings forth the Riemann zeta function. Subject to an analytic continuation of the quantities $x_s(n), y_s(n), z_s(n)$ to complex values of $s$, one would obtain a new function \(G_k(s)\) satisfying $G_k(s)=k\,ζ(s)$, thus establishing a deep connection between the structure of the conjecture and the zeros of $ζ$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime and let $L$ be a quadratic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-lattice with quadratic form $Q$. For $t\neq 0$ the local representation density $α_p(t;L)$ is the stable normalised growth of the congruence counts of solutions to $Q(v)\equiv t\pmod{p^m}$. We compute these counts and densities explicitly for the hyperbolic plane $H_0$ over $\mathbb{Z}p$, uniformly in $p$, and at $p=2$ for the basic dyadic blocks (rank-$1$ Type I blocks and the even binary planes $2^aH\varepsilon$), together with the anisotropic ternary lattice $L_3=\langle 2\rangle^{\oplus 3}$. At the dyadic prime the usual Jacobian/Hensel lifting mechanism breaks down in the bilinear-lattice convention $Q(v)=\langle v,v\rangle$. The main new input is an explicit half-lift involution for diagonal sums of squares, which yields a stable lifting recursion with factor $2^{d-1}$ under the primitivity hypothesis $4\nmid a$. As applications we obtain closed forms for the three-squares congruence counts (hence $α_2(t;L_3)$) and a prime-uniform formula for the densities of the scaled hyperbolic planes $p^eH_0$ in the standard normalisation $q=\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle/2$.</p></details>

We treat examples related to Fukaya categories and representation theory. In a related direction, we define the monodromy of a perverse schober parametrized by a ribbon graph on a framed surface and show that it forms a local system of stable $\infty$-categories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a finite group $Γ$, we prove results on the distribution of the prime to $q|Γ|$-part of fundamental groups of $Γ$-covers of the projective line $\mathbb P^1_{\mathbb F_q}$ over a finite field $\mathbb F_q$ as $q\to\infty$. Equivalently, this is a result on the distribution of the Galois groups of maximal unramified extension of $Γ$-extensions of $\mathbb F_q(t)$, and thereby motivates a new conjecture on the distribution of Galois groups of maximal unramified extension of $Γ$-extensions of a number field. In particular, this allows us to see and predict the effect of roots of unity in the base field on such distributions. We introduce the idea to study these groups along with the class in their 3rd homology group that arises from Artin-Verdier duality. This invariant refines the lifting invariant that, in the function field setting, corresponds to stable components of Hurwitz space. One major input into our function field results is an application of our recently developed methods to determine a distribution of groups (or more general algebraic structures) from its moments. We prove non-existence results in the number field case that support our conjectures in the case where our conjectures predict certain kinds of groups occur with probability zero.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f$ be a Rademacher or Steinhaus random multiplicative function. For various arithmetically interesting subsets $\mathcal A\subseteq [1, N]\cap\mathbb N$ such that the distribution of $\sum_{n\in \mathcal A} f(n)$ is approximately Gaussian, we develop a general framework to understand the large fluctuations of the sum. This extends the general central limit theorem framework of Soundararajan and Xu. In the case when $\mathcal A = (N-H, N]$ is a short interval with admissible $H=H(N)$, we show that almost surely \begin{equation*} \limsup_{N\to\infty} \frac{\big\lvert\sum_{N-H<n\leq N} f(n)\big\rvert}{\sqrt{H\log \frac{N}H{}}}>0. \end{equation*} When $\mathcal A$ is the set of values of an admissible polynomial $P\in\mathbb Z[x]$, we extend work of Klurman, Shkredov, and Xu, as well as Chinis and the author, showing that almost surely \begin{equation*} \limsup_{N\to\infty} \frac{\big\lvert\sum_{n\leq N} f(P(n))\big\rvert}{\sqrt{N \log\log N}}>0, \end{equation*} even when $P$ is a product of linear factors over $\mathbb Q$. In this case, we also establish the corresponding almost sure upper bound, matching the law of iterated logarithm. An important ingredient in our work is bounding the Kantorovich--Wasserstein distance by means of a quantitative martingale central limit theorem.</p></details>

Our proof refines Zywina's work to give a (conditional) parameterization of the images of adelic Galois representations of elliptic curves. In particular, we show that there are 41 $j$-invariants of elliptic curves whose associated Galois image does not vary in an infinite family. Using our explicit parameterization, we show that all rational points on all modular curves arise from the geometry of modular curves in a formal sense, confirming a philosophy of Mazur and Ogg.</p></details>

We show that all nonzero shifts of proper multiplicative subgroups (of size at least $3$) are not ratio sets of the form $A/A$. This in particular extends a result of Shkredov, where he showed the same for small multiplicative subgroups (of size $<p^{6/7}$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$).

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>With an eye to applications to type A and Schur-Weyl duality, we study Kazhdan-Lusztig bases for a general parabolic Hecke algebra. Parabolic Hecke algebras are idempotent subalgebras of Hecke algebras corresponding to parabolic subgroups, and for type A they coincide with the fused Hecke algebras appearing in a generalisation of the Schur-Weyl duality with the quantum group of GL(N). In this paper we investigate two different Kazhdan-Lusztig bases for parabolic Hecke algebras, together with the associated cells and the corresponding representations. We quickly specialise to type A, for which we describe the cells in terms of the RSK correspondence generalising thus the well-known description for the symmetric group. As a first application we recover the classification of irreducible representations of parabolic Hecke algebras of type A and provide a new construction of these representations. Next we turn to the Schur-Weyl duality and describe the kernel in terms of one the basis studied precedently. Moreover, we formulate some conjectures about a generator of these kernels in terms of Kazhdan-Lusztig basis elements, give some evidence and prove these conjectures in some special cases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish an analog of a theorem of Stallings which asserts the homomorphisms between the universal nilpotent quotients induced by a homomorphism $G \to H$ of groups are isomorphisms provided a pair of homological conditions are satisfied. Our analogy does not have a homomorphism between $G$ and $H$ but instead $G,H \leq G_0$ that satisfies a similar homological condition. We derive a few applications of this result. First, we show that there exist pairs of non-isomorphic number fields whose absolute Galois groups have isomorphic universal nilpotent quotients. We show that there exists pairs of non-isometric hyperbolic $n$-manifolds whose fundamental groups are residually nilpotent and have isomorphic universal nilpotent quotients. These are the first examples of residually nilpotent Kleinian groups with arbitrarily large nilpotent genus. Complex hyperbolic 2-manifold examples are given as well. Considering Riemann surfaces and complex hyperbolic 2-manifolds as projective curves and surfaces defined over a number field, we show the (outer) action of the absolute Galois group of the field of definition on the universal nilpotent quotients of the geometric fundamental groups are equivalent. This is in contrast to fact that the (outer) Galois action on the geometric fundamental group of a projective hyperbolic curve determines the curve by work of Mochizuki. In particular, the nilpotent representation theory of the geometric fundamental group is not anabelian.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate integers whose base $g$ expansion omits a fixed digit and which can be represented as a sum of two prime squares.

In the second part, combining the circle method with sieve methods, we study the second moment of the corresponding unweighted counting function. This allows us to get a nontrivial lower bound for the cardinality of the set $$\{ n \leq g^k : n \text{ omits the digit } b \text{ in its base } g \text{ expansion and } n = p^2 + q^2 \text{ for some primes } p,q \}. $$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide new local characterizations of Hida families of Siegel modular forms with genus two arising from automorphic inductions (stable Yoshida lifts), analogous to the characterizations of Hida families of CM modular forms provided by Ghate--Vatsal. Our characterizations involve (i) density of de Rham at $p$ specializations at the singular weights $(k,2)$ and (ii) local decomposability at $p$ of the associated $Λ$-adic Galois representation. Our approach is similar to that of Castella--Wang-Erickson who provided an alternate strategy to reproving the main results of Ghate--Vatsal by applying Ribet's method when an anti-cyclotomic class group is assumed to be pseudo-null and cyclic as a $Λ$-module. Along these lines, one key input to our methods involves an assumption of pseudo-nullity of Selmer groups that are defined by imposing stricter conditions at $p$ than those imposed for the usual Greenberg Selmer groups appearing in the Asai main conjectures over real quadratic fields. Following Genestier--Tilouine and Pilloni, we also prove a minimal $R=\mathbb{T}$ theorem that is essential to establishing our results at various stages.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study existential theories of henselian valued fields of positive characteristic with parameters from a trivially valued subfield. Compared to previous work, we relax perfectness and separability assumptions, and instead work with the weaker algebraic hypothesis of formal smoothness over the parameter field, which we discuss in detail in our setting. Assuming a weak consequence of resolution of singularities, which was already used in previous work, we obtain an axiomatisation of the existential theory of such a valued field in terms of the existential theory of the residue field, both over the same parameter field. This result has natural applications to asymptotic theories of completions of function fields of curves. We work these out in detail for the case of function fields over fairly general pseudo-algebraically closed fields, where we obtain decidability of the sets of universal/existential sentences holding in all completions or all but finitely many completions, respectively.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We explain how to obtain the set of solutions of a multivariate polynomial equation modulo a power of a prime number. These solutions are determined by a tree, called the trunk, which makes it possible to reconstruct all solutions. We apply these methods to determine the number of solutions, without having to enumerate them. We also illustrate these techniques by proving a simple case of Igusa's theorem: the Poincaré series associated with a polynomial in two separated variables is rational.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a class of blocks which is called hyperfocal abelian Frobenius blocks.This class of blocks is an analogous version of the block with abelian defect group and Frobenius inertial quotient at hyperfocal level and includes the blocks with Klein four hyperfocal subgroups and cyclic hyperfocal subgroups. We show that there is a stable equivalence of Morita type between the hyperfocal subalgebras of the hyperfocal abelian Frobenius blocks and a group algebra of a Frobenius group associated with the hyperfocal subgroup of the block. As applications, we can partially describe some structures of the blocks with Klein four hyperfocal subgroups and cyclic hyperfocal subgroups,such as the structures of their hyperfocal subalgebras in terms of derived categories and the structures of their characters. As a consequence, we show that Broue's abelian defect group conjecture holds for blocks with Klein four hyperfocal subgroups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we present a method based on contour integration to investigate a class of cyclotomic parametric Apéry-like series. The general term of such series involves a parametric central binomial coefficient, which is defined via the Gamma function. Using this approach, we express a family of cyclotomic Apéry-like series in terms of multiple polylogarithms, cyclotomic Hurwitz zeta values, Riemann zeta values and $\log(2)$. In particular, we provide several illustrative examples and corollaries, which enable us to recover a number of known results on Apéry-like series. At the same time, we have also left open two questions regarding Apéry-like series. Moreover, by considering integrals of the generating function for Fuss-Catalan numbers, we derive an alternative expression for a classical Apéry-like series. Combining this with known results allows us to establish several identities for multiple polylogarithm functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper applies the modular approach to obtain effectively computable bounds for Fermat-type equations over number fields, while also discussing the differences and obstructions that arise when considering such equations over totally real versus totally complex number fields. We use these techniques to study the generalized Fermat equation $d^ra^p+b^p+c^p=0$ over quadratic fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ of class number one. Extending the results of Freitas\&Siksek and Turcas, we show that when $d=-3,-11,3,5,7,11,13,19,23$, there is an effective and explicit bound, depending on the field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$, such that the latter equation does not have certain types of special solutions. In addition, we obtain effective bounds for $d=-19,-43$, showing that the same equation has no non-trivial solutions of this type. We also discuss, for $d=6,14,21$, the solutions of a variant of the above equation. Our results over imaginary quadratic fields are conjectural. Serre's modularity conjecture and an analogue of Eichler-Shimura over totally complex fields are assumed.</p></details>

When $g(X_H)\geq 2$ this is equivalent to determining all the hyperelliptic modular curves of prime-power level and all the bielliptic modular curves of prime-power level that admit a degree two map to a positive rank elliptic curve. From the moduli perspective, this means that there are exactly 1085 subgroups $H$ of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\widehat{\mathbb{Z}})$ of prime-power level for which there are infinitely many elliptic curves $E/K$ over quadratic extensions such that $ρ_E(G_k)$ is conjugate to a subgroup of $H$.</p></details>

For instance, we interpret the Gerasimov-Kharchev-Lebedev-Oblezin homomorphism into the algebra of difference operators via a finite analog of the Miura transform. This algebraic identification is deduced by relating degenerate affine Hecke algebras to the simplest example of a rational Feigin-Odesskii shuffle product. As a bonus, we obtain a presentation of the latter via a mirabolic version of the Kostant-Whittaker reduction.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For every prime $p \geq 5$, we compute the $p$-th power of the Ramanujan vector field that arises from the differential relations discovered by Ramanujan for the Eisenstein series $E_2,E_4$ and $E_6$. Our method results in explicit equations for the $p$-th power and uses classical results of Serre and Swinnerton-Dyer about modular forms modulo $p$. From this, we verify that a general conjecture by Sheperd-Barron and Ekedahl is valid for the Ramanujan vector field. Furthermore, we consider the affine realization of a certain moduli space of elliptic curves where the Ramanujan vector field is defined, and describe - in characteristic $p$ - the locus given by supersingular elliptic curves in two ways: a classical one - using equations for the supersingular polynomial - and a new one as the singular set of some vector fields. Additionally, we prove that the Ramanujan vector field is transversal to this locus.</p></details>

As a special case of our result, we strengthen the results obtained by Pieropan and Schindler on Campana points of bounded height on toric varieties. As another special case, we obtain an asymptotic for the number of weak Campana points of bounded height, which is novel even for projective space. We illustrate this result by giving an asymptotic for the number of points on projective space of bounded height for which the product of coordinates is powerful. Finally, we derive an asymptotic for the number of rational points in the image of a toric rational map, in the spirit of the Loughran-Smeets conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article develops a parametric approach to study the Diophantine equation \(\frac{k}{n} = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z}\), underlying the Erdős--Straus (\(k=4\)), Sierpiński (\(k=5\)), and their generalizations. We introduce and analyze the fundamental function \(F_{x,t}^{(k)}(n) = t^2(kx-n)^2 - 2nxt\), whose perfect square values are equivalent to solutions of the conjectures. For any fixed pair \((x,t)\), we define its admissible domain \(\mathcal{D}_{x,t}^{(k)}\) and prove that on this domain, \(F\) is strictly decreasing, non-negative, and converges to its minimum. A key result is the Zero Lemma: if \(F(n_0)=0\) for some \(n_0\) in the domain, then \(n_0\) is necessarily the upper bound of \(\mathcal{D}_{x,t}^{(k)}\), and such zeros of \(F\) yield explicit symmetric solutions with \(y=z\). As an illustration, in the classical Erdős--Straus case (\(k=4\)), we explicitly construct symmetric solutions \(y = z\) for all integers \(n \equiv 0,2,3 \pmod{4}\), covering already \(75\%\) of all integers. For the remaining class \(n \equiv 1 \pmod{4}\), which is traditionally more challenging, we construct explicit symmetric solutions based on the existence of a divisor \(b \equiv 3 \pmod{4}\), and we show that this condition is satisfied for almost all such integers: the set of exceptions has natural density zero. Consequently, the Erdős--Straus conjecture is verified for a proportion of integers tending to \(1\) in this class. In particular, we obtain infinitely many new explicit families of symmetric solutions for numbers not covered by Mordell's theorem. These results elucidate the structural behavior of \(F\) and provide a unified framework for generating large families of solutions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we establish two main results concerning the Mumford-Tate conjecture for hyper-Kähler varieties. First, we prove the conjecture for the semisimplified $\ell$-adic Galois representations attached to hyper-Kähler varieties with second Betti number $b_2 \geq 4$. As a direct consequence, we deduce that the Hodge conjecture implies the Tate conjecture for powers of hyper-Kähler varieties. Second, we show that the Mumford-Tate conjecture for hyper-Kähler varieties is invariant under deformation. The proofs rely on comparing the ranks of $\ell$-adic algebraic monodromy groups in higher degrees to those in degree $2$ via the theory of Frobenius tori and the Looijenga-Lunts-Verbitsky Lie algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article we study the endomorphism algebras of abelian varieties $A$ defined over a given number field $K$ with large cyclic 2-torsion fields. A key step in doing so is to provide criteria for all the endomorphisms of $A$ to be defined over $K(A[2])$, the field generated by its 2-torsion. When $K= \mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(A[2])/\mathbb{Q})$ is cyclic of prime order $p = 2 \dim(A) +1$, we prove that there are only finitely many possibilities for the geometric endomorphism algebra $\mathrm{End}(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$.In fact, when $\dim (A) \not \in \{3,5,9,21,33,81\}$, we show $\mathrm{End}(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ is a proper subfield of the $p$-th cyclotomic field. In particular, when $g=2$, $\mathrm{End}(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to either $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We exhibit examples of geometrically simple abelian surfaces $A/\mathbb{Q}$ with conductor bounded by $(10\,000)^2$ whose Tate--Shafarevich groups contain a subgroup isomorphic to $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^2$ for each $p = 5, 7, 11, 13$. To find these examples we generalise work of Cremona--Freitas to enumerate all congruences of a certain type between pairs of weight $2$ newforms $f \in S_2^{\mathrm{new}}(Γ_0(N))$ and $g \in S_2^{\mathrm{new}}(Γ_0(M))$ contained in the LMFDB (i.e., with $N, M < 10\,000$) and with coefficient fields of degree $\leq 4$. Passing from the modular forms to the corresponding abelian varieties we use visibility to (unconditionally) prove the existence of non-trivial elements of the Tate--Shafarevich group. Finally we construct an example of an abelian surface with $(\mathbb{Z}/7\mathbb{Z})^2 \subset \mathrm{Sha}(A/\mathbb{Q})$ which is (conjecturally) not visible in any abelian threefold.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a unital associative PI-algebra over a field of characteristic zero. We study which partitions $λ$ appear with nonzero multiplicities in the cocharacter sequence of $A$ for several classes of algebras $A$. Berele defines the eventual arm width $ω_0(A)$ to be the maximal integer $d$ so that if $λ$ appears with nonzero multiplicity in the cocharacter sequence of $A$, then $λ$ can have at most $d$ parts arbitrarily large. Berele also shows that if $A$ is Lie nilpotent, then $ω_0(A) = 1$. In the first part of this paper, we show that if $A$ is unital, then $ω_0(A) = 1$ if and only if $A$ is Lie nilpotent. To prove this statement, we show that the algebra of proper polynomials $B_n(A)$ is finite dimensional if and only if $A$ is Lie nilpotent. In the second part, we give a bound on the nonzero multiplicities $λ$ in the cocharacter sequence of $A$, when the T-ideal of identities of $A$ is equal to a product of T-ideals generated by long commutators. As an application, we show that for a Lie nilpotent algebra $A$, the nonzero multiplicities $m_λ(A)$ correspond to partitions $λ$ which are supported in step-like diagrams in which the number of steps grows with the index of Lie nilpotency. Finally, we give also some applications to the noncommutative invariant theory of the special linear group $\mathrm{SL}(n)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathscr{X}_0(N)$ be the Deligne--Rapoport modular stack of elliptic curves endowed with a cyclic rational $N$-isogeny over a number field $F$. Let $N\in\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,16,18,25\},$ which are precisely the values for which the coarse moduli space of $\mathscr{X}_0(N)$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1$. We show that the stacky Batyrev--Manin conjecture [DY24] holds for the naive height on $\mathscr{X}_0(N)$ when $F=\mathbb{Q}$. In the process, we give a concrete description of $\mathscr{X}_0(N)$ as a square root stack over a stacky curve.</p></details>
