### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20109v1'>2602.20109</a>\]&nbsp; **On the Ramanujan Vector Field modulo $p$**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Frederico Bianchini &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For every prime $p \geq 5$, we compute the $p$-th power of the Ramanujan vector field that arises from the differential relations discovered by Ramanujan for the Eisenstein series $E_2,E_4$ and $E_6$. Our method results in explicit equations for the $p$-th power and uses classical results of Serre and Swinnerton-Dyer about modular forms modulo $p$. From this, we verify that a general conjecture by Sheperd-Barron and Ekedahl is valid for the Ramanujan vector field. Furthermore, we consider the affine realization of a certain moduli space of elliptic curves where the Ramanujan vector field is defined, and describe - in characteristic $p$ - the locus given by supersingular elliptic curves in two ways: a classical one - using equations for the supersingular polynomial - and a new one as the singular set of some vector fields. Additionally, we prove that the Ramanujan vector field is transversal to this locus.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ denote a number field and let $\mathfrak{q}\subset O_F$ traverse a sequence of prime ideals with norm $N(\mathfrak{q}) \to \infty$ and for each $\mathfrak{q}$, let $χ\in \widehat{F^{\times}\setminus \mathbb{A}^\times}$ be a finite order character of conductor $\mathfrak{q}$. For a fixed unitary cuspidal automorphic representation $π$ of $\mathrm{GL}_3/F$ we show that \begin{equation*} L(π\otimes χ,\tfrac{1}{2})\ll \ N(\mathfrak{q})^{3/4-κ}.\end{equation*} holds for all $κ< \frac{1}{36}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this short note we show that every connected reductive simply-connected algebraic group of rank $>1$ over the complex numbers has infinitely many pairs of irreducible representations which are not related by an automorphism of the algebraic group and which have the same degree. This answers a question I was asked by J.~P.~Serre.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Besfort Shala &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 30 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f$ be a Rademacher or Steinhaus random multiplicative function. For various arithmetically interesting subsets $\mathcal A\subseteq [1, N]\cap\mathbb N$ such that the distribution of $\sum_{n\in \mathcal A} f(n)$ is approximately Gaussian, we develop a general framework to understand the large fluctuations of the sum. This extends the general central limit theorem framework of Soundararajan and Xu. In the case when $\mathcal A = (N-H, N]$ is a short interval with admissible $H=H(N)$, we show that almost surely \begin{equation*} \limsup_{N\to\infty} \frac{\big\lvert\sum_{N-H<n\leq N} f(n)\big\rvert}{\sqrt{H\log \frac{N}H{}}}>0. \end{equation*} When $\mathcal A$ is the set of values of an admissible polynomial $P\in\mathbb Z[x]$, we extend work of Klurman, Shkredov, and Xu, as well as Chinis and the author, showing that almost surely \begin{equation*} \limsup_{N\to\infty} \frac{\big\lvert\sum_{n\leq N} f(P(n))\big\rvert}{\sqrt{N \log\log N}}>0, \end{equation*} even when $P$ is a product of linear factors over $\mathbb Q$. In this case, we also establish the corresponding almost sure upper bound, matching the law of iterated logarithm. An important ingredient in our work is bounding the Kantorovich--Wasserstein distance by means of a quantitative martingale central limit theorem.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** D. Kaledin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 602 pages, LaTeX2e. Relatively minor changes: fixed some typos and a couple of small mistakes in the proofs, added a section to the Introduction explaining relation to previous work on derivators and to derivator K-theory. Introduction and Chapters 1-5 are now in their final form, to be published in Proc. Steklov Inst., while Chapters 6 and 7 are still preliminary. Comments are very welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop foundations for abstract homotopy theory based on Grothendieck's idea of a "derivator". The theory is model-independent, and does not depend on model categories, nor on simplicial sets. It is designed to accomodate all the usual potential applications, such as e.g. enhancements for derived categories of coherent sheaves, in a way that is as close as possible to usual category theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 42 pages, added Corollary 1.6 and connections to the Loughran-Smeets conjecture

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish an asymptotic formula for the number of $\mathcal{M}$-points of bounded height on split toric varieties, for the height induced by any big and nef divisor class. This formula establishes new cases of the extension of Manin's conjecture to $\mathcal{M}$-points, as introduced by the author. As a special case of our result, we strengthen the results obtained by Pieropan and Schindler on Campana points of bounded height on toric varieties. As another special case, we obtain an asymptotic for the number of weak Campana points of bounded height, which is novel even for projective space. We illustrate this result by giving an asymptotic for the number of points on projective space of bounded height for which the product of coordinates is powerful. Finally, we derive an asymptotic for the number of rational points in the image of a toric rational map, in the spirit of the Loughran-Smeets conjecture.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 47 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We initiate a general quantitative study of sets of $\mathcal{M}$-points, which are special subsets of rational points, generalizing Campana points, Darmon points, and squarefree solutions of Diophantine equations. We propose an asymptotic formula for the number of $\mathcal{M}$-points of bounded height on rationally connected varieties, extending Manin's conjecture as well as its generalization to Campana points by Pieropan, Smeets, Tanimoto and Várilly-Alvarado. Finally, we show that the conjecture explains several previously established results in arithmetic statistics.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 10 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For all $k\geq 2$, we provide almost-sharp quantitative results for the $k$-dimensional Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture, analogous to recent developments in the 1-D case of Koukoulopoulos-Maynard-Yang. In particular, for $ψ:\mathbb{N}\to[0,1/2]$ such that $\sum_{q\in \mathbb{N}}(ψ(q)\varphi(q)/q)^k$ diverges, $Q\geq 1$ and $α\in\mathbb{R}$, we denote by $S_k(α, Q)$ the number of pairs $(a,q)\in\mathbb{Z}^k\times \mathbb{N}$ with $q\leq Q$, $\gcd(a_i,q)=1$ for each $i\in\{1,\dots,k\}$, satisfying $\|qα-a\|_{\infty}<ψ(q)$. Defining $Ψ_k(Q)=\sum_{q\leq Q}(2ψ(q)\varphi(q)/q)^k$, we show that for all $\varepsilon>0$ and almost all $α$ one has $S_k(α,Q)=Ψ_k(Q)+O_{\varepsilon,k}(Ψ(Q)^{1/2+\varepsilon})$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Matt Broe &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 46 pages. Extended some results on cubic threefolds to cubic fivefolds. Section 3 significantly expanded. Added explicit criterion for existence of Lefschetz pencils in section 5. Minor updates to exposition and typo fixes throughout. All results of previous versions are preserved in their original form. Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Beilinson--Bloch conjecture is a generalization of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, which relates the ranks of Chow groups of smooth projective varieties over global fields to the order of vanishing of $L$-functions. We prove the conjecture for certain classes of non-isotrivial varieties over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$, including some cubic threefolds and fivefolds. We deduce the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for their intermediate Jacobians, and use it to establish new cases of the Tate conjecture over finite fields. We also prove further results on the arithmetic of these intermediate Jacobians. To that end, we show that a few classes of varieties over an arbitrary field have motive of abelian type, generalizing previously known examples over the complex numbers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** To appear in Integers 2026

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the variation in the total number of points in a random $p\times p$ square in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ where the $p$-adic valuation of a given polynomial in two variables is precisely $1$. We establish that this quantity follows a Poisson distribution as $p\rightarrow\infty$ under a certain conjecture. We also relate this conjecture to certain uniform distribution properties of a vector valued sequence.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Philemon Urbain Mballa &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article develops a parametric approach to study the Diophantine equation \(\frac{k}{n} = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z}\), underlying the Erdős--Straus (\(k=4\)), Sierpiński (\(k=5\)), and their generalizations. We introduce and analyze the fundamental function \(F_{x,t}^{(k)}(n) = t^2(kx-n)^2 - 2nxt\), whose perfect square values are equivalent to solutions of the conjectures. For any fixed pair \((x,t)\), we define its admissible domain \(\mathcal{D}_{x,t}^{(k)}\) and prove that on this domain, \(F\) is strictly decreasing, non-negative, and converges to its minimum. A key result is the Zero Lemma: if \(F(n_0)=0\) for some \(n_0\) in the domain, then \(n_0\) is necessarily the upper bound of \(\mathcal{D}_{x,t}^{(k)}\), and such zeros of \(F\) yield explicit symmetric solutions with \(y=z\). As an illustration, in the classical Erdős--Straus case (\(k=4\)), we explicitly construct symmetric solutions \(y = z\) for all integers \(n \equiv 0,2,3 \pmod{4}\), covering already \(75\%\) of all integers. For the remaining class \(n \equiv 1 \pmod{4}\), which is traditionally more challenging, we construct explicit symmetric solutions based on the existence of a divisor \(b \equiv 3 \pmod{4}\), and we show that this condition is satisfied for almost all such integers: the set of exceptions has natural density zero. Consequently, the Erdős--Straus conjecture is verified for a proportion of integers tending to \(1\) in this class. In particular, we obtain infinitely many new explicit families of symmetric solutions for numbers not covered by Mordell's theorem. These results elucidate the structural behavior of \(F\) and provide a unified framework for generating large families of solutions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime number. We compute the trivial source character tables of finite Frobenius groups $G$ with an abelian Frobenius complement $H$ and an elementary abelian Frobenius kernel of order $p^2$. More precisely, we deal with all infinite families of such groups which occur in the two extremal cases for the fusion of $p$-subgroups: the case in which there exists exactly one $G$-conjugacy class of non-trivial cyclic $p$-subgroups, and the case in which there exist exactly $p+1$ distinct $G$-conjugacy classes of non-trivial cyclic $p$-subgroups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that for any polynomial $f: \mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Z}$ with positive leading coefficient and irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, if $N$ is large enough then there are two strings of consecutive positive integers $I_{1}=\{n_1-m,\ldots, n_1+m\}$ and $I_{2}=\{n_2-m, \ldots, n_2+m\}$, such that $m = [(\log N) (\log \log N)^{1/325525}]$, $I_{1}\cup I_{2} \subset [1, N]$, $N = n_1 + n_2$, and $f(n)$ is composite for any $n\in I_{1}\cup I_{2}$. This extends the result in [5] which showed the same result but with $f(n)=n$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages, subsequent to arxiv:2510.23333

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give the values of the Siegel-Veech constants associated with saddle connections having distinct endpoints on translation surfaces in Prym eigenform loci in $Ω\mathcal{M}_3(2,2)^{\rm odd}$. In particular, we show that these constants are actually the same for all of these loci. As a by-product, we show that the Euler characteristic of the Hilbert modular surfaces which parametrize Abelian surfaces with $(1,2)$-polarization admitting a real multiplication and the Euler characteristic of their product locus are related by a simple formula. For principally polarized Abelian surfaces, a similar phenomenon has been observed by Bainbridge.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\ell$ be an odd prime. We study the visibility theorem for certain elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ with additive reduction at $\ell$ and no degree $\ell$ isogeny defined over $\mathbb{Q}$, and deduce the existence of nontrivial $\ell$-torsion in $\Sha(E^D/\mathbb{Q})$ for suitable quadratic twists $E^D$. As an application for $\ell=3$, we exhibit pairs of non-isomorphic elliptic curves with the same BSD invariants, Kodaira symbols, and minimal discriminants, whose Tate--Shafarevich groups are isomorphic and have nontrivial $3$-primary parts.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages; comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we establish two main results concerning the Mumford-Tate conjecture for hyper-Kähler varieties. First, we prove the conjecture for the semisimplified $\ell$-adic Galois representations attached to hyper-Kähler varieties with second Betti number $b_2 \geq 4$. As a direct consequence, we deduce that the Hodge conjecture implies the Tate conjecture for powers of hyper-Kähler varieties. Second, we show that the Mumford-Tate conjecture for hyper-Kähler varieties is invariant under deformation. The proofs rely on comparing the ranks of $\ell$-adic algebraic monodromy groups in higher degrees to those in degree $2$ via the theory of Frobenius tori and the Looijenga-Lunts-Verbitsky Lie algebra.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages. Final version. To appear in Research in Number Theory

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article we study the endomorphism algebras of abelian varieties $A$ defined over a given number field $K$ with large cyclic 2-torsion fields. A key step in doing so is to provide criteria for all the endomorphisms of $A$ to be defined over $K(A[2])$, the field generated by its 2-torsion. When $K= \mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(A[2])/\mathbb{Q})$ is cyclic of prime order $p = 2 \dim(A) +1$, we prove that there are only finitely many possibilities for the geometric endomorphism algebra $\mathrm{End}(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$.In fact, when $\dim (A) \not \in \{3,5,9,21,33,81\}$, we show $\mathrm{End}(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ is a proper subfield of the $p$-th cyclotomic field. In particular, when $g=2$, $\mathrm{End}(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to either $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We exhibit examples of geometrically simple abelian surfaces $A/\mathbb{Q}$ with conductor bounded by $(10\,000)^2$ whose Tate--Shafarevich groups contain a subgroup isomorphic to $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^2$ for each $p = 5, 7, 11, 13$. To find these examples we generalise work of Cremona--Freitas to enumerate all congruences of a certain type between pairs of weight $2$ newforms $f \in S_2^{\mathrm{new}}(Γ_0(N))$ and $g \in S_2^{\mathrm{new}}(Γ_0(M))$ contained in the LMFDB (i.e., with $N, M < 10\,000$) and with coefficient fields of degree $\leq 4$. Passing from the modular forms to the corresponding abelian varieties we use visibility to (unconditionally) prove the existence of non-trivial elements of the Tate--Shafarevich group. Finally we construct an example of an abelian surface with $(\mathbb{Z}/7\mathbb{Z})^2 \subset \mathrm{Sha}(A/\mathbb{Q})$ which is (conjecturally) not visible in any abelian threefold.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a unital associative PI-algebra over a field of characteristic zero. We study which partitions $λ$ appear with nonzero multiplicities in the cocharacter sequence of $A$ for several classes of algebras $A$. Berele defines the eventual arm width $ω_0(A)$ to be the maximal integer $d$ so that if $λ$ appears with nonzero multiplicity in the cocharacter sequence of $A$, then $λ$ can have at most $d$ parts arbitrarily large. Berele also shows that if $A$ is Lie nilpotent, then $ω_0(A) = 1$. In the first part of this paper, we show that if $A$ is unital, then $ω_0(A) = 1$ if and only if $A$ is Lie nilpotent. To prove this statement, we show that the algebra of proper polynomials $B_n(A)$ is finite dimensional if and only if $A$ is Lie nilpotent. In the second part, we give a bound on the nonzero multiplicities $λ$ in the cocharacter sequence of $A$, when the T-ideal of identities of $A$ is equal to a product of T-ideals generated by long commutators. As an application, we show that for a Lie nilpotent algebra $A$, the nonzero multiplicities $m_λ(A)$ correspond to partitions $λ$ which are supported in step-like diagrams in which the number of steps grows with the index of Lie nilpotency. Finally, we give also some applications to the noncommutative invariant theory of the special linear group $\mathrm{SL}(n)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical notion of extreme $L_p$ discrepancy is a quantitative measure for the irregularity of distribution of finite point sets in the $d$-dimensinal unit cube. In this paper we find a dual integration problem whose worst-case error is exactly the extreme $L_p$ discrepancy of the underlying integration nodes. Studying this integration problem we show that the extreme $L_p$ discrepancy suffers from the curse of dimensionality for all $p \in (1,\infty)$. It is known that the problem is tractable for $p=\infty$; the case $p=1$ stays open.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Dirichlet series associated with the integers whose radix-$b$ representation misses certain (fixed) digits. The existence of a meromorphic continuation to the entire complex plane, which was already well-known as a general fact valid for $b$-automatic Dirichlet series, is proven anew from a representation as an everywhere defined series with good convergence properties. A generating function related to the residues on the real axis is shown to be the multiplicative inverse of the moment generating function for the associated Cantor set in the unit interval. This makes the (normalized) residues some sort of generalized Bernoulli numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f(x)=(x^{k}+c)^{m}-ax^{n}\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$, where $k,m,n\in\mathbb{N}$ with $km>n$, and let $K=\mathbb{Q}(θ)$, where $θ$ is a root of $f(x)$. We investigate the arithmetic properties of the number fields that arise from this family. We first obtain an explicit formula for the discriminant of $f(x)$. Using this formula, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the monogeneity of $f(x)$, expressed in terms of the prime divisors of $a$ and $c$ and the parameters $k,m,n$. This yields infinite families of monogenic polynomials of arbitrary degree, including families with a non-square-free discriminant. Building on these results, we extend our algebraic characterization to composite polynomials, establishing some explicit conditions for the monogeneity of the composition of $f(x)$ with an arbitrary polynomial $g(x)$. From an analytic point of view, we derive asymptotic estimates for the number of monogenic polynomials in these families under natural assumptions. We further study non-monogeneity via the field index $i(K)$ and, for each prime $p$, provide sufficient conditions ensuring $ν_p(i(K))=1$, yielding partial progress toward a problem of Narkiewicz. We also highlight a connection with a class of differential equations naturally associated with $f(x)$. As an application, we determine the conditions under which the splitting field of $f(x)$ has a full symmetric Galois group. Several explicit examples illustrate our results.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Our aim in this paper is to extend a work of Sivatski to characteristic 2. More precisely, for $F$ a field of characteristic $2$ and a central simple algebra $A$ of exponent 2 that splits over a triquadratic extension of $F$ of separability degree at least 4, we attach a cohomological invariant $\inv(A) \in H_2^3(F) / G$, where $H_2^3(F)$ is the third Kato-Milno cohomology group and $G$ is a subgroup of $H_2^3(F)$ divisible by the Brauer class of $A$. As an application, we will relate the decomposability of the algebra in degree 8 to the vanishing of $\inv(A)$. Moreover, we will use this invariant to prove some descent results for central simple algebras and quadratic forms over biquadratic extensions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** to appear in Mathematika

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{K}=\mathbb{F}_q((x^{-1}))$. Analogous to orthogonality in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a well-studied notion of ultrametric orthogonality in $\mathcal{K}^n$. In this paper, we extend the work of Soffer-Aranov and Behajaina on counting problems related to orthogonality in $\mathcal{K}^n$. For example, we resolve an open question posed in Soffer-Aranov and Behajaina by bounding the size of the largest ``orthogonal sets'' in $\mathcal{K}^n$. Furthermore, using similar ideas and techniques, we investigate analogues of Hadamard matrices over $\mathcal{K}$. Finally, we also use ultrametric orthogonality to compute the number of sublattices of $\mathbb{F}_q[x]^n$ with a certain geometric structure, and to determine the number of orthogonal bases of a sublattice in $\mathcal{K}^n$. The resulting formulas depend crucially on successive minima.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Traces of singular moduli were introduced and studied by Zagier in 1998. Being simultaneously the (traces of) values of a modular function ($j$-invariant) and Fourier coefficients of modular forms - which constitutes Zagier's duality - these integers are quite interesting. Since then, a substantial amount of research was devoted to various properties of these numbers, congruences in particular. We present an alternative point of view on these congruences, specifically, we view them as congruences between certain weight $3/2$ modular forms under repeated action of $U$-operator. That allows us to obtain a general result which includes some previously known results as special cases. Our approach is especially effective when the prime modulus is relatively small. In these cases, we obtain explanations for certain numerical observations and quantification of some previously known qualitative results. As an application, we obtain modulo $11$ congruences between the traces of singular moduli and class numbers of quadratic fields in the case when the twisted central special value of the $L$-function associated with the elliptic curve of conductor $11$ vanishes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}(W,S)$ be the Hecke algebra of the Coxeter system $(W,S)$ over $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm1}]$, where $W$ is the Weyl group of a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra. In this paper, we show that the matrix of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of $\mathcal{H}$ factorizes into a product of $|S|$ many matrices, each of which has entries as polynomials in $q$ with nonnegative coefficients. To achieve this goal, we use hybrid basis $TC^J$ for $J\subseteq S$ of $\mathcal{H}$, defined by Grojnowski-Haiman. The intermediate matrices in the aforementioned factorization turn out to be the transition matrices from $TC^J$-basis to $TC^I$-basis for $I\subset J$. Equivalently, these coefficients can be computed using a natural restriction map from $\mathcal{H}$ to the parabolic Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}_J$. Moreover, following the ideas from Grojnowski-Haiman, we also give a geometric proof of the positivity of these coefficients.</p></details>

As proof of the utility, we compiled a data set consisting of over 150,000 L-invariants. We analyze qualitative and quantitative features found in the data. This includes conjecturing a statistical law for the distribution of the valuations of L-invariants in a fixed level as the weights of eigenforms approach infinity. One novel point of our investigation is that the algorithm is sensitive to compiling data for fixed Galois representations modulo p. Therefore, we explain new perspectives on L-invariants that are related to Galois representations. We propose understanding the structures in our data through the lens of deformation rings and moduli stacks of Galois representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this follow-up paper, we again inspect a surprising relationship between the set of $m$-periodic points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ and the coefficient $c$, where $K$ is any number field of degree $n\geq 2$, $d>2$ is an integer and $m\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$ is any fixed (period). As before, we again study counting problems which are inspired by advances on $m$-torsion point-counting in arithmetic statistics and $m$-periodic point-counting in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any prime $p\geq 3$ and for any fixed $\ell\in \mathbb{Z}_{ \geq 1}$ and (period) $m\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$, the average number of distinct $m$-periodic integral points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is unbounded or zero as $c$ tends to infinity. Motivated further by $K$-rational periodic point-counting work of Benedetto along with conjectural work of Hutz on $m$-periodic points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ for any prime $p\geq 5$ and any fixed $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove that for any fixed (period) $m\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$, the average number of distinct $m$-periodic integral points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$ as $c\to \infty$. Finally, we then apply here density, polynomial-counting, field-counting, and Sato-Tate equidistribution results from arithmetic statistics, and thereby obtaining further counting and statistical results on the irreducible monic polynomials, Artin-Mazur zeta functions, algebraic number fields, and lastly on Artin $L$-functions arising naturally in our polynomial discrete dynamical settings.</p></details>

For any multiple index $\mathbf{s}=(s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_r) \in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}^r$ with $s_r>1$, the multiple zeta value (MZV for short) is defined by \begin{align*} ζ(s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_r):=\sum_{1\leq k_1<k_2<\cdots<k_r} \frac{1}{k_1^{s_1}k_2^{s_2}\cdots k_r^{s_r}} \end{align*} and the multiple $t$-value is defined by \begin{align*} t(s_1,s_2,...,s_r):=\sum_{1\leq k_1<k_2<...<k_r} \frac{1}{(2k_1-1)^{s_1}(2k_2-1)^{s_2}...(2k_r-1)^{s_r}}, \end{align*} where if the index is empty, then we define the value $t(\emptyset):=1$. We denote by $\{a_1,\cdots,a_k\}^d$ the sequence formed by repeating the sequence $\{a_1,\cdots,a_k\}$ exactly $d$ times. Let $H(a,b)=ζ(\{2\}^a,3,\{2\}^b)$ and $T(a,b):=t(\{2\}^a,3,\{2\}^b)$. In this paper, by using the Lai-Lupu-Orr integral expressions for $H(a,b)$ and $T(a,b)$ and the properties of Beta function and Gamma function, we show that for any nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$, we have \begin{align*} H(a,b):=\frac{-4π^{2a+2b+2}}{(2a+2)!}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{ζ(2n)}{(2n+2a+2)(2n+2a+3)\cdots(2n+2a+2b+3)2^{2n}} \end{align*} and \begin{align*} T(a,b)=\frac{-2}{(2a+1)!}\left(\fracπ{2}\right)^{2a+2b+2} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{ζ(2n)}{(2n+2a+1)(2n+2a+2)\cdots(2n+2a+2b+2)2^{2n}}. \end{align*} This confirms two conjectures of Lupu proposed in [C.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\ell$ and $m$ be positive integers with $\ell \leq m$, and let $\mathcal{A} = (A_1, \ldots, A_m)$ be a finite sequence of finite subsets of a group $G$ (not necessarily abelian), written multiplicatively. The {\it generalized product set} $Π^{\ell}(\mathcal{A})$ is the set of all elements of $G$ which can be represented as a product of exactly $\ell$ elements from $\ell$ distinct sets from $\mathcal{A}$ taken in any order. DeVos, Goddyn and Mohar obtained the nontrivial lower bound for the size of this product set when $G$ is abelian. The DeVos-Goddyn-Mohar Theorem is a fundamental result in additive combinatorics which unifies various results from zero-sum combinatorics and has connections with subsequence sums and sumsets. In this paper, we obtain an optimal lower bound for the size of generalized product set $Π^{\ell}(\mathcal{A})$ in torsion-free groups (not necessarily abelian), and characterize the structure of underlying sets in the sequence $\mathcal{A} = (A_1, \ldots, A_m)$ for which $Π^{\ell}(\mathcal{A})$ achieves the optimal lower bound. By slightly modifying the arguments of the proofs in the case of torsion-free groups, we derive such inverse theorems in cyclic groups of prime orders also. Our proof of these result also yields a new proof of DeVos-Goddyn-Mohar Theorem in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Moreover, we extend these inverse results to arbitrary abelian groups. Furthermore, as an application, we generalize a theorem for subsequence sums due to Hamidoune in torsion-free groups, and obtain several other results for subsequence sums in arbitrary groups.</p></details>

Under the (necessary) assumption that the fusion category is separable, we show that any algebra is Morita equivalent to an admissible quotient of the path algebra of a $\mathcal{C}$-species. Moreover, we show that an algebra is hereditary if and only if no further quotient is required. These results generalise that of Gabriel's for finite-dimensional algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a novel framework for bounding the adapted power gain $G_p$ and approximation gain $G_a$ of coprime integer solutions to the generalized diagonal superelliptic equation $By^n = Ax^n + k$ with $x, y \ge 2$. By first deriving a purely structural lower bound for $G_a$, we demonstrate that these equations are inherently predisposed to high ABC-qualities ($q = G_a \cdot G_p$). Combined with the Strong ABC conjecture ($q < q_{max}$), we prove that the power gain is uniformly bounded by $G_p < q_{max}/G_{a,min}$, providing a theoretical foundation for the numerical observation $G_p < 3$ for $n=2$ under the Ultra-Strong conjecture ($q < 1.5$). Specifically, we show that for $k=1$, the structural density forces $q > n/2$, which excludes solutions for $n \ge 4$ under $q < 2$. We validate our theoretical bounds using high-quality ABC triples, specifically analyzing the Reyssat (1987), de Weger (1985), and Nitaj (1993) cases to demonstrate the sharpness of the structural approximation gain.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the relationship between Serre duality and the Mukai pairing for smooth and proper dg-algebras. We introduce an alternative definition of the Mukai pairing and prove that it coincides with the Mukai pairings defined by Căldăraru--Willerton and by Shklyarov. Our construction places both the Mukai pairing and Serre duality within a unified framework based on an elementary pairing between Hochschild homology and Hochschild cohomology. As a consequence, the adjointness of the boundary--bulk and bulk--boundary maps follows naturally. As an application, we investigate Auslander--Reiten theory for the perfect derived category of a non-positive smooth and proper dg-algebra. We construct an exact triangle of dg-$A$-$A$-bimodules, called a universal Auslander--Reiten triangle in the sense that the derived tensor product of this triangle with an indecomposable dg-$A$-module $M$ yields an Auslander--Reiten triangle starting from $M$. In particular, this provides a functorial construction of Auslander--Reiten triangles. In the case of path algebras of quivers, our construction recovers the universal Auslander--Reiten triangle associated with quiver Heisenberg algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a lattice/linear code, we define the Voronoi spherical cumulative density function (CDF) as the CDF of the $\ell_2$-norm/Hamming weight of a random vector uniformly distributed over the Voronoi cell. Using the first moment method together with a simple application of Jensen's inequality, we develop lower bounds on the expected Voronoi spherical CDF of a random lattice/linear code. Our bounds are valid for any finite dimension and are quite close to a ball-based lower bound. They immediately translate to new non-asymptotic upper bounds on the normalized second moment and the error probability of a random lattice over the additive white Gaussian noise channel, as well as new non-asymptotic upper bounds on the Hamming distortion and the error probability of a random linear code over the binary symmetric channel. In particular, we show that for most lattices in $\mathbb{R}^n$ the second moment is greater than that of a Euclidean ball with the same covolume only by a $\left(1+O(\frac{1}{n})\right)$ multiplicative factor. Similarly, for most linear codes in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ the expected Hamming distortion is greater than that of a corresponding Hamming ball only by an additive universal constant.</p></details>

This generalizes our previous work which requires $d=1$ and restricts Schmidt-type counting estimates to approximation functions which decay fast enough. Novel techniques include a bootstrap scheme for the associated random walks despite algebraic obstructions, and a refined treatment of Dani's correspondence. Along the way, we also establish non-concentration properties of self-similar measures near algebraic subvarieties of $\mathbb{R}^d$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For two real bases $q_0, q_1 > 1$, a binary sequence $i_1 i_2 \cdots \in \{0,1\}^\infty$ is the $(q_0,q_1)$-expansion of the number $$ π_{q_0,q_1}(i_1 i_2 \cdots) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{i_k}{q_{i_1} \cdots q_{i_k}}. $$ Let $U_{q_0,q_1}$ be the set of all real numbers having a unique $(q_0,q_1)$-expansion. When the bases are equal, i.e., $q_0 = q_1 = q$, Allaart and Kong (2019) established the continuity in $q$ of the Hausdorff dimension of the univoque set $U_{q,q}$, building on the work of Komornik, Kong, and Li (2017). We derive explicit formulas for the Hausdorff dimension of $U_{q_0,q_1}$ and the entropy of the underlying subshift for arbitrary $q_0, q_1 > 1$, and prove the continuity of these quantities as functions of $(q_0, q_1)$. Our results also concern general dynamical systems described by binary shifts with a hole, including, in particular, the doubling map with a hole and (linear) Lorenz maps.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any ring $R$, we investigate balanced pairs of classes of modules and their relations to cotorsion triples. We characterize the case when a balanced pair generates a tilting cotorsion pair, and dually, when it cogenerates a cotilting cotorsion pair. If $R$ is right noetherian, we prove that the pair consisting of Gorenstein projective modules and Gorenstein injective modules is balanced if and only if $R$ is right virtually Gorenstein. In [4], cotorsion torsion triples in abelian categories were employed in the representation theory of rectangular grids occurring in persistent homology theory. For module categories, we use infinite dimensional tilting theory to completely classify all cotorsion torsion triples by means of $1$-resolving subcategories of $\rfmod R$, and to give an explicit 1-1 correspondence between the formally dual notions of cotorsion torsion triples of right $R$-modules and torsion cotorsion triples of left $R$-modules. This correspondence is bijective in case the underlying ring $R$ is left noetherian, but not in general.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Constructing permutation polynomials over finite fields, particularly those with simple algebraic structure in multiple variables, is a fundamental problem with applications in cryptography and coding theory. Recently, Li and Kaleyski (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2024) generalized two sporadic quadratic APN permutations into infinite families of trivariate functions. Motivated by their work, we investigate conditions under which generalized trivariate functions fail to be permutations. We establish necessary conditions on coefficient parameters that prevent the permutation property, provide a complete computational classification for small field extensions, and prove general non-permutation results. As a key application of our algebraic geometry approach, we resolve the permutation part of a conjecture by Beierle, Carlet, Leander, and Perrin (Finite Fields Appl., 2022) regarding a related trivariate form. Specifically, we prove that for all odd characteristic-2 extension degrees $m \geq 23$, their function $C_u$ is not a permutation over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}^3$ for any $u \in \mathbb{F}_{2^m}^*$, resolving the permutation part of their conjecture for sufficiently large fields.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 30 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We systematically analyze a class of hexanomial functions over finite fields of characteristic $2$ proposed by Dillon (2006) as candidates for almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions, significantly extending earlier partial-APN results. For functions over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, where $q=2^n$, of the form $$ F(x)=x(Ax^2+Bx^q+Cx^{2q})+x^2(Dx^q+Ex^{2q})+x^{3q}, $$ we derive necessary conditions on the coefficients $A,B,C,D,E$ for APNness using algebraic number theory and algebraic-geometry methods over finite fields. Our main contribution is a comprehensive case-by-case analysis that excludes large classes of Dillon hexanomials via vanishing patterns of key coefficient polynomials. We identify algebraic obstructions -- including absolutely irreducible components of associated varieties and degree incompatibilities in polynomial factorizations -- that prevent these functions from attaining optimal differential uniformity. These results substantially narrow the search space for new APN functions in this family and provide a framework applicable to other APN candidates. We complement the theory with extensive computations: exhaustive searches over $\mathbb{F}_{2^2}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^4}$, and random sampling over $\mathbb{F}_{2^6}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^8}$, yielding hundreds of APN hexanomials. Complete CCZ-equivalence testing shows that, although many examples occur, they fall into few distinct classes. For $q\in\{2,4\}$, all examples are CCZ-equivalent to the Budaghyan--Carlet family, while in larger dimensions none appear equivalent to that family.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We call a tensor functor $F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ between finite tensor categories $\otimes$-Frobenius if its left and right adjoints are isomorphic as $\mathcal{C}$-bimodule functors. We give several characterizations of this notion -- most notably, $F$ is $\otimes$-Frobenius if and only if the centralizer $Z({}_{F}\!{\mathcal{D}}_{\!F})$ is unimodular. We use them to analyze how actions on module categories behave under pullback along $F$. For perfect functors, we show that twisting a $\mathcal{D}$-module category $\mathcal{M}$ along $F$ preserves exactness, and that pivotality, unimodularity, and sphericality are preserved whenever $F$ is $\otimes$-Frobenius (or, more generally, Frobenius with respect to $\mathcal{M}$). Applications include: (i) explicit criteria for $\otimes$-Frobenius functors arising from bialgebra maps $f\!:\!H'\!\to\!H$ between finite-dimensional Hopf algebras; and (ii) criteria ensuring that objects of internal natural transformations are (symmetric) Frobenius algebras in $Z(\mathcal{C})$. Along the way we show that central tensor functors are Frobenius iff they are $\otimes$-Frobenius and that any tensor functor between separable fusion categories is $\otimes$-Frobenius, answering questions of Flake-Laugwitz-Posur.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study homotopy decompositions of the classifying spaces $BG$ of compact connected Lie groups obtained by (relative) fiber-cofiber construction. Given a pair of Borel fibrations $ F \to E \to BG $ and $F' \to E' \to BG $, this construction yields a tower (telescope) of spaces $ X_{m}(F,F') $ over $BG$ indexed by $ \mathbb{Z}_+ $ that converges in the sense that $\text{hocolim} \,(X_{m})\,$ is weakly homotopy equivalent to $BG$. We determine cohomological conditions on the fibrations that produce the spaces $X_{m}(F,F')$ with properties similar to those of the spaces of quasi-invariants of Weyl groups constructed by the first and third authors. We prove that, under these conditions, the resulting homotopy decompositions of $BG$ are sharp (over $\mathbb{Q}$), the spaces $X_{m}(F,F')$ are rationally formal and Cohen-Macaulay, their cohomology rings being finite rank free modules over $H^*(BG, \mathbb{Q})$. We construct many examples which include the fundamental (maximal torus) fibration $ G/T \to BT \to BG $ as well as the universal fibration $\, E_{\rm com}G_{\bf 1} \to B_{\rm com}G_{\bf 1} \to BG \,$ for the classifying space $B_{\rm com}G$ of commuting elements in $G$ introduced by Adem and Gómez, as the first fibration in the pair. In most cases, we give an explicit presentation for the (equivariant) cohomology rings in terms of characteristic classes and compute the (equivariant) $K$-theory of the spaces involved. The paper contains an Appendix, where we re-examine the topological fiber-cofiber construction in an abstract setting, proving an $\infty$-categorical extension of the classical Ganea Theorem.</p></details>

In this paper we develop a procedure to assist in establishing such a determination for a given quadratic field. Executing this procedure on all quadratic fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ with $|d| < 10^4$ we obtain, conditional on the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis, the determination of cyclic isogenies of elliptic curves over $19$ quadratic fields, including $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{213})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-2289})$. To make this procedure work, we determine all of the finitely many quadratic points on the modular curves $X_0(125)$ and $X_0(169)$, which may be of independent interest.</p></details>

Their main goal is to explain a proof of a theorem of A. Wassermann, that identifies the reduced C*-algebra of a real reductive group, up to Morita equivalence, with a direct sum of much simpler C*-algebras. Along the way we introduce the basic theory of representations and Morita equivalence of C*-algebras that is needed to understand the theorem and its proof. The target audience is Masters- and PhD-level students, and other mathematicians who are not specialists in operator algebras.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 58 pages; added stable fixed points for Gr(4,10)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms of cluster algebras and show that their induced action on the g-vectors can be realized by tropicalising their action on the homogeneous $\hat{y}$ (or $\mathcal{X}$) variables of a chosen initial cluster. This perspective allows us to interpret the action on g-vectors as a change of coordinates in the tropical setting. Focusing on Grassmannian cluster algebras, we analyse tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms in detail. We derive tropical analogues of the braid group action and the twist map on both g-vectors and tableaux. We introduce the notions of unstable and stable fixed points for quasi-automorphisms, which prove useful for constructing cluster monomials and non-real modules, respectively. As an application, we demonstrate that the counts of prime non-real tableaux with a fixed number of columns in $\mathrm{SSYT}(3, [9])$ and $\mathrm{SSYT}(4, [8])$, arising from the braid group action on stable fixed points, are governed by Euler's totient function. Furthermore, we apply our findings to scattering amplitudes in physics, providing a novel interpretation of the square root associated with the four-mass box integral via stable fixed points of quasi-automorphisms of the Grassmannian cluster algebra $\CC[\Gr(4,8)]$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In \cite{NZ25}, the authors resolved the rational function analogue of the finiteness results for greatest common divisors of iterates of polynomials established in \cite{HT17}. These results may be viewed as dynamical generalizations of a classical problem concerning upper bounds for the greatest common divisors (GCDs) of two integer sequences studied by Bugeaud, Corvaja, and Zannier. The most delicate case arises when the maps involved are automorphisms, where the methods of \cite{NZ25} and \cite{HT17} rely heavily on Diophantine approximation and asymptotic analysis. In the present paper, we develop an alternative approach to the automorphism case. This method is more powerful, allowing us to give complete answers to the further questions posed in \cite{HT17}. In particular, we strengthen the main theorem of \cite{HT17} and provide an alternative proof of the main theorem of \cite{NZ25} in the automorphism setting. Moreover, we relate this dynamical GCD problem to a special case of a higher-dimensional generalization of the Dynamical Mordell--Lang Conjecture proposed by Junyi Xie. We establish this generalized conjecture when the dynamics arise from algebraic group actions. In addition, we resolve the corresponding special case associated with dynamical GCD questions when the maps involved are polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Highest weight categories are an abstraction of the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras introduced by Cline, Parshall and Scott in the late 1980s. There are by now many characterisations of when an abelian category is highest weight, but most are hard to verify in practice. We present two new criteria - one numerical in terms of the Grothendieck group, and one in terms of Bridegland stability conditions - which are easier to verify. The stability criterion naturally generalises to a characterisation of properly stratified categories. The numerical criterion implies a criterion of Green and Schroll for when modules over a monomial algebra are highest weight.</p></details>

> **Comment:** A T-S Correlation is a kind of unexpected wonder for its many simple properties, compare the paper, see the Abstract

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Studying Correlations with Ramanujan Expansions, we arrive to present the new class of, say, Two-Seasons Correlations, abbr. T-S, as a natural set expressing some of the features of, say, H-L-like Correlations; these are the ones that mimic the H-L ($=$Hardy-Littlewood) Correlation with shift $2k$, needed to study $2k-$twin primes following Hardy \& Littlewood Conjecture. After introducing the $3-$Hypotheses Correlations in a previous paper, we add two other, very natural, hypotheses: the fifth is a technical one, simplifying calculations; but the fourth is called 'Parity', since it deals with the parity of natural numbers we play with. In particular, we may build (devoting to this 'our mainstream', here) a single Correlation that satisfies these '5 Axioms', thus a T-S one, that 'entangles two different Correlations' (whence Two-Seasons: T-S) depending on $a$ ($=$ the shift) parity. For $a$ even, our 'Artifact' mimics the H-L Correlation, in fact $a=2k$; but, while H-L Correlation is 'negligible', say, on $a$ odd, our Artifact seems to compare at least in the order of magnitude to H-L Correlation on $a$ even, being linked to another additive problem. Namely, on $a$ even, the Artifact 'counts', say, classic solutions to: $p_1+a=p_2$, in odd primes $p_1,p_2$; while, on $a$ odd, it 'counts' solutions to: $p_1+a=2^j p_2$, again with odd primes $p_1,p_2$ and with $j\in \N$ (satisfying the natural arithmetic constraints). More in general, our T-S Correlations 'entangle' two different Diophantine equations.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v1: 35 pages, comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By work of Davison and Meinhardt, the cohomological Hall algebra of a symmetric quiver with potential admits a geometrically defined filtration (the perverse filtration) whose associated graded is a supercommutative algebra. In the case of the triple quiver of a quiver with the canonical cubic potential, which corresponds to the preprojective algebra of the quiver via dimensional reduction, there is an additional filtration (the less perverse filtration), which is defined more generally for cohomological Hall algebras of suitably geometric 2-Calabi-Yau categories in work of Davison. In this paper, we show that the degenerations of the cohomological Hall algebras of preprojective algebras and more generally 2-Calabi-Yau categories with respect to the less perverse filtration is isomorphic to the enveloping algebra of the current Lie algebra of the BPS Lie algebra. This result applies in particular to CoHAs of local systems on Riemann surfaces and Higgs bundles on smooth projective curves. We extend this description to deformations of the cohomological Hall algebra obtained via torus actions on the arrows of the quiver and deformed canonical cubic potentials via the deformed dimensional reduction of Davison-Pădurariu. Last, we use our results to compare the less perverse filtration on CoHAs of preprojective algebras with the order filtration on the Maulik-Okounkov Yangian, via the comparison isomorphism of Botta-Davison and Schiffmann-Vasserot.</p></details>

They expressed the generating functions of $SOME(n)$ and $DSOME(n)$ in terms of $q$-series and found several interesting congruences modulo 4 and 5. In this paper, we express the generating function of $DSOME(n)$ in a closed form, which allows us to find some new congruences and internal congruences modulo 4 and 8 for $DSOME(n)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The purpose of this paper is to describe explicitly the modules of (Siegel-)Jacobi forms of degree two of index one of any scalar valued weight with respect to some congruence subgroups of small levels $N\leq 4$. Such a structure for the full Siegel modular group as a module over scalar valued Siegel modular forms of even weight has been explicitly given by T.~Ibukiyama. There we used an explicit structure theorem of rings of scalar valued Siegel modular forms by Igusa and that of vector valued Siegel modular forms of weight $\det^k\, \Sym^2$ by T. Satoh and T. Ibukiyama. On the other hand, for levels $N=2$, $3$, $4$, ring structures of scalar valued case have been also known by H. Aoki and T. Ibukiyama and $\det^k \Sym^2$-valued case by H. Aoki. In this paper, by merging these results, we give the same sort of simple structure theorems on modules of Jacobi forms of degree of two of index one for level $2$, $3$ and $4$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix a nonzero level $\mathfrak{n} \in \mathbb{F}_q[T]$. In this paper, we first establish a function field analogue of Ligozat's theorem, which serves as our main result and provides a criterion for Drinfeld modular units on the Drinfeld modular curve $X_0(\mathfrak{n})$. We further conjecture that this criterion characterizes all Drinfeld modular units; we verify the conjecture in the cases of prime power level and of level equal to the product of two primes. Second, as an application of Drinfeld modular units, we investigate the rational cuspidal divisor class group $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{n})$ of $X_0(\mathfrak{n})$. We construct an injective map $g$ from the group of degree $0$ rational cuspidal divisors on $X_0(\mathfrak{n})$ to the group of Drinfeld modular units on $X_0(\mathfrak{n})$ tensored with $\mathbb{Q}$ over $\mathbb{Z}$. As a result, we establish an explicit upper bound for the exponent of $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{n})$ for general level $\mathfrak{n}$.</p></details>

Our construction is based on a version of the BRST complex of the quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction. We show that the application of the Zhu functor to the vertex algebras $W^k(λ,μ)$ yields a family of generalized finite $W$-algebras $U(λ,μ)$ which we also describe independently as associative algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A fundamental theorem of Katz \cite{Katz87} determines the differential Galois groups of rank $n$ connections on algebraic curves with slope $r/n$ at a singularity, where $\gcd(r,n)=1$. We extend this result to $G$-connections, where $G$ is a simple algebraic group and the slope is $r/h$, with $h$ the Coxeter number of $G$ and $\gcd(r,h)=1$. This allows us to compute the differential Galois groups of a broad class of $G$-connections that have been central to recent advances in the geometric Langlands program and the Deligne--Simpson problem -- namely, Coxeter connections, generalised Frenkel--Gross connections, and Airy connections. We apply our results to inverse differential Galois theory by giving uniform and explicit constructions of $G$-connections whose differential Galois groups realise all reductive subgroups of maximal degree.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An invertible matrix is called a Perron similarity if it diagonalizes an irreducible, nonnegative matrix. Each Perron similarity gives a nontrivial polyhedral cone, called the spectracone, and polytope, called the spectratope, of realizable spectra (thought of as vectors in complex Euclidean space). A Perron similarity is called ideal if its spectratope coincides with the conical hulls of its rows. Identifying ideal Perron similarities is of great interest in the pursuit of the longstanding nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem. In this work, it is shown that the character table of a finite group is an ideal Perron similarity. In addition to expanding ideal Perron similarities to include a broad class of matrices, the results unify previous works into a single, theoretical framework. It is demonstrated that the spectracone can be described by finitely-many group-theoretic inequalities. When the character table is real, we derive a group-theoretic formula for the volume of the projected Perron spectratope, which is a simplex. Finally, an implication for further research is given.</p></details>

Under this definition, two expressions are identical if they represent the same rational function; for example, $x_1-x_2-x_3$ and $x_1-(x_2+x_3)$ are identical arithmetic expressions, as are $x_1(x_2+x_3)$ and $(x_2+x_3)x_1$. Two arithmetic expressions are said to be isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by a permutation of the variables. For example, $(x_1-x_2)/x_3$ and $(x_2-x_3)/x_1$ are isomorphic. The first few values of the number of non-isomorphic arithmetic expressions with n variables are: $$1,4,18,93,500,2844,16621,99674,608448,...$$ In order to accomplish this enumeration, we classify the set of all arithmetic expressions into 12 disjoint categories. Counting all non-isomorphic expressions in each category allows us to obtain the total required quantity.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Vladimir Gurvich, Mariya Naumova &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A number $N$ is a triangular number if it can be written as $N = t(t + 1)/2$ for some nonnegative integer number $t$. A triangular number $N$ is called square if it is a perfect square, that is, $N = d^2$ for some integer number $d$. Square triangular numbers were characterized by Euler in 1778 and are in one-to-one correspondence with the so-called near-isosceles Pythagorean triples $(k,k+1,l)$, where $k^2 + (k+1)^2 = l^2$. A quadratic number is the product $Π= Π(k,j) = k(k+1)(k+j)(k+j+1)$ for some nonnegative integer numbers $k$ and $j$. By definition, it is the product of two triangular numbers and 4. Quadratic number $Π$ and the corresponding pair $(k,j)$ are called square if $Π$ is a perfect square. Clearly, $(k,j)$ is square if both triangular numbers $k(k+1)/2$ and $(k+j)(k+j+1)/2$ are perfect squares. Yet, there exist infinitely many other square quadratic numbers. We construct polynomials $j_i(k)$ of degree $i$ with positive integer coefficients satisfying equations: $k + j_{2 \ell}(k) + 1 = k [a_\ell k^\ell + \dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 +1 = (k+1) [b_\ell k^\ell + \dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ and \newline $k + j_{2\ell+1}(k) + 1 = k(k+1) [a_\ell k^\ell + \dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 + 1 = [b_{\ell+1} k^{\ell+1}+b_\ell k^\ell + \dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ for some positive integer $\ell$ and some coefficients $a_i, b_j$, $i=0, \ldots, \ell, j=0, \ldots, \ell+1$. All the obtained pairs $(k, j_i(k))$ are square. We conjecture that the products of square triangular numbers and pairs $(k, j_i(k))$ cover all quadratic squares. Additionally, we identify pairs of intervals of successive integers with equal sums of squares.</p></details>

> **Comment:** New version in which we merged the paper with the concurrent paper of Alexey Elagin on the same subject. Exposition and content changed, in particular, the paper now includes a section with explicit calculations of the entropy and the upper and lower Serre dimensions for many well-known examples of gentle algebras

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the entropy of the Serre functor $\mathbb{S}$ in the partially wrapped Fukaya category of a graded surface $Σ$ with stops is given by the function sending $t \in \mathbb{R}$ to $ h_t(\mathbb{S}) = (1-\min Ω)t$, for $t\geq 0$, and to $h_t(\mathbb{S})=(1-\max Ω)t$, for $t\leq 0$, where $Ω= \{\frac{ω_1}{m_1} \ldots, \frac{ω_b}{m_b},0\}$, and $ω_i$ is the winding number of the $i$th boundary component $\partial_iΣ$ of the surface with $b$ boundary components and $m_i$ stops on $\partial_i Σ$. It then follows that the upper and lower Serre dimensions are given by $1-\min Ω$ and $1-\max Ω$, respectively. Furthermore, in the case of a finite dimensional gentle algebra $A$, we show that a Gromov-Yomdin-like equality holds by relating the categorical entropy of the Serre functor of the perfect derived category of $A$ to the logarithm of the spectral radius of the Coxeter transformation.</p></details>

We also provide other $2$- and $3$-modular lattices that are not locally universally optimal, or not even critical in the Gaussian core model.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 86 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by the $y$-ification of HOMFLY--PT homology by Gorsky and Hogancamp, and the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-action of Gorsky, Hogancamp, and Mellit, we construct $y$-ifications of Khovanov homology and its equivariant versions within Bar-Natan's framework for tangles, and define an action of the element $e$ in $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ on these $y$-ifications. We then prove that our construction is compatible with the previous ones under Rasmussen's spectral sequence from HOMFLY--PT homology to Khovanov homology. Our construction is elementary and well suited to diagrammatic manipulations and algorithmic implementations. As a result, we verify directly that these additional structures distinguish pairs of knots with identical Khovanov homology and HOMFLY--PT homology, in particular the Conway knot and the Kinoshita--Terasaka knot.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Abdelmalek Abdesselam, Shannon Starr &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.PR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for the number of joint orbits of random tuples of commuting permutations. In the uniform sampling case this generalizes the classic CLT of Goncharov for the number of cycles of a single random permutation. We also consider the case where tuples are weighted by a factor other than one, per joint orbit. We view this as an analogue of the Ewens measure, for tuples of commuting permutations, where our CLT generalizes the CLT by Hansen. Our proof uses saddle point analysis, in a context related to the Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotics and the theorem of Meinardus, but concerns a multiple pole situation. The proof is written in a self-contained manner, and hopefully in a manner accessible to a wider audience. We also indicate several open directions of further study related to probability, combinatorics, number theory, an elusive theory of random commuting matrices, and perhaps also geometric group theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give practical algorithms for computing the divisor class group and the gonality of a curve over a finite field, achieving several orders of magnitude speedup over existing methods for sufficiently large genus or residue field. The approach relies on introducing a precomputation step involving power series-expansions, which allows for an efficient amortized computation of large numbers of Riemann-Roch spaces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Lagarias inequality, an elementary criterion equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis. Using a continuous extension of the harmonic numbers, we show that the sequence $B_n=\frac{H_n+e^{H_n}\log(H_n)}{n}$ is strictly increasing for $n\ge 1$. As a consequence, if the Lagarias inequality has counterexamples, then the least counterexample must be a superabundant number; equivalently, it suffices to verify the inequality on the superabundant numbers.</p></details>
