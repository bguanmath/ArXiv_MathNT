<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\chi$ be an idele class character over a number field $F$, and let $\pi,\pi'$ be any two cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{A}_F)$. We prove that the Rankin-Selberg $L$-function $L(s,\mathrm{Sym}^2(\pi)\times(\mathrm{Sym}^2 (\pi')\otimes\chi))$ has a "standard" zero-free region with no exceptional Landau-Siegel zero except possibly when it is divisible by the $L$-function of a real idele class character. In particular, no such zero exists if $\pi$ is non-dihedral and $\pi'$ is not a twist of $\pi$. Until now, this was only known when $\pi=\pi'$, $\pi$ is self-dual, and $\chi$ is trivial.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 55 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Much of the work on Shimura varieties over the last thirty years has been devoted to constructing the theory that would follow from a good notion of motives, one incorporating the Hodge, Tate, and standard conjectures. These conjectures are believed to be beyond reach, and may not even be correct as stated. I argue in this article that there exists a theory of motives, accessible to proof, weaker than Grothendieck's, but with many of the same consequences.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 13 pages, to appear in International Journal of Number Theory

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using Galois representations, we analyze fields of definition of cyclic isogenies on elliptic curves to prove the following uniformity result: for any number field $F$ which has no rational CM, under GRH there exists an effectively computable constant $B:=B(F)\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that for any finite extension $L/F$ whose degree $[L:F]$ is coprime to $B$, one has for all elliptic curves $E_{/F}$ that any $L$-rational isogeny on $E$ is $F$-rational. For any number field $F$, under GRH we also prove results for the mod-$\ell$ Galois representations of non-CM elliptic curves with an $F$-rational isogeny of uniformly large prime degree $\ell$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Within the group algebras of the symmetric and hyperoctahedral groups, one has their descent algebras and families of Eulerian idempotents. These idempotents are known to generate group representations with topological interpretations, as the cohomology of configuration spaces of types A and B. We provide an analogous cohomological interpretation for the representations generated by idempotents in the peak algebra, called the peak representations. We describe the peak representations as sums of Thrall's higher Lie characters, give Hilbert series and branching rule recursions for them, and discuss a connection to Jordan brackets.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper introduces explicit Galois cohomological methods for determining the ranks of Bloch--Kato Selmer groups associated to the Tate twists of the 2-adic second \'etale cohomology of the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve with a rational Weierstrass point. In particular, this can give a method to determine the rational points on such curves via the Chabauty--Coleman--Kim method. This is applied to answer a question of Bugeaud, Mignotte, Siksek, Stoll and Tengely.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Harold Erazo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 42 pages, 4 tables, 3 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We exhibit new examples of regions of $M\setminus L$ where $M$ and $L$ denote the Markov and Lagrange spectra, respectively. These regions have a different nature from all known regions studied so far: they contain \emph{intruder sets} associated with distinct combinatorics that trespass the region where self-replication holds. Our construction follows the usual self-replication method but replaces the standard local uniqueness condition with a more flexible and weaker property. These examples emerged from a large-scale computational search for regions of $M\setminus L$, which indicates that many such regions with intruder sets exist. We conclude with some open problems about these new regions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article with study Tamagawa numbers of elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ that have isogenies or torsion points. More precisely, our aim is either to bound the set of primes primes that can divide their Tamagawa numbers or, when such a bound is not possible, to find infinite subfamilies whose Tamagawa numbers are as small as possible. Finally, we also investigate Tamagawa numbers of specializations of elliptic surfaces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $q$ be an odd prime power and $\mathbb{F}_q$ be the finite field of $q$ elements. We define the Rudin-Shapiro function $R$ on monic polynomials $f=t^n+f_{n-1}t^{n-1}+\dots + f_0\in\mathbb{F}_q[t]$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ by $$ R(f)=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}f_if_{i-1}. $$ We investigate the distribution of the Rudin-Shapiro function along irreducible polynomials. We show that the number of irreducible polynomials $f$ with $R(f)=\gamma$ for any $\gamma\in\mathbb{F}_q$ is asymptotically $q^{n-1}/n$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The aim of the paper is to define noncommutative cluster structure on several algebras ${\mathcal A}$ related to marked surfaces possibly with orbifold points of various orders, which includes noncommutative clusters, i.e., embeddings of a given group $G$ into the multiplicative monoid ${\mathcal A}^\times$ and an action of a certain braid-like group $Br_{\mathcal A}$ by automorphisms of each cluster group in a compatible way. For punctured surfaces we construct new symmetries, noncommutative tagged clusters and establish a noncommutative Laurent Phenomenon.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 49 pages; revised version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct integral models and special affinoids of suitable tubular neighborhoods of local Shimura varieties at depth-zero. We show that the reductions of the special affinoids over suitable tamely ramified extensions are realized as parabolic Deligne-Lusztig varieties and explicitly compute part of the middle $\ell$-adic \'{e}tale cohomology of local Shimura varieties at depth-zero. In the case of general linear groups, our construction recovers generalized semistable models of Lubin-Tate spaces at depth-zero constructed by Yoshida.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 36 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish multiple recurrence results for pretentious measure-preserving multiplicative actions along generalized Pythagorean triples, that is, solutions to the equation $ax^2 + b y^2 = c z^2$. This confirms the ergodic-theoretic form of the generalized Pythagorean partition regularity conjecture in this critical case of structured measure-preserving actions. As a consequence of our main theorem, any finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ generated by the level sets of finitely many pretentious completely multiplicative functions, must contain a monochromatic generalized Pythagorean triple.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Steven Finch &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Two distinct earlier preprints are relevant. The first covers half-iterates of $x(1+x)$, sin$(x)$ & exp$(x/e)$ and appears at arXiv:2506.07625v1. The second covers half-iterates of $x$exp$(x)$, $x+1/x$ & arcsinh$(x)$ and appears at arXiv:2506.07625v2. Reading these will help to motivate the study of $\delta$ in the current paper. 8 pages; 2 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The vivid contrast between two competing algorithms for solving Abel's equation $g(\theta(x)) = g(x) + 1$, given $\theta(x)$, is easily sketched. EJ is faster and more efficient, but ML evaluates a limit characterizing the principal solution $g(x)$ directly. EJ finds $g(x)+\delta$, where $\delta$ is possibly nonzero but independent of $x$. If we were to know an exact expression for $\delta$, then the "intrinsicality" of ML would be subsumed by EJ. Filling this gap in our knowledge is the aim of this paper.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present an analogue of Greenberg-Vatsal's and Emerton-Pollack-Weston's results on congruences of $p$-adic $L$-functions for $p$-non-ordinary cuspidal eigenforms $f$ and $g$ of equal weight that are $p$-congruent. In particular, we prove that the Iwasawa invariants of the analytic and algebraic signed $p$-adic $L$-functions of $f$ and $g$ are related by explicit formulae under appropriate hypotheses. We also show under the same assumptions that provided the algebraic and analytic $\mu$-invariants vanish, the signed Iwasawa main conjecture is true for $f$ if and only if it is true for $g$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Substantial revision of previous version and give a more conceptual proof of Mazur's conjecture on higher Heegner points

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a point $x_0$ in a Shimura variety attached to a Shimura datum of Hodge type $(G,X)$, we have an associated abelian scheme $A_0$. Fixing a non-empty finite set $\mathcal{S}$ of primes, we consider the simultaneous supersingular reduction modulo $\ell\in\mathcal{S}$ of (several copies of) $p$-adic Hecke orbits of $A_0$. We give a precise description of the image of this map. As an application, we give a more conceptual proof of Mazur's conjecture on non-torsionness of higher Heegner points on an abelian variety which is a quotient of the Jacobian of a Shimura curve. Our arguments simplify those of C.Cornut and V.Vatsal in two important aspects: (1) we do not need to assume the $p$-adic group $G^1(\mathbb{Q}_p)/Z_{G^1(\mathbb{Q}_p)}$ to be simple; (2) we do not need to consider separately the ``geometric" part and ``chaotic" part in the Hecke orbits.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The enumeration $d_k(n)$ of $k$-elongated plane partition diamonds has emerged as a generalization of the classical integer partition function $p(n)$. Congruences for $d_k(n)$ modulo certain powers of primes have been proven via elementary means and modular forms by many authors. Recently, Banerjee and Smoot established an infinite family of congruences for $d_5(n)$ modulo powers of 5. In this paper we have discovered an infinite congruence family for $d_3(n)$ and $d_5(n)$ modulo powers of 7.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $n$ be a non-negative integer. Combining algebraic and combinatorial techniques, we investigate for which pairs $(G,\rho)$ of a subgroup $G$ of the symmetric group $S_n$ and an irreducible character $\rho$ of $G$ the induced character $\rho\!\uparrow^{S_n}$ is multiplicity-free. As a result, for $n\geq 66$, we classify all subgroups $G\leq S_n$ which give rise to such a pair. Moreover, for the majority of these groups $G$ we identify all the possible choices of the irreducible character $\rho$, assuming $n\geq 73$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We recast congruences for the partition function through the geometry of supersingular elliptic curves. For primes $\ell\ge5$ inert in $K_n=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{1-24n})$ (equivalently $\big(\tfrac{1-24n}{\ell}\big)=-1$), we show that $p(n)\pmod{\ell}$ is a "supersingular trace'' on $X_0(6)$: a computable dot product on the level-$6$ Brandt module that is a twisted analogue of the Deuring--Eichler formula for class numbers. In the ramified case $\ell\in\{5,7,11\}$ (i.e. $\ell\mid(1-24n)$), a geometric "bonus valuation'' along supersingular fibers forces Ramanujan's congruences $$ p(5n+4)\equiv0\pmod5,\qquad p(7n+5)\equiv0\pmod7,\qquad p(11n+6)\equiv0\pmod{11}. $$ This phenomenon occurs because the supersingular $j$-invariants on $X_0(6)_{\mathbb{F}_\ell}$ for these primes lie over $\{0,1728\}$, allowing a certain Serre-Tate pullback to be regular at every supersingular point.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Inspired by orbit parametrizations in arithmetic statistics, we explain how to construct families of curves associated to certain nilpotent elements in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$-graded Lie algebras, generalizing work of Thorne to the $m\geq 3$ case and the non-simply laced case. We classify such families arising from subregular nilpotents in stable gradings and interpret almost all orbit parametrizations associated with algebraic curves appearing in the literature in this framework. As an extended example, we give a Lie-theoretic proof of the integral orbit parametrization of $5$-Selmer elements of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$, using a $\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z}$-grading on a Lie algebra of type $E_8$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 56 pages, 7 tables

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Chebotarev's density theorem asserts that the prime ideals are equidistributed among the conjugacy classes of the Galois group of any normal extension of number fields. An effective version of this theorem was first established by Lagarias and Odlyzko in 1977. In this article, we present an explicit refinement of their statement that applies to all non-rational fields, with every implicit constant expressed explicitly in terms of the field invariants. Additionally, we provide a sharper bound for extensions of sufficiently small degree. Our approach begins by proving an explicit formula for a smoothed prime ideal counting function. This relies on recent zero-free regions for Dedekind zeta functions, improved estimates on the number of low-lying zeros, and precise bounds for sums over the non-trivial zeros of the Dedekind $\zeta$-function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For rank-two $A$-motives defined over local fields with odd characteristic, we give an analogue of a theorem of Imai stating that abelian varieties with good reduction over $p$-adic fields have only finitely many torsion points values in cyclotomic towers. This implies the finiteness of torsion points of abelian Anderson $A$-modules. For rank-two Drinfeld $A$-modules over global function fields, we also give an analogue of a theorem of Ribet on torsion points of abelian varieties values in maximal cyclotomic extensions of number fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study rational points on the elliptic surface given by the equation: $$y^2 = x^3 + AxQ(u,v)^2 + BQ(u,v)^3,$$ where $A,B\in \mathbb{Z}$ satisfy that $4A^3-27B^2\neq 0$ and $Q(u,v)$ is a positive-definite quadratic form. We prove asymptotics for a special subset of the rational points, specifically those that are integral with respect to the singularity. This method utilizes Mordell's parameterization of integral points on quadratic twists on elliptic curves, which is based on a syzygy for invariants of binary quartic forms. Let $F(A,B)$ denote the set of binary quartic forms with invariants $-4A$ and $-4B$ under the action of $\textrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We reduce the point-counting problem to the question of determining an asymptotic formula for the correlation sums of representation numbers of binary quadratic and binary quartic forms, where the quartic forms range in $F(A,B)$. These sums are then treated using a connection to modular forms. In a stand-alone appendix, we study sums of absolute values of Hecke eigenvalues of $\textrm{GL}(2)$ representations that are tempered at all finite places. We show that these sums exhibit logarithmic savings over the trivial bound if and only if the representation is cuspidal. Further, we connect the problem of studying the sums of Hecke eigenvalues along polynomial values to the base change problem for $\textrm{GL}(2).$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the affine closure of the cotangent bundle of the parabolic base affine space for $\mathrm{GL}_n$ or $\mathrm{SL}_n$ is a Coulomb branch, which confirms a conjecture of Bourget-Dancer-Grimminger-Hanany-Zhong. In particular, we show that the algebra of functions on the cotangent bundle of the parabolic base affine space of $\mathrm{GL}_n$ or $\mathrm{SL}_n$ is finitely generated. We prove this by showing that, if we are given a map $H \to G$ of complex reductive groups and a representation of $G$ satisfying an assumption we call gluable, then the Coulomb branch for the induced representation of $H$ is obtained from the corresponding Coulomb branch for $G$ by a certain Hamiltonian reduction procedure. In particular, we show that the Coulomb branch associated to any quiver with no loops can be obtained from Coulomb branches associated to quivers with exactly two vertices using this procedure.</p></details>

We prove that almost every real number is transcendentally normal and provide an explicit construction of such a number, based on Sierpinski's covering method and novel ideas involving the so-called stretch function. In the next step, we transform this construction into an algorithm that computes the digits of a t-normal number recursively in all integer bases. Moreover, we extend our covering approach to construct and compute LIL-normal numbers whose discrepancies are of the order predicted by the law of the iterated logarithm.

For instance, we interpret the Gerasimov-Kharchev-Lebedev-Oblezin homomorphism into the algebra of difference operators via a finite analog of the Miura transform. This algebraic identification is deduced by relating degenerate affine Hecke algebras to the simplest example of a rational Feigin-Odesskii shuffle product. As a bonus, we obtain a presentation of the latter via a mirabolic version of the Kostant-Whittaker reduction.</p></details>

For this, we establish effective equidistribution of associated random walks on $\text{SL}_{d+1}(\mathbb{R})/\text{SL}_{d+1}(\mathbb{Z})$. This generalizes our previous work which requires $d=1$ and restricts Schmidt-type counting estimates to approximation functions which decay fast enough. Novel techniques include a bootstrap scheme for the associated random walks despite algebraic obstructions, and a refined treatment of Dani's correspondence.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a number field and let $G$ be a finitely generated subgroup of $K^\times$. For all but finitely many primes $\mathfrak p$ of $K$, the reduction $(G \bmod \mathfrak p)$ generates a well-defined subgroup of the multiplicative group of the residue field at $\mathfrak p$, and we may consider its index. We study the primes of $K$ for which this index lies in a given set of positive integers $S$. In particular, we prove that under certain convergence conditions on series associated to $S$ this problem can be addressed without assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), and we provide asymptotic formulas for the corresponding prime-counting functions. Problems of this type are related to Artin's primitive root conjecture, which has been proven under the assumption of GRH (Hooley, 1967).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For every irrational real $\alpha$, let $M(\alpha) = \sup_{n\geq 1} a_n(\alpha)$ denote the largest partial quotient in its continued fraction expansion (or $\infty$, if unbounded). The $2$-adic Littlewood conjecture (2LC) can be stated as follows: There exists no irrational $\alpha$ such that $M(2^k \alpha)$ is uniformly bounded by a constant $C$ for all $k\geq 0$. In 2016, Badziahin proved (considering a different formulation of 2LC) that if a counterexample exists, then the bound $C$ is at least $8$. We improve this bound to $15$. Then we focus on a ``B-variant'' of 2LC, where we replace $M(\alpha)$ by $B(\alpha) = \limsup_{n\to \infty} a_n(\alpha)$. In this setting, we prove that if $B(2^k \alpha) \leq C$ for all $k\geq 0$, then $C \geq 5$. For the proof we use Hurwitz's algorithm for multiplication of continued fractions by 2. Along the way, we find families of quadratic irrationals $\alpha$ with the property that for arbitrarily large $K$ there exist $\beta, 2\beta, 4 \beta, \ldots, 2^K \beta$ all equivalent to $\alpha$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct algorithms that efficiently generate random factorisations of values $P(n)$ as products of two integers, where $P\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is a given quadratic or cubic monic polynomial. In other words, the algorithms produce random triples $(n,d_1,d_2)\in\mathbb{Z}^3$ that solve the Diophantine equation $P(n) = d_1d_2$. In the case where $P$ is cubic, such an algorithm allows the construction of an RSA key of $k$ bits that can be described using about $k/3$ bits of information. We also show how to construct a solution $(n,d_1,d_2)$ with the ratio $d_1/d_2$ arbitrarily close to any given positive real number. This proves that among all solutions $(n,d_1,d_2)$ of $P(n) = d_1d_2$ the ratios $d_1/d_2$ are dense in $(0,+\infty)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a combinatorial identity relating Catalan numbers to tangent numbers arising from the study of peak algebra that was conjectured by Aliniaeifard and Li. This identity leads to the discovery of the intriguing identity $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}{2n\choose 2k+1}2^{2n-2k}(-1)^{k}E_{2k+1}=2^{2n+1}, $$ where $E_{2k+1}$ denote the tangent numbers. Interestingly, the latter identity can be applied to prove that $(n + 1)E_{2n+1}$ is divisible by $2^{2n}$ and the quotient is an odd number, a fact whose traditional proofs require significant calculations. Moreover, we find a natural $q$-analog of the latter identity with a combinatorial proof. This $q$-identity can be applied to prove Foata's divisibility property of the $q$-tangent numbers, which responds to a problem raised by Sch\"utzenberger.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a zero-relation algebra over a field $\mathcal K$, Crawley-Boevey introduced the concept of a tree module and provided a combinatorial description of a basis for the space of homomorphisms between two tree modules--the basis elements are called graph maps. The indecomposability of tree modules is essentially due to Gabriel. We relax a condition in the definition of a tree module to define generalised tree modules and when $\mathrm{char}(\mathcal K)\neq2$, under a certain condition, provide a combinatorial description of a finite generating set for the space of homomorphisms between two such modules--we call the generators generalised graph maps. As an application, we provide a sufficient condition for the (in)decomposability of certain generalised tree modules. We also show that all indecomposable modules over a Dynkin quiver of type $\mathbf D$ are isomorphic to generalised tree modules--this result also follows from a theorem of Ringel which states that all exceptional modules over the path algebra $\mathcal KQ$ of a finite quiver $Q$ are generalised tree modules.</p></details>

This provides a canonical bijection between local systems on the curve with divisorial log structure and multiplicative local systems on the framed logarithmic Picard (a logarithmic version of the Hecke eigensheaf correspondence of Geometric Langlands for GL_1. We use this to re-derive tamely ramified global Artin reciprocity for function fields, and show that logarithmic geometry allows for a geometric interpretation of local-to-global compatibility at all places (in addition to the unramified places).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates the dynamical properties of Dickson polynomials over finite fields, focusing on the periodicity and structural behavior of their iterated sequences. We introduce and analyze the sequence \( [D_n(x, \alpha) \mod (x^q - x)]_n \), where \( D_n(x, \alpha) \) denotes a Dickson polynomial of the first kind, and explore its periodic nature when reduced modulo \( x^q - x \). We derive explicit formulas for the period of these sequences, particularly in the case when \( n \) is coprime to \( q^2 - 1 \). In addition, we identify a symmetric property of the polynomial coefficients that plays a crucial role in the analysis of these sequences. Using tools from combinatorics, elementary number theory, and finite fields, we present algorithms to compute the exact period and investigate the dynamical structure of these polynomials. We also highlight open problems in cases where the degree \( n \) is not coprime to \( q^2 - 1 \). Our results offer deep insights into the algebraic structure of Dickson polynomials and their role in dynamical systems over finite fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the moduli space of framed quadratic differentials with prescribed singularities parameterized by a decorated marked surface with punctures (DMSp), where simple zeros, double poles and higher order poles respectively correspond to decorations, punctures and boundary components. We show that the fundamental group of this space equals the kernel of the Abel-Jacobi (AJ) map from the surface mapping class group of DMSp to the first homology group of the marked surface (without decorations/punctures). Moreover, a universal cover of this space is given by the space of stability conditions on the associated 3-Calabi-Yau category. Furthermore, when we partially compactify and orbifold this moduli space by allowing the collision of simple zeros and some of the double poles, the resulting moduli space is isomorphic to a quotient of the space of stability conditions on the deformed (with respect to those collidable double poles) 3-Calabi-Yau category. Finally, we show that the fundamental group of this partially compactified orbifold equals the quotient group of the kernel of the AJ map by the square of any point-pushing diffeomorphism around any collidable double pole. This construction can produces any non-exceptional spherical/Euclidean Artin braid groups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 44 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Under the generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), Baluyot, Chandee, and Li nearly doubled the range in which the density of low lying zeros predicted by Katz and Sarnak is known to hold for a large family of automorphic $L$-functions with orthogonal symmetry. We generalize their main techniques to the study of higher centered moments of the one-level density of this family, leading to better results on the behavior near the central point. Numerous technical obstructions emerge that are not present in the one-level density. Averaging over the level of the forms and assuming GRH, we prove the density predicted by Katz and Sarnak holds for the $n$-th centered moments for test functions whose Fourier transform is compactly supported in $(-\sigma, \sigma)$ for $\sigma~=~\min\left\{3/2(n-1), 4/(2n-\mathbf{1}_{2\nmid n})\right\}$. For $n=3$, our results improve the previously best known $\sigma=2/3$ to $\sigma=3/4$. We also prove the two-level density agrees with the Katz-Sarnak density conjecture for test functions whose Fourier transform is compactly supported in $\sigma_1 = 3/2$ and $\sigma_2 = 5/6$, respectively, extending the previous best known sum of supports $\sigma_1 + \sigma_2 = 2$. This work is the first evidence of an interesting new phenomenon: by taking different test functions, we are able to extend the range in which the Katz-Sarnak density predictions hold. The techniques we develop can be applied to understanding quantities related to this family containing sums over multiple primes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The eigenvectors of the $(N+1)\times (N+1)$ symmetric Pascal matrix $T_N$ are analogs of prolate spheroidal wave functions in the discrete setting. The generating functions of the eigenvectors of $T_N$ are prolate spheroidal functions in the sense that they are simultaneously eigenfunctions of a third-order differential operator and an integral operator over the critical line $\{z\in\mathbb{C}: \text{Re}(z) = 1/2\}$. For even, positive integers $N$, we obtain an explicit formula for the generating function of an eigenvector of the symmetric pascal matrix with eigenvalue $1$. In the special case when $N=p-1$ for an odd prime $p$, we show that the generating function is equivalent modulo $p$ to $(\# E_z(\mathbb F_p)-1)^2$, where $\# E_z(\mathbb F_p)$ is the number of points on the Legendre elliptic curve $y^2 = x(x-1)(x-z)$ over the finite field $\mathbb F_p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a finite unramified extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_F$, and let $\mathbf{G}$ denote a split, connected reductive group over $\mathcal{O}_F$. We fix a Borel subgroup $\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{T}\mathbf{U}$ with maximal torus $\mathbf{T}$ and unipotent radical $\mathbf{U}$, and let $L(\lambda)$ denote an irreducible representation of $G_0 := \mathbf{G}(\mathcal{O}_F)$ with coefficients in a sufficiently large field of characteristic $p$. Set $G := \mathbf{G}(F)$, etc. Assuming $\lambda$ is a $p$-small and sufficiently regular character and that $p - 1$ is greater than the Coxeter number of $\mathbf{G}$, we show that the complex $L(U,\textrm{c-ind}_{G_0}^{G}(L(\lambda)))$ splits as the orthogonal direct sum of its cohomology objects in the derived category of smooth $T$-representations in characteristic $p$. (Here $L(U, -)$ denotes Heyer's left adjoint of parabolic induction, from the derived category of smooth $G$-representations to the derived category of smooth $T$-representations.) Consequently, this gives rise to a collection of morphisms of graded spherical Hecke algebras $$\displaystyle{\bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}\textrm{Ext}_{G}^{i}\left(\textrm{c-ind}_{G_0}^{G}(L(\lambda)),~\textrm{c-ind}_{G_0}^{G}(L(\lambda))\right) \longrightarrow \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}\textrm{Ext}_{T}^{i}\left(\textrm{c-ind}_{T_0}^{T}(L^n(U_0,L(\lambda))),~\textrm{c-ind}_{T_0}^{T}(L^n(U_0,L(\lambda)))\right)}$$ indexed by $n=-[F:\mathbb{Q}_p]\dim(\mathbf{U}), \ldots, 0$, which we refer to as derived Satake morphisms. For $\lambda=0$ and $n=0$, this recovers the graded mod $p$ Satake homomorphism constructed by Ronchetti. We also give some partial results for general standard parabolic subgroups $\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{M}\mathbf{N} \subset \mathbf{G}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a prime $p\equiv 1 \,(\bmod{4})$, let $$ \varepsilon = \frac{1}{2}\left( t + u\sqrt{p}\right) $$ be the fundamental unit of the real quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p})$. In 1951, N. Ankeny, E. Artin, and S. Chowla asked whether $p$ can divide $u$. They suggested that this can never happen and this has since been called the Ankeny--Artin--Chowla (AAC) conjecture. We show that if $\mathfrak{p}$ is the prime above $p$ in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p})$, then the AAC conjecture is false if and only if $$ \varepsilon^{p-1} \equiv 1\, (\bmod{\mathfrak{p}^2}). $$ Thus, the AAC conjecture is related to the existence of number field analogues of Wieferich primes. Therefore, in the second part of this paper, we investigate the infinitude of Wieferich primes in number fields. Subject to Masser's $abc$-conjecture for number fields, we prove that for any fixed $\alpha\in \mathcal{O}_K\setminus\{0\}$ that is not a root of unity, there are infinitely many primes ideals $\mathfrak{p}\subseteq \mathcal{O}_K$ for which $$ \alpha^{N(\mathfrak{p})-1} \not\equiv 1\, (\bmod{\mathfrak{p}^2}). $$ Additionally, we show under the weaker assumption that there are finitely many base-$\alpha$ super-Wieferich primes, and that there are infinitely many base-$\alpha$ non-Wieferich primes. In both cases, we obtain the lower bound $$ \#\left\{\text{prime ideals } \mathfrak{p} : N(\mathfrak{p})\leq x \text{ and } \alpha^{N(\mathfrak{p})-1}\not\equiv 1 \,(\bmod{\mathfrak{p}^2})\right\} \gg_{K, \alpha, \varepsilon} \frac{\log x}{\log\log x} $$ as $x\to \infty$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a conjecture of Hiraga-Ichino-Ikeda relating formal degrees of square-integrable representations to adjoint gamma factors for symplectic and even orthogonal groups over characteristic zero non-Archimedean local fields. The proof is based on the twisted endoscopic characterization of the local Langlands correspondence for such groups and extends an approach already appearing in the original paper of Hiraga-Ichino-Ikeda itself inspired from earlier work of Shahidi. Namely, the argument consists in computing in two different ways a residue of certain standard intertwining operators suitably extended to a large representation realized on an explicit space of functions. This gives rise to the spectral decomposition of certain singular twisted orbital integrals. The main theorem follows from a comparison of this identity with the Plancherel formula of a symplectic or even orthogonal group. The proof can be adapted to deal with other classical groups, namely odd orthogonal and unitary groups, but the formal degree conjecture was already established in these cases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In arXiv:1812.00170, S. Morier-Genoud and V. Ovsienko introduced the notion of the $q$-rational number $[x]_q$, $x\in \Bbb Q$, a rational function specializing to $x$ at $q=1$, obtained by $q$-deforming the continued fraction expansion of $x$. In arXiv:1908.04365 they introduced $q$-real numbers $[x]_q$, $x\in \Bbb R$ - a Laurent series in $q$ converging to the rational function $[x]_q$ when $x\in \Bbb Q$. In arXiv:2102.00891 it is proved that if $x\in \Bbb Q_{>1}$ then the series $[x]_q$ converges for $|q|<3-2\sqrt{2}\approx 0.17$ and conjectured that for all $x\in \Bbb R_{>1}$ this series converges in some disk centered in the origin, with the expected common radius of convergence $R_*=\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2}\approx 0.38$, achieved when $x=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ is the golden ratio. This was proved for rational $x$ in arXiv:2405.15970 using the theory of Kleinian groups. In this paper we (partially) prove this conjecture by showing that for all $x\in \Bbb R_{>1}$, the series $[x]_q$ converges in the disk $|q|<3-2\sqrt{2}$ to a nonvanishing holomorphic function. This is achieved by giving an expansion of $1/[x]_q$ into a $q$-adically convergent series of rational functions converging absolutely and uniformly on compact sets in an explicit region $D$ containing this disk. We also show that this expansion converges to a positive analytic function on the interval $(-\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2},1)$, giving a definition of $[x]_q$ for $q$ from this interval. Moreover, we show that the result of arXiv:2405.15970 implies convergence of $[x]_q$ for $|q|<2-\sqrt{3}\approx 0.27$. We also give examples of explicit computation of $[x]_q$ for transcendental numbers $x$, e.g. $x={\rm cotan}(1)$. Finally, we propose a definition of the $q$-complex number $[\tau]_q$, a meromorphic function of $\tau\in \Bbb C_+$ which expresses via hypergeometric functions of modular functions of $\tau$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We revisit the proposed equality between discrete Fourier transforms of $p$-adic $\Gamma_p$--values and $p$-adic $L$--derivatives for odd characters modulo a prime $p$. The clean identity is false in general. Building on Coleman reciprocity and the Gross--Koblitz formula, we prove an exact two-term decomposition: for each odd, nontrivial Dirichlet character $\chi \pmod p$, $$ \Phi_p (\chi):=\sum_{a=1}^{p-1}\chi(a)\,\log_p \Gamma_p \!\left(\frac{a}{p-1}\right) = U_{1,p}\,L'_p(0,\chi)\;+\;U_{2,p}\,L(0,\chi), $$ with constants $U_{1,p}\in\mathbb{Q}_p(\mu_{p-1})^\times$ and $U_{2,p}\in\mathbb{Q}_p(\mu_{p-1})$ depending only on $p$ and the fixed branch of $\log_p$, but independent of $\chi$. Subtracting the $L(0,\chi)$--block yields a \emph{renormalized} local input $$ \Phi^{ren}_p(\chi):=\Phi_p(\chi)-U_{2,p}L(0,\chi)=U_{1,p}\,L'_p(0,\chi), $$ uniformly in odd, nontrivial $\chi$. Plumbing these renormalized locals at every finite place into the Weil explicit formula (with the standard Li kernel at $\infty$) reproduces exactly the classical Li coefficients. We also record a short, reproducible verification protocol; a tiny table for $p=5,7$ illustrates the $\chi$--independence of $(U_{1,p},U_{2,p})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the mutual energy (or the intersection product in the sense of Arakelov theory) of two dynamical systems associated to Latt\`es morphisms over $\mathbf{\bar Q}$ is uniformly bounded below and deduce a proof of a conjecture of Bogomolov-Fu-Tschinkel: the number of common images of torsion points of two non-isomorphic elliptic curves over $\mathbf{C}$ by a standard morphism to the projective line is uniformly bounded. The proof crucially relies on the theory of Berkovich spaces over $\mathbf{Z}$ and on an original argument allowing to obtain a global estimate from a central estimate (over a trivially valued field).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the dynamics of planons, particles whose mobility is restricted to a plane, through the classification of coadjoint orbits and unitary irreducible representations of the centrally extended planon group. Planons are closely related to Galilei/Bargmann symmetries and, remarkably, the often-ignored massless coadjoint orbits of the Galilei group play a central r\^ole in their description. We thereby provide a nontrivial physical interpretation of these orbits. We further construct classical and quantum dipoles as bound states of monopoles, where the restricted planar motion arises from a novel mixed Carroll-Galilei symmetry. We also argue that the simplest and already experimentally realised systems with Carroll symmetry are in crystals.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The concept of cluster towers was introduced by the second author and Krithika in [4] along with a question which was answered by the first author and Bhagwat in [1]. In this article we introduce the concept of minimal generating sets of splitting field and connect it to the concept of cluster towers. We establish that there exist infinitely many irreducible polynomials over rationals for which the splitting field has two extreme minimal generating sets (one of given cardinality and other of minimum cardinality) and for which we have two extreme minimal cluster towers (one of given length and other of minimum length). More generally, we establish that for a certain family of polynomials over the rationals, we have minimal generating sets of all cardinalities in a certain range and that these are the only possible cardinalities for minimal generating set for such a polynomial. We also establish an equivalent condition for a set to be minimum minimal generating set for this family of polynomials and count the total number of minimum minimal generating sets. We prove interesting properties of cluster tower associated with minimal generating set that we constructed in proof of the first theorem and as a consequence get that degree sequence depends on the ordering even when we work with minimal generating set.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a global field, $K/k$ be a finite separable field extension and $L/k$ be the Galois closure of $K/k$ with Galois groups $G={\rm Gal}(L/k)$ and $H={\rm Gal}(L/K)\lneq G$. In 1931, Hasse proved that if $G$ is cyclic, then the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. We show that if $G$ is metacyclic with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$, then $H$ is cyclic and the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. Some examples of metacyclic, dihedral, quasidihedral, modular, generalized quoternion, extraspecial groups and $Z$-groups $G$ with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$ are given. As a consequence, we get the Tamagawa number $\tau(T)=|G^{ab}|/|H|$ of the norm one tori $T=R^{(1)}_{K/k}(\mathbb{G}_m)$ of $K/k$ via Ono's formula $\tau(T)=|H^1(k,\widehat{T})|/|Sha(T)|$ where $G^{ab}$ is the abelianization of $G$, $\widehat{T}={\rm Hom}(T,\mathbb{G}_m)$ is the character module of $T$ and $Sha(T)$ is the Shafarevich-Tate group of $T$. As an appendix of this paper, we also give some examples of finite simple groups $G$ with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$. This provides examples which the Hasse norm principle holds for Galois extensions $K/k$ with $G={\rm Gal}(K/k)$ by Tate's theorem.</p></details>

The novel local ingredients are the construction of improved Ash--Ginzburg Shalika functionals and production of Friedberg--Jacquet test vectors relating local zeta integrals to automorphic $L$-functions beyond the spherical level. Our proofs rely on a generalization of Shahidi's theory of local coefficients to Shalika models, for which we establish a general factorization formula related to the exterior square automorphic $L$-function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the hyperrigidity of subsets of unital $C^*$-algebras annihilated by states (or, more generally, by completely positive maps). This is closely related to the concept of rigidity at $0$ introduced by G. Salomon, who studied hyperrigid subsets of Cuntz and Cuntz-Krieger algebras. The absence of the unit in a hyperrigid set allows for the existence of $R$-dilations with non-isometric $R$. The existence of such an $R$-dilation forces the state annihilating the hyperrigid set to be a character. Using a dilation-theoretic approach, we provide multiple equivalent criteria for hyperrigidity involving intertwining relations for representations, valid in both commutative and noncommutative settings. We develop structural models for such dilations via orthogonal decompositions into two or three components, determined by defect operators and generalized eigenspaces associated with underlying representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The main objective of this paper is twofold. One is to classify and construct $SL(3,\mathbb{R})$-intertwining differential operators between vector bundles over the real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^2$. It turns out that two kinds of operators appear. We call them Cartan operators and PRV operators. The second objective is then to study the representations realized on the kernel of those operators both in the smooth and holomorphic setting. A key machinery is the BGG resolution. In particular, by exploiting some results of Davidson-Enright-Stanke and Enright-Joseph, the irreducible unitary highest weight modules of $SU(1,2)$ at the (first) reduction points are classified by the image of Cartan operators and kernel of PRV operators.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The relationship between Salem numbers and short geodesics has been fruitful in quantitative studies of arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds, particularly in dimensions 2 and 3. In this article, we push these connections even further. The primary goals are: (1) to bound the proportion of Salem numbers of degree up to $n+1$ in the commensurability class of classical arithmetic lattices in any odd dimension $n$; (2) to improve lower bounds for the strong exponential growth of averages of multiplicities in the geodesic length spectrum of non-compact arithmetic orbifolds. In order to accomplish these goals, we bound, for a fixed square-free integer $D$, the count of Salem numbers with minimal polynomial $f$ satisfying $f(1)f(-1)=-D$ in $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}/\mathbb{Q}^{\times 2}$. To do this, we make use of results on the distribution of Salem numbers, as well as classical methods for counting Pythagorean triples and Gauss' lattice-counting argument. To this end, we give a generalization of the count of Pythagorean triples and provide an elementary proof which may be of independent interest.</p></details>

In this case, $F$ is called an isolation of $f$. In this article, we prove that there does not exist a binary isolation of any unary quadratic form. We also prove that there does not exist a ternary isolation of any binary quadratic form. Furthermore, if the form class group of a primitive binary quadratic form has no element of order $4$, then the discriminant of any quaternary isolation of it, if exists, is a square of an integer. The composition laws of primitive binary quadratic forms play an essential role in the proofs of the results.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The P\'{o}lya group $Po(K)$ of an algebraic number field $K$ is the subgroup of the ideal class group $Cl_{K}$ generated by the ideal classes of the products of prime ideals of the same norm. If $Po(K)$ is trivial, then the number field $K$ is said to be a P\'{o}lya field. In this article, we furnish three families $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p},\sqrt{qrs})$, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2p},\sqrt{qrs})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2p},\sqrt{2qrs})$ of bi-quadratic P\'{o}lya fields $K$ involving prime numbers $p,q,r$ and $s$ that satisfy certain quadratic residue conditions. It is worthwhile to note that in each of the fields, exactly five primes ramify in $K/\mathbb{Q}$ and this is the maximum possible number of ramified primes in a P\'{o}lya field over $\mathbb{Q}$. Towards the end of the paper, we discuss about large P\'{o}lya groups of the compositums of Shank's cubic fields and Lehmer's quintic fields and prove that there are infinitely many such fields with index $1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Keating--Snaith conjecture for orthogonal families may be viewed as analogous to a Gaussian distribution with a negative mean, and the possibility that mixed moments resemble a composition of independent moments, these two insights were combined and applied in Lester and Radziwi\l\l's proof of quantum unique ergodicity for half-integral weight automorphic forms, via Soundararajan's method under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH). This observation also yields a crucial and nontrivial saving in the resolution of certain arithmetic problems. Inspired by this, we select a series of typical mixed orthogonal families of $L$-functions: $\mathrm{GL}_2$ quadratic twisted families. Under the assumptions of the GRH and the Generalized Ramanujan Conjecture, we prove upper bound estimates for their moments and present the following three arithmetic applications: i) The decorrelation of automorphic periods averaged over imaginary quadratic fields. ii) The decorrelation of Fourier coefficients of half-integral weight modular forms. iii) The decorrelation of the analytic orders of isotropy subgroups of Tate--Shafarevich groups of elliptic curves under quadratic twists.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras are studied from the perspective of representation types. We establish that (like other representation types) the notions of $E$-finiteness and $E$-tameness are invariant under mutations of quivers with potentials. Consequently, by applying our results on laminations on marked surfaces, and the results of Plamondon and the second author, we classify $E$-finite and $E$-tame finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras. More precisely, we demonstrate that (resp., except for a few cases,) a finite-dimensional Jacobian algebra $\mathcal{J}(Q,W)$ is $E$-finite (resp., $E$-tame) if and only if it is $\mathrm{g}$-finite (resp., $\mathrm{g}$-tame), if and only if it is representation-finite (resp., representation-tame), and this holds exactly when $Q$ is of Dynkin type (resp., finite mutation type), as shown by Geiss, Labardini and Schr\"{o}er. Futhermore, we provide an application of our results in the theory of cluster algebras. More precisely, the converse of Reading's theorem is established: if the $\mathrm{g}$-fan of the cluster algebra associated with a connected quiver $Q$ is complete, then $Q$ must be of Dynkin type.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For each integer $n\geq 1$, we construct a $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb Q)$-invariant modular symbol $\bm\xi_n$ with coefficients in a space of distributions that takes values in the Milnor $K_n$-group of the modular function field. The Siegel distribution $\bm\mu$ on $\mathbb Q^2$, with values in the modular function field, serves as the building block for $\bm\xi_n$; we define $\bm\xi_n$ essentially by taking the $n$-Steinberg product of $\bm\mu$. The most non-trivial part of this construction is the cocycle property of $\bm\xi_n$; we prove it by using an induction on $n$ based on the first two cases $\bm\xi_1$ and $\bm\xi_2$; the first case is trivial, and the second case essentially follows from the fact that Beilinson-Kato elements in the Milnor $K_2$-group modulo torsion satisfy the Manin relations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Iizuka's conjecture predicts that, given $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and a prime $p$, there exists infinitely many integers $n$ such that the class numbers of \textit{all} of the following quadratic number fields, $$ \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n}),\ \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n+1}),\ \ldots,\ \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n+m}), $$ are divisible by $p$. In this article, given $k$ and $m$, we study the proportion of $n$ such that the class numbers of \textit{none} of the successive fields $$ \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n}),\ \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n+1}),\ \ldots,\ \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n+m}), $$ are divisible by \( 3^k \). Moreover, we study the proportion of imaginary biquadratic fields whose class numbers are not divisible by $3$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By analyzing the coefficients of the power series defining the Kubota--Leopoldt $p$-adic $L$-function associated to the non-trivial character of a real quadratic field, we prove a congruence of Ankeny--Artin--Chowla-type for prime power modulus. Additionally, we show how some classical congruences relating Bernoulli numbers and Wilson quotients fit naturally into the theory of the $p$-adic Riemann zeta function.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Joel E. Cohen &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A positive integer $n$ is defined to be cyclic if and only if every group of size $n$ is cyclic. Equivalently, $n$ is cyclic if and only if $n$ is relatively prime to the number of positive integers less than $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$. Because every prime number is cyclic, it is natural to ask whether a (proved or conjectured) property of primes extends to cyclic numbers. I review proved or conjectured properties of primes (including some new conjectures about primes) and propose analogous conjectures about cyclic numbers. Using the 28,488,167 cyclic numbers less than $10^8$, I test the conjectures about cyclic numbers and disprove the cyclic analog of the second conjecture about primes of Hardy and Littlewood. Proofs or disproofs of the remaining conjectures are invited.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A linear combination $aT_r(m)+bT_s(n)$ of an \mbox{$r$-gonal} number $T_r(m)$ and an $s$-gonal number $T_s(n)$ with mutually coprime positive integer coefficients $a$ and $b$ produces infinitely many primes as $m$ and~$n$ varies over the natural numbers, whereas the sum of the reciprocals of such primes converges unless $T_r(m)=m^2$ and $T_s(n)=n^2$. For each pair of coprime positive integers $a$ and $b$, there are arbitrary long arithmetic progressions among the primes of the form $am^2+bn^2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A rooted tree module (RTM) $M:=M(T,F)$ over a zero-relation algebra $\Lambda:=\mathcal KQ/\langle\rho\rangle$ over a field $\mathcal K$ is given by the data of a quiver morphism $F:T\to Q$ from a rooted tree $T$ (either with a source or a sink) taking paths in $T$ to paths in $Q$ not lying in $\langle\rho\rangle$. When $\mathrm{char}(\mathcal K)\neq2$, we provide a checkable combinatorial characterization of the indecomposability of the RTM $M$ in terms of non-existence of idempotent quiver morphisms $\iota:T\to T$ satisfying $F\circ\iota=F$ and $\iota\neq 1_T$. Further, we provide an iterative method to decompose an RTM into indecomposable RTMs as well as a method to recursively construct indecomposable RTMs.</p></details>
