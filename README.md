 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yucong Du, Xin Huang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Added Section 3; introduced the $\eta$-twisted group superalgebras and the $\eta$-twisted wreath superproducts, where $\eta\in \{\pm\}$; enhenced the generality of many results

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Kleshchev and Livesey proved the existence of RoCK $p$-blocks for double covers of symmetric and alternating groups over large enough coefficient rings. They proved that these RoCK blocks of double covers are Morita equivalent to standard ``local" blocks via bimodules with endopermutation source. Based on this, Kleshchev and Livesey proved that RoCK blocks are splendidly Rickard equivalent to their Brauer correspondents. The analogous result for blocks of symmetric groups, a theorem of Chuang and Kessar, was an important step in Chuang and Rouquier ultimately proving Brou\'e's abelian defect group conjecture for symmetric groups. In this paper we show that the Morita and splendid Rickard equivalences constructed by Kleshchev and Livesey descend to the ring $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p$-adic integers, hence prove Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'e's abelian defect group conjecture for these RoCK blocks.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show the Harris--Viehmann conjecture under some Hodge--Newton reducibility condition for a generalization of the diamond of a non-basic Rapoport--Zink space at infinite level, which appears as a cover of the non-semi-stable locus in the Hecke stack. We show also that the cohomology of the non-semi-stable locus with coefficient coming from a cuspidal Langlands parameter vanishes. As an application, we show the Hecke eigensheaf property in Fargues' conjecture for cuspidal Langlands parameters in the GL(2)-case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Every word $w$ in $F_r$, the free group of rank $r$, induces a probability measure (the $w$-measure) on every finite group $G$, by substitution of random $G$-elements in the letters. This measure is determined by its Fourier coefficients: the $w$-expectations $E_w[\chi]$ of the irreducible characters of $G$. For every finite group $G$, every stable character $\chi$ of $G\wr S_n$ (trace of a finitely generated $FI_G$-module), and every word $w\in F_r$, we approximate $E_w[\chi]$ up to an error term of $O(n^{-\pi(w)})$, where $\pi(w)$ is the primitivity rank of $w$. This generalizes previous works by Puder, Hanany, Magee and the author. As an application we show that random Schreier graphs of representation-stable actions of $G\wr S_n$ are close-to-optimal expanders. The paper reveals a surprising relation between stable representation theory of wreath products and not-necessarily connected Stallings core graphs.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Suman Mondal &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Introduced by Sheekey in 2016, the study of scattered polynomials over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$ has been increasing regarding the classification of those that are exceptional, i.e., polynomials which are scattered over infinite field extensions, are limited to the cases where their index $t$ is small, or a prime number larger than the q-degree k of the polynomial, or an integer smaller than k in the case where k is a prime. In this paper, we focus on the scattered behavior of $S(x)=\sum_{i=1}^k a_ix^{q^{r_i}} \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}[x]$, where $q$ is a power of an odd prime, $0<r_1<r_2< \cdots<r_k<n$ and $a_1, \cdots,a_k \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}^*$ such that the order of $a_i$'s divide $(q^{r_1}-1)$, $\forall i=2,3,\cdots,k $. We explore a connection between $S(x)$ and the cyclotomic mapping polynomial. As an application, in three parts, we discuss the scattered behavior of $S(x)$ of index $t$ where $t=r_1$, or $0<t<r_1$, or $r_1<t<n$. Starting with the pseudoregulus type of index $t \geq 0$, we present conditions to verify scattered behavior of $S(x)$ of index $r_1$. With some additional conditions, we do the same in case $0<t<r_1$ or $r_1<t<n$. In particular, for $S(x)=a_1x^{q^{r_1}}+a_2x^{q^{r_2}} \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}[x]$ with $a_1,a_2 \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}^*$ such that $|a_2| \mid q^{r_1}-1$, we present a necessary and sufficient condition to verify its scattered behavior of index $t \in \{r_1,r_2\}$. We also connect such scattered binomials with the well known Lunardon-Polverino polynomial. With conditions on $\delta, q,n$, and $r$; we present a new family of exceptional scattered polynomial $S(x)=x^q+\delta x^{q^{(2r+1)}} \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}[x]$ of index $\{r+1\}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 19 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Generalised Temperley-Lieb categories with regions labelled by elements of a commutative algebra were introduced by M. Khovanov and the second author in [Pure Appl. Math. Q. 19 (2023), no. 5]. We consider the case where the regions are labelled by colours, corresponding to a complete set of orthogonal idempotents of a semisimple commutative algebra. We determine when these generalised Temperley-Lieb categories are semisimple and find the direct sum decompositions of tensor products of simple objects. As the main tool we introduce two-variable versions of Chebychev polynomials and construct analogues of Jones-Wenzl projectors. As a consequence, we prove a conjecture of M. Khovanov and the second author on Gram determinants and non-degeneracy of trace pairings for the associated Temperley-Lieb algebras with coloured regions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Exponential sums with monomials are highly related to many interesting problems in number theory and well studied by many literatures. In this paper, we consider the exponential sums with polynomials and prove a new upper bound. As an application, we study the Piatetski-Shapiro sequence of the form $(\lfloor n^c \rfloor)$ where $c > 1$ is not an integer. We improve the admissible range of the asymptotic formula for primes in the intersection of Piatetski-Shapiro sequences. We also study the iterated Piatetski-Shapiro sequence and prove an asymptotic formula for the prime counting function.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages. v3: Final version. To appear in Forum Mathematicum. This version improves the exposition and the results of Section 5. It also corrects several inaccuracies, in particular in Section 4. Comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E_{\lambda}$ be the Legendre family of elliptic curves with equation $Y^2=X(X-1)(X-\lambda)$. Given a curve $\mathcal{C}$, satisfying a condition on the degrees of some of its coordinates and parametrizing $m$ points $P_1, \ldots, P_m \in E_{\lambda}$ and $n$ points $Q_1, \ldots, Q_n \in E_{\mu}$ and assuming that those points are generically linearly independent over the generic endomorphism ring, we prove that there are at most finitely many points $\mathbf{c}_0$ on $\mathcal{C}$, such that there exists an isogeny $\phi: E_{\mu(\mathbf{c}_0)} \rightarrow E_{\lambda(\mathbf{c}_0)}$ and the $m+n$ points $P_1(\mathbf{c}_0), \ldots, P_m(\mathbf{c}_0), \phi(Q_1(\mathbf{c}_0)), \ldots, \phi(Q_n(\mathbf{c}_0)) \in E_{\lambda(\mathbf{c}_0)}$ are linearly dependent over $\mathrm{End}(E_{\lambda(\mathbf{c}_0)})$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** The result of this paper is mostly superseded by another paper of myself uploaded on the same day. The method presented here may still be of interest

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a $p$-adic reductive group with $p$ ``very large.'' For any irreducible admissible representation $\pi$ of $G$ over an algebraically closed field $C$ of characteristic $\not=p$, we define a ``local character expansion'' of $\pi$ with coefficients $c_{\mathcal{O}}(\pi)\in\mathbb{Q}$, that does not use the character of $\pi$ directly but instead use the multiplicities of degenerate Moy-Prasad types. Note that the existence of local character expansion for mod-$\ell$ representations is shown by another paper of the author using a different and quicker method.</p></details>

We generalize the local character expansion results of Howe, Harish-Chandra and DeBacker to such lifted characters. We show that the result of Moeglin-Waldspurger and Varma on degenerate Whittaker models is valid for the character expansion.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 38 pages. Weakened the hypothesis of potential total ramifiedness to local potential total ramifiedness together with a normal closure assumption. Included some applications to elliptic curves over number fields and abelian varieties

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An algebraic extension of the rational numbers is said to have the $\textit{Bogomolov property}$ (B) if the absolute logarithmic Weil height of its non-torsion elements is uniformly bounded from below. Given a continuous representation $\rho$ of the absolute Galois group $G_{\mathbb{K}}$ of a number field ${\mathbb{K}}$, one says that $\rho$ has (B) if the subfield of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ fixed by $\mathrm{ker}\,\rho$ has (B). We prove that, if $\rho:G_{\mathbb{K}} \to \mathrm{GL}_d({\mathbb{Z}}_p)$ maps an inertia subgroup at a prime above $p$ surjectively onto an open subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_d({\mathbb{Z}}_p)$, then $\rho$ has (B). More generally, we show that if the image of inertia is open in the image of the decomposition group, the normal closure of the local image is sufficiently large in the global one, and a certain condition on the center of $\rho(G_{\mathbb{K}})$ satisfied, then $\rho$ has (B). In particular, no assumption on the modularity of $\rho$ is needed, contrary to previous work of Habegger and Amoroso--Terracini. We provide several examples both in modular and non-modular cases. Our methods rely on a result of Sen comparing the ramification and Lie filtrations on the $p$-adic Lie group $\rho(G_{\mathbb{K}})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove two fast formulas for the Hurwitz values $\zeta(2,a)$ and $\zeta(3,a)$ respectively with the help of the WZ method. In them $(a)_n$ denotes the rising factorial or Pochhammer's symbol defined by $(a)_0=1$ and $(a)_n=a(a+1)\cdots(a+n-1)$ for positive integers $n$. The Huwitz $\zeta$ function is defined by $\zeta(s,a)=\zeta(0,s,a)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (k+a)^{-s}$. In addition, we can use these fast evaluations to compute also in a rapid way Dirichlet values of the kinds $L_{\chi}(2)$ and $L_{\chi}(3)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 44 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a 1965 paper, R. Robinson made five conjectures about the classification of cyclotomic algebraic integers for which the maximum absolute value in any complex embedding (the house) is small, modulo the equivalence relation generated by Galois conjugation and multiplication by roots of unity. In response to one of these conjectures, Cassels showed in 1969 that when the house is at most $\sqrt{5}$, one obtains three parametric families plus an effectively computable finite set of equivalence classes of exceptions. Building on the work of Jones, Calegari-Morrison-Snyder, and Robinson-Wurtz, we determine this exceptional set. By specializing to the case where the house is strictly less than 2, we resolve the final outstanding conjecture from Robinson's 1965 paper.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given an additively written abelian group $G$ and a set $X\subseteq G$, we let $\mathsf{D}(X)$ denote the Davenport constant of $X$, namely the largest non-negative integer $n$ for which there exists a sequence $x_1, \dots, x_n$ of elements of $X$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i =0$ and $\sum_{i \in I} x_i \ne 0$ for each non-empty proper subset $I$ of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$. In this paper, we mainly investigate the case when $G$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $\mathbb{Z}^3$, and $X$ is a discrete Euclidean ball. An application to the classical problem of estimating the Davenport constant of a box - a product of intervals of integers - is then obtained.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 244 pages, many figures. V2: 246 pages, added references and minor changes

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A noncommutative (NC) version of Poisson geometry was initiated by Van den Bergh by introducing at the level of associative algebras the formalism of double Poisson brackets. Their key property is to induce (standard) Poisson brackets under each representation functor. Then, Pichereau and Van de Weyer developed and studied the corresponding cohomology theory under the assumption that there exists a NC bivector defining the double Poisson bracket. Our first main result is that one can remove this assumption by constructing a completed double Poisson cohomology valid in any situation, hence generalizing the approach of Pichereau-Van de Weyer. As an application, we show that the double Poisson cohomology complex associated to the path algebra of a quiver is acyclic. Furthermore, we show that this new double Poisson cohomology theory can be adapted to weaker forms of double Poisson brackets (called quasi-Poisson and gauged Poisson), and that it is compatible with representation functors. A second focus of this memoir concerns the formalism of double Poisson vertex algebras. These were introduced by De Sole, Kac and the second author, as NC versions of Poisson vertex algebras, which induce the latter structures under each representation functor. Our second main result is the development of cohomology theories for double Poisson vertex algebras. These are NC analogues of the basic, reduced and variational Poisson vertex algebra cohomologies. More importantly, we prove that under each representation functor these cohomology theories are compatible with their commutative counterparts. As an application, we compute the double Poisson vertex algebra cohomology of the generalized NC de Rham complex and of the generalized NC variational complex. Finally, we describe the relation between the double Poisson algebra and double Poisson vertex algebra cohomologies using jet and quotient functors.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a torsion pair $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$ in an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ and its Happel-Reiten-Smal{\o} tilt $\mathcal{B}$, the equivalence of the realization functor $D^b({\mathcal B})\to D^b({\mathcal A})$ is determined by some properties of the torsion pair [9]. We call $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$ satisfying such a property effaceable. If $\mathcal{A}$ is an Ext-finite abelian category with Serre duality, we prove that $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$ is effaceable implies that $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal T}$ is closed under Serre functor. Conversely, when $\mathcal A$ is the module category of a finite-dimensional hereditary algebra, we prove that the torsion pair $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$ is effaceable if and only if $\mathcal{U}_\mathcal{T}$ is closed under the Serre functor via a recollement of $D^b({\mathcal A})$.</p></details>

Applying to the generalized $(d-2)$-cluster categories associated to this quiver with superpotential, we prove that some certain almost complete $(d-2)$-cluster tilting objects in the higher cluster category have exactly $d-1$ complements.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f$ be a real-valued $1$-bounded multiplicative function. Suppose that the mean-value of $f^{2}$ exists, and $$\int_{0}^{1} \Big | \sum_{n \leq N} f(n)e^{2\pi i n \alpha} \Big | d \alpha\leq N^{o(1)}$$ as $N \rightarrow \infty$, then there exists a quadratic character $\chi$ such that for every $\delta > 0$ the (logarithmic) proportion of primes $p \leq N$ such that $|f(p) - \chi(p)| < \delta$ tends to $1$ as $N \rightarrow \infty$. More generally we show that for all $N, \Delta \geq 1$ and $1$-bounded multiplicative functions $f$, if $$\int_{0}^{1} \Big | \sum_{n \leq N} f(n) e^{2\pi i n \alpha} \Big | d \alpha \leq \Delta$$ and the $L^{2}$ norm of $f$ over $[1, N]$ is $\geq N / 100$, then $f$ pretends to be a multiplicative character of conductor $\leq \Delta^{2}$ on primes in $[\Delta^{2}, N]$. We highlight that the result is uniform in $f$, $N$ and $\Delta$ and sharp as far as the size of the conductor goes.

> **Comment:** Changed "free" descriptions to "dimension-free" ones. Added clarifications and minor fixes

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Convex sets arising in a variety of applications are well-defined for every relevant dimension. Examples include the simplex and the spectraplex that correspond to probability distributions and to quantum states; combinatorial polytopes and their relaxations such as the cut polytope and the elliptope in integer programming; and unit balls of regularizers such as the $\ell_p$ and Schatten norms in inverse problems. Moreover, these sets are often specified using conic descriptions that can be obviously instantiated in any dimension. We develop a systematic framework to study such dimension-free descriptions of convex sets. We show that dimension-free descriptions arise from a recently-identified phenomenon in algebraic topology called representation stability, which relates invariants across dimensions in a sequence of group representations. Our framework yields structural results for dimension-free descriptions pertaining to the relations between the sets they describe across dimensions, extendability of a single set in a given dimension to a freely-described sequence, and continuous limits of such sequences. We also develop a procedure to obtain parametric families of freely-described convex sets whose structure is adapted to a given application; illustrations are provided via examples that arise in the literature as well as new families that are derived using our procedure. We demonstrate the utility of our framework in two contexts. First, we develop an algorithm for a dimension-free analog of the convex regression problem, where a convex function is fit to input-output data; by searching over our parametric families, we can fit a function to low-dimensional inputs and extend it to any other dimension. Second, we prove that many sequences of symmetric conic programs can be solved in constant time, which unifies and strengthens several results in the literature.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Mahler's problem asks for the largest possible value of the Mahler measure, normalized by the $L_2$ norm, of a polynomial with $\pm1$ coefficients and large degree. We establish a new record value in this problem exceeding $0.95$ by analyzing certain Turyn polynomials, which are defined by cyclically shifting the coefficients of a Fekete polynomial by a prescribed amount. It was recently established that the distribution of values over the unit circle of Fekete polynomials of large degree is effectively modeled by a particular random point process. We extend this analysis to the Turyn polynomials, and determine expressions for the asymptotic normalized Mahler measure of these polynomials, as well as for their normalized $L_q$ norms. We also describe a number of calculations on the corresponding random processes, which indicate that the Turyn polynomials where the shift is approximately $1/4$ of the length have Mahler measure exceeding $95\%$ of their $L_2$ norm. Further, we show that these asymptotic values are not disturbed by a small change to make polynomials having entirely $\pm1$ coefficients, which establishes the result on Mahler's problem. We also estimate that the limiting value of the normalized $L_1$ norm of these polynomials exceeds $0.977$, in connection with a question of Newman.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Ruzsa's inequality states that $|A+A+A| \leq |A+A|^{3/2}$ for any finite set $A$ in a commutative group. Ruzsa has constructed examples showing that this inequality is sharp asymptotically, up to a constant factor. We prove an inverse result which says that if $|A+A+A| \geq \frac{1}{M} |A+A|^{3/2}$ for some parameter $M,$ then the set $A$ resembles the sets in Ruzsa's construction. We then construct more families of examples which suggest that our inverse result is likely best possible qualitatively. The method extends to give an inverse result for a higher sumset analogue of Ruzsa's inequality, namely $|(h+1)A| \leq |hA|^{\frac{h+1}{h}}$ for any $h\geq 2.$ We also provide a "99%-stability" version of Ruzsa's inequality, which describes near optimal structures when $M$ is very close to $1.$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p > 0$ and let $\ell$ be a prime number different from $p$. Let $U \subseteq G$ be a maximal unipotent subgroup, $T$ a maximal torus normalizing $U$ and $W$ the Weyl group of $G$. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a non-degenerate multiplicative $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\ell} $-local system on $U$. R. Bezrukavnikov and the second author have proved that the bi-Whittaker category, namely the triangulated monoidal category of $(U, \mathcal{L})$-biequivariant $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\ell}$-complexes on $G$ is monoidally equivalent to an explicit thick triangulated monoidal subcategory $\mathscr{D}_{W}^{\circ}(T) \subseteq \mathscr{D}_{W}(T)$ of "central sheaves" on the torus. In particular it has the structure of a symmetric monoidal category coming from the symmetric monoidal structure on $\mathscr{D}_W(T)$. In this paper, we give another construction of a symmetric monoidal structure on the above category and prove that it agrees with the one coming from the above construction. For this, among other things, we generalize a proof by Gelfand for finite groups to the geometric setup.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define an $f$-restricted partition $p_f(n,k)$ of fixed length $k$ given by the bivariate generating series \begin{align*} Q_f(z,u) \coloneqq 1+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} p_f(n,k) u^kz^n =\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}(1+uz^k)^{\Delta_f(k)}, \end{align*} where $\Delta_f(n)=f(n+1)-f(n)$. In this article, we establish a central limit theorem for the number of summands in such partitions when $f(n)=\sigma_r(n)$ denotes the generalised divisor function, defined as $\sigma_r(n)=\sum_{d|n}d^r$ for integer $r\geq 2$. This can be considered as a generalisation of the work of Lipnik, Madritsch, and Tichy, who previously studied this problem for $f(n)=\lfloor{n}^{\alpha}\rfloor$ with $0<\alpha<1$. A key element of our proof relies on the analytic behaviour of the Dirichlet series \begin{align*} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sigma_r(n+1)}{n^s}, \end{align*} for $\mathrm{Re}(s)>1$. We study this problem employing the identity involving the Ramanujan sum. Furthermore, we analyse the Euler product arising from the above Dirichlet series by adopting the argument of Alkan, Ledoan and Zaharescu.</p></details>

Furthermore, we study the asymptotic behaviour of weighted sums of Hurwitz class numbers that appear in the moment formula.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Snake graphs are a class of planar graphs that are important in the theory of cluster algebras. Indeed, the Laurent expansions of the cluster variables in cluster algebras from surfaces are given as weight generating functions for 1-dimer covers (or perfect matchings) of snake graphs. Moreover, the enumeration of 1-dimer covers of snake graphs provides a combinatorial interpretation of continued fractions. In particular, the number of 1-dimer covers of the snake graph $\mathscr{G}[a_1,\dots,a_n]$ is the numerator of the continued fraction $[a_1,\dots,a_n]$. This number is equal to the top left entry of the matrix product $\left(\begin{smallmatrix} a_1&1\\1&0 \end{smallmatrix}\right) \cdots \left(\begin{smallmatrix} a_n&1\\1&0 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$. In this paper, we give enumerative results on $m$-dimer covers of snake graphs. We show that the number of $m$-dimer covers of the snake graph $\mathscr{G}[a_1,\ldots,a_n]$ is the top left entry of a product of analogous $(m+1)$-by-$(m+1)$ matrices. We discuss how our enumerative results are related to other known combinatorial formulas, and we suggest a generalization of continued fractions based on our methods. These generalized continued fractions provide some interesting open questions and a possibly novel approach towards Hermite's problem for cubic irrationals.</p></details>

One particularly promising field is quantitative finance, where a central challenge is the pricing of financial derivatives-traditionally addressed through Monte Carlo integration techniques. In this work, we introduce two hybrid classical-quantum methods to address the option pricing problem. These approaches rely on reconstructing Fourier series representations of statistical distributions from the outputs of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models based on Parametrized Quantum Circuits (PQCs). We analyze the impact of data size and PQC dimensionality on performance. Quantum Accelerated Monte Carlo (QAMC) is employed as a benchmark to quantitatively assess the proposed models in terms of computational cost and accuracy in the extraction of Fourier coefficients. Through the numerical experiments, we show that the proposed methods achieve remarkable accuracy, becoming a competitive quantum alternative for derivatives valuation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct an action of the braid group on the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on hypertoric varieties arising from hyperplane arrangements. Using wall-crossing equivalences associated to paths in the complexified complement of the hyperplane arrangement, we show that these equivalences under certain conditions yield a functor from the Deligne groupoid to the category of triangulated equivalences. This gives rise to a canonical representation of the fundamental group, which recovers the braid group, acting on $D^b(\mathfrak{M}_{\eta})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the rank-4 case of the conjecture of Ha-Hai-Nghia for the invariant subspace of the truncated polynomial ring $\mathcal{Q}_m(n)=\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dots,x_n]/(x_1^{q^m},\dots,x_n^{q^m}),$ under a new, explicit technical hypothesis. Our argument extends the determinant calculus for the delta operator by deriving crucial rank-4 identities governing its interaction with the Dickson algebra. We show that the proof of the conjecture reduces to a specific vanishing property, for which we introduce a sufficient condition, the "matching hypothesis" ($\mathrm{H_{match}}$), relating the degree structures of Dickson invariants. This condition is justified by theoretical arguments and verified computationally in many cases. Combining this approach with the normalized derivation approach from our prior work, we establish the conjecture. As a result, the Lewis-Reiner-Stanton Conjecture is also confirmed for rank four under the given hypothesis.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is the first of a pair of papers, whose collective goal is to disprove a conjecture of Kemarsky, Paulin, and Shapira (KPS) on the escape of mass of Laurent series. This paper lays the foundations on which its sibling builds. In particular, the $p$-Cantor sequence is introduced. This generalises the classical Cantor sequence into a $p$-automatic sequence for any odd prime $p$. Two main results are then established, both of which play a key role in the disproof of the KPS conjecture. First, the two-dimensional sequence comprised of the Toeplitz determinants of the $p$-Cantor sequence over $\mathbb{F}_p$ is extensively studied. Indeed, the so-called profile of this sequence (which encodes the zero regions) is shown to be [p,p]-automatic. In the process of deriving this, the theory of so-called number walls is developed greatly. Many of these results are stated in full generality, as the authors expect them to be useful when tackling similar problems going forward. Secondly, a natural process is described that converts number wall of an automatic sequence into a unique fractal. When this sequence is the aforementioned $p$-Cantor sequence, this fractal is shown to have Hausdorff dimension $\log((p^2+1)/2)/\log(p).$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime. In 2017, Kemarsky, Paulin, and Shapira (KPS) conjectured that any Laurent series over $\mathbb{F}_p$ exhibits full escape of mass with respect to any irreducible polynomial $P(t)\in\mathbb{F}_p[t]$. In 2025, this was shown to be false in the case $p=2$ and $P(t)=t$ by Nesharim, Shapira and the first named author. This work shows that for any odd prime $p$ and any irreducible polynomial $P(t)\in\mathbb{F}_p[t]$, the so-called $p$-Cantor sequence provides a counterexample to the aforementioned conjecture over $\mathbb{F}_p$. Furthermore, the concepts of maximal escape of mass and generic escape of mass are introduced. These lead to two natural variations of the KPS conjecture, both of which are shown to hold for all previous counterexamples.</p></details>

In addition, we prove some results characterizing the shape of the generating series of numerical functions which are quasi-polynomials in $p^n$. This is motivated by the fact that the Hilbert-Kunz and F-signature functions take this form in several examples of interest.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The seminal paper "J.T. Stafford, Module structure of Weyl algebras, J. London Math. Soc. (2) 18 (1978), no. 3, 429--442" was a major step forward in our understanding of Weyl algebras. Beginning with Serre's Theorem on free summands of projective modules and Bass' Stable Range Theorem in commutative algebra, we attempt to trace the origins of this work and explain how it led to Stafford's construction of non-holonomic simple modules over Weyl algebras. We also describe Bernstein-Lunt's geometric construction of infinite families of non-holonomic simple modules. We recall more recent developments related to Weyl algebras, especially that of parametrizing right ideals in the first Weyl algebra and its relation to Calogero-Moser spaces. Finally, we revisit Stafford's results in the context of quantized symplectic singularities, where they lead naturally to open problems on the behaviour of simple modules.</p></details>

Furthermore, we establish that Wach modules of Berger naturally descend over to a smaller period ring studied by Fontaine and Wach. This enables us to define another syntomic complex with coefficients, and we show that its cohomology also computes the crystalline part of the Galois cohomology of the associated representation.</p></details>

Our approach also applies more generally to quotients of rings of finite left global dimension by a regular central element. It utilises a construction of Shamash, combined with the iterated mapping cone technique, to systematically `purge' homology from a complex. We demonstrate the computability of our method through explicit calculations for several families of groups including hyperbolic triangle groups and mapping class groups of the punctured plane.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A conjecture by Sun states that the partition function $p(n)$, for $n>1$, is never a perfect power. Recent work by Merca et al. proposes generalizations of perfect-power repulsion for $p(n)$. In this note, we prove these generalizations for the functions $p_B(n)$, which count the number of partitions of $n$ with the largest part $\leq B$. If $B\geq 4$ and $k\geq 3$, with $k\nmid (B-1)$, then we prove that there are only finitely many pairs $(n,m)$ for which $$\lvert p_B(n)-m^k\rvert\le d.$$ These results support Sun and Merca et al.'s conjectures, as $p_B(n) \rightarrow p(n)$ when $B \rightarrow +\infty.$ To prove this, we reduce the problem to Siegel's Theorem, which guarantees the finiteness of integral points on curves with genus $\geq 1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Zeckendorf's Theorem says that for all $k \geq 3$, every nonnegative integer has a unique $k$-Zeckendorf representation as a sum of distinct $k$-bonacci numbers, where no $k$ consecutive $k$-bonacci numbers are present in the representation. Anderson and Bicknell-Johnson extend this result to the multidimensional context: letting the $k$-bonacci vectors $\vec{\mathbf{X}}_i \in \mathbb{Z}^{k-1}$ be given by $\vec{\mathbf{X}}_0=\vec{\mathbf{0}}$, $\vec{\mathbf{X}}_{-i}=\vec{\mathbf{e}}_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq k-1$, and $\vec{\mathbf{X}}_n=\sum_{i=1}^k \vec{\mathbf{X}}_{n-i}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, they show that for all $k \geq 3$, every $\vec{\mathbf{v}} \in \mathbb{Z}^{k-1}$ has a unique $k$-bonacci vector Zeckendorf representation, a sum of distinct $k$-bonacci vectors where no $k$ consecutive $k$-bonacci vectors are present in the representation. Their proof provides an inductive algorithm for finding such representations. We present two improved algorithms for finding the $k$-bonacci vector Zeckendorf representation of $\vec{\mathbf{v}}$ and analyze their relative efficiency. We utilize a projection map $S_n:\mathbb Z^{k-1} \to \mathbb Z_{\geq 0}$, introduced in Anderson and Bicknell-Johnson work, that reduces the study of $k$-bonacci vector representations to the setting of $k$-bonacci number representations, provided a lower bound is established for the most negatively indexed $k$-bonacci vector present in the $k$-bonacci vector Zeckendorf representation of $\vec{\mathbf{v}}$. Using this map and a bijection between $\mathbb Z^{k-1}$ and $\mathbb Z_{\geq 0}$, we further show that the number of and gaps between summands in $k$-bonacci vector Zeckendorf representations exhibit the same properties as those in $k$-Zeckendorf representations and that $k$-bonacci vector Zeckendorf representations exhibit summand minimality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present an algorithm that, for every fixed degree $n\ge 3$, will enumerate all degree-$n$ places of the projective line over a finite field $k$ up to the natural action of $\mathrm{PGL}_2(k)$ using $O(\log q)$ space and $\widetilde{O}(q^{n-3})$ time, where $q=\#k$. Since there are $\Theta(q^{n-3})$orbits of $\mathrm{PGL}_2(k)$ acting on the set of degree-$n$ places, the algorithm is quasilinear in the size of its output. The algorithm is probabilistic unless we assume the extended Riemann hypothesis. We also present an algorithm for enumerating orbit representatives for the action of $\mathrm{PGL}_2(k)$ on the degree-$n$ effective divisors of $\mathbf{P}^1$ over finite fields $k$. The two algorithms depend on one another; our method of enumerating orbits of places of odd degree $n$ depends on enumerating orbits of effective divisors of degree $(n+1)/2$. As an application of the second algorithm, for $g=2$, $3$, and $4$ we implement an algorithm in Magma that computes all hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ over finite fields $k$ using $O(q^{g-1})$ space and $\widetilde{O}(q^{2g-1})$ time, where $q=\#k$. Our implementation runs $60$--$80$ times faster than existing algorithms for computing genus-$2$ hyperelliptic curves, and about $280$ times faster than existing algorithms for computing genus-$3$ hyperelliptic curves. We know of no other implementations of algorithms to compute genus-$4$ hyperelliptic curves.</p></details>

The main condition that $\mu$ must satisfy is of Fourier-theoretic nature, and holds for example when $\mu$ is the uniform measure on a set of at least $35$ consecutive integers, or on an arbitrary, sufficiently large subset of an interval $[-H,H]$, with $H$ larger than some absolute constant. Our most general result allows for each $a_j$ to be sampled by its own probability measure $\mu_j$. Our approach builds on earlier work of Bary-Soroker, Kozma and the second author, who proved for essentially the same $\mu_j$ that the 'standard' monic polynomial $a_0 + \cdots + a_{m-1}T^{m-1} + T^m$ is irreducible and has as Galois group either the symmetric group $\mathcal{S}_m$ or the alternating group $\mathcal{A}_m$ with high probability, conditioning on $a_0 \neq 0$. In our setting of reciprocal polynomials, we can rule out (all subgroups of) the maximal alternating subgroup $(\mathcal{C}_2 \wr \mathcal{S}_m) \cap \mathcal{A}_{2m}$ of the hyperoctahedral group as likely Galois group of $A$ by analyzing its discriminant.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any set $A$ of natural numbers with positive upper Banach density, we show the existence of an infinite set $B$ and sequences $(t_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}, (s_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ of natural numbers such that $\left\{ \sum_{n \in F}n : F \subset B + s_k, 1 \leq |F| \leq k \right\}\subset A-t_k$, for every $k\in \mathbb{N}$. This strengthens the density finite sums theorem of Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson. We further show, given such a set $A$, the existence of an infinite set $B$ and a sequence $(t_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ of natural numbers such that $\left\{ \sum_{n \in F}n : F \subset B, |F| = k \right\}\subset A-t_k$, for every $k\in \mathbb{N}$. As a corollary, we obtain a sequence $(B_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ of infinite sets of natural numbers such that $B_1+\cdots +B_k \subset A$, for every $k\in \mathbb{N}$. We also establish the optimality of our main theorems by providing counterexamples to potential further generalizations, and thereby addressing questions of the aforementioned authors in the context of density analogs to Hindman's finite sums theorem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work we classify the thick subcategories of the bounded derived category of dg modules over a Koszul complex on any list of elements in a regular ring. This simultaneously recovers a theorem of Stevenson when the list of elements is a regular sequence and the classification of thick subcategories for an exterior algebra over a field (via the BGG correspondence). One of the major ingredients is a classification of thick tensor submodules of perfect curved dg modules over a commutative noetherian graded ring concentrated in even degrees, recovering a theorem of Hopkins and Neeman. We give several consequences of the classification result over a Koszul complex, one being that the lattice of thick subcategories of the bounded derived category is fixed by Grothendieck duality.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Added Sections 5.1 and 5.2 on failure of log-concavity in other Lie types and for Jack/Macdonald polynomials. Added Appendix A, exploring the log-concavity of arbitrary simple highest weight characters in type A

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2022, Huh-Matherne-M\'esz\'aros-St. Dizier showed that normalized Schur polynomials are Lorentzian, thereby yielding their continuous (resp. discrete) log-concavity on the positive orthant (resp. on their support, in type $A$ root directions). A reinterpretation of this result is that the characters of finite-dimensional simple representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ are denormalized Lorentzian (DL). In the same paper, these authors also showed that shifted characters of Verma modules over $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ are DL. In this work we extend these results to a larger family of modules that subsumes both of the above: we show that shifted characters of all parabolic Verma modules over $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ are denormalized Lorentzian. The proof involves certain graphs on $[n+1]$; more strongly, we explain why the character (i.e., generating function) of the Kostant partition function of any loopless multigraph on $[n+1]$ is Lorentzian after shifting and normalizing. We then show that parabolic Vermas form a "maximal" class with log-concave (hence DL) characters. Namely, log-concavity fails in greater generality along three natural directions: (1) it does not hold for every simple Lie type, (2) nor for a larger universal family of highest weight modules, the higher order Verma modules, even in type $A$, and (3) it does not always hold for important generalizations of Schur polynomials: the Jack and Macdonald polynomials. Finally, we extend these results to parabolic (i.e. "first order") and higher order Verma modules over the semisimple Lie algebras $\oplus_{t=1}^T \mathfrak{sl}_{n_t+1}(\mathbb{C})$. We also partially resolve a conjecture of Huh et al on the DL property for integral highest weight simple modules.</p></details>

> **Comment:** corrected proof of theorem 1

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a practical method to compute the 2-torsion subgroup of the Jacobian of a non-hyperelliptic curve of genus $3$, $4$ or $5$. The method is based on the correspondence between the 2-torsion subgroup and the theta hyperplanes to the curve. The correspondence is used to explicitly write down a zero-dimensional scheme whose points correspond to elements of the $2$-torsion subgroup. Using $p$-adic or complex approximations (obtained via Hensel lifting or homotopy continuation and Newton-Raphson) and lattice reduction we are then able to determine the points of our zero-dimensional scheme and hence the $2$-torsion points. We demonstrate the practicality of our method by computing the $2$-torsion of the modular Jacobians $J_{0}\left( N \right)$ for $N = 42, 55, 63, 72, 75$. As a result of this we are able to verify the generalised Ogg conjecture for these values.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f(X)$ be a nonconstant polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, with a nonzero constant term. The order of $f(X)$ is a classical notion in the theory of polynomials over finite fields, and recently the definition of freeness of binomials of $f(X)$ was given in \cite{Mart\'{i}nez}. Generalizing these two notions, we introduce the definition of the minimal binomial multiple of $f(X)$ in this paper, which is the monic binomial with the lowest degree among the binomials over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ divided by $f(X)$. Based on the equivalent characterization of binomials via the defining sets of their radicals, we prove that a series of properties of the classical order can be naturally generalized to this case. In particular, the minimal binomial multiple of $f(X)$ is presented explicitly in terms of the defining set of the radical of $f(X)$. And a criterion for $f(X)$ being free of binomials is given. As an application, for any positive integer $N$ and nonzero element $\lambda$ in $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, the $\lambda$-constacyclic codes of length $N$ with minimal distance $2$ are determined.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A much-studied problem posed by Motzkin asks to determine, given a finite set $D$ of integers, the so-called Motzkin density for $D$, i.e., the supremum of upper densities of sets of integers whose difference set avoids $D$. We study the natural analogue of this problem in compact abelian groups. Using ergodic-theoretic tools, this is shown to be equivalent to the following discrete problem: given a lattice $\Lambda\subset \mathbb{Z}^r$, letting $D$ be the image in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$ of the standard basis, determine the Motzkin density for $D$ in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$. We study in particular the periodicity question: is there a periodic $D$-avoiding set of maximal density in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$? The Greenfeld--Tao counterexample to the periodic tiling conjecture implies that the answer can be negative. On the other hand, we prove that the answer is positive in several cases, including the case rank$(\Lambda)=1$ (in which we give a formula for the Motzkin density), the case rank$(\Lambda)=r-1$, and hence also the case $r\leq 3$. It follows that, for up to three missing differences, the Motzkin density in a compact abelian group is always a rational number.</p></details>

In this paper, we introduce a new concept of a generalized triangulation quiver, extending the notion of a triangulation quiver. Inparticular, it is also shown that the generalized triangulation quivers can be constructed from triangulations of orientable surfaces with marked self-foldedtriangles.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study a quantitative notion of exactness within Diophantine approximation. Given $\Psi:(0,\infty)\to (0,\infty)$ and $\omega:(0,\infty)\to (0,1)$ satisfying $\lim_{q\to\infty}\omega(q)=0$, we study the set of points, which we call $E(\Psi,\omega)$, that are $\Psi$-well approximable but not $\Psi(1-\omega)$-well approximable. We prove results on the cardinality and dimension of $E(\Psi,\omega)$. In particular we obtain the following general statements: (i) For any $\omega:(0,\infty)\to (0,1)$ and $\tau>2$ there exists $\Psi:(0,\infty)\to (0,\infty)$ such that $\lim_{q\to\infty}\frac{-\log \Psi(q)}{\log q}=\tau$ and $E(\Psi,\omega)\neq\emptyset.$ (ii) Under natural monotonicity assumptions on $\Psi$ and $\omega,$ we prove that if $\omega$ decays to zero sufficiently slowly (in a way that depends upon $\Psi$) then $E(\Psi,\omega)$ is uncountable. Moreover, under further natural assumptions on $\Psi$ we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension of $E(\Psi,\omega)$. Our main result demonstrates a new threshold for the behaviour of $E(\Psi,\omega)$. A particular instance of this threshold is illustrated by considering functions of the form $\Psi_{\tau}(q)=q^{-\tau}$ when $\tau\in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 3}$. For these functions we prove the following: (iii) If $\omega(q)= Cq^{-\tau(\tau-1)}$ for some sufficiently large $C$ or $\omega(q)=q^{-\tau'}$ for some $\tau'<\tau(\tau-1),$ then $E(\Psi_{\tau},\omega)$ is uncountable and we calculate its Hausdorff dimension. (iv) If $\omega(q)< cq^{-\tau(\tau-1)}$ for some $c\in (0,1)$ for all $q$ sufficiently large then $E(\Psi_{\tau},\omega)=\emptyset.$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the generalized character $\Psi_{1,p,G}$ of a finite group $G$ which vanishes on all $p$-singular elements of $G$ and whose value at each $p$-regular $y \in G$ is the number of $p$-elements of $C_{G}(y)$. We conjecture that this is always a character, and may be afforded by a projective $RG$-module, where $R$ is an appropriate complete discrete valuation ring whose residue field has characteristic $p$. We examine a number of case where this is the case, and consider consequences for the representation theory and character theory of $G$ when this conjecture is known to hold. In particular, we prove, among other things, that the conjecture is valid for all primes $p$ in the case that $G \cong {\rm PSL}(2,q)$ or ${\rm SL}(2,q)$ for every prime power $q$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra, $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ its quantum group, and $U_q(\mathfrak{k}) \subset U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ a quantum symmetric pair subalgebra determined by a Lie algebra automorphism $\theta$. We introduce a category $W_\theta$ of weight $U_q(\mathfrak{k})$-modules, which is acted on by the category of weight $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-modules via tensor products. We construct a universal tensor K-matrix $\mathbb{K}$ (that is, a solution of a reflection equation) in a completion of $U_q(\mathfrak{k}) \otimes U_q(\mathfrak{g})$. This yields a natural operator on any tensor product $M \otimes V$, where $M\in W_\theta$ and $V\in {O}_\theta$, that is $V$ is a $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-module in category ${O}$ satisfying an integrability property determined by $\theta$. Canonically, $W_\theta$ is equipped with a structure of a bimodule category over ${O}_\theta$ and the action of $\mathbb{K}$ is encoded by a new categorical structure, which we call a boundary structure on $W_\theta$. This generalizes a result of Kolb which describes a braided module structure on finite-dimensional $U_q(\mathfrak{k})$-modules when $\mathfrak{g}$ is finite-dimensional. We also consider our construction in the case of the category ${C}$ of finite-dimensional modules over a quantum affine algebra, providing the most comprehensive universal framework to date for large families of solutions of parameter-dependent reflection equations. In this case the tensor K-matrix gives rise to a formal Laurent series with a well-defined action on tensor products of any module in $W_\theta$ and any module in ${C}$. This series can be normalized to an operator-valued rational function, which we call trigonometric tensor K-matrix, if both factors in the tensor product are in ${C}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This short note studies the asymptotic behavior of a generating function associated with the decimal expansion of \(2^n\). Our aims are twofold: (i) to present a problem on the best possible upper bound for this behavior, and (ii) to introduce a matrix representation that is useful for its analysis. The representation corresponds to a finite-state transfer operator; analytic and dynamical aspects are not pursued here.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a complex simple Lie algebra and $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$ the corresponding quantum affine algebra. We prove that every irreducible finite-dimensional $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$-module gives rise to a family of trigonometric solutions of Cherednik's generalized reflection equation. These depend upon the choice of a quantum affine symmetric pair $U_q(\mathfrak{k})\subset U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$. Our result relies on the construction of universal K-matrices for arbitrary quantum symmetric pairs, obtained in our previous work, as well as the fact that every irreducible $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$-module is generically irreducible under restriction to $U_q({\mathfrak{k}})$. In the case of small modules and Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules, we obtain new solutions of the standard and the transposed reflection equations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of a cylindrical bialgebra, which is a quasitriangular bialgebra $H$ endowed with a universal K-matrix, i.e., a universal solution of a generalized reflection equation, yielding an action of cylindrical braid groups on tensor products of its representations. We prove that new examples of such universal K-matrices arise from quantum symmetric pairs of Kac-Moody type and depend upon the choice of a pair of generalized Satake diagrams. In finite type, this yields a refinement of a result obtained by Balagovi\'c and Kolb, producing a family of non-equivalent solutions interpolating between the quasi-K-matrix originally due to Bao and Wang and the full universal K-matrix. Finally, we prove that this construction yields formal solutions of the generalized reflection equation with a spectral parameter in the case of finite-dimensional representations over the quantum affine algebra $U_qL\mathfrak{sl}_2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Moret\'o and Rizo proposed a conjecture, known as the Picky Conjecture, proposing new character correspondences extending the McKay Conjecture. We prove the Picky Conjecture for all quasi-simple groups of Lie type for non-defining primes. In favourable situations, we also obtain the stronger version postulating preservation of character values up to sign, and we show this stronger version holds in general when assuming certain natural properties of Lusztig's Jordan decomposition. Along the way, we complete the determination of semisimple picky elements in these groups by classifying picky 2- and 3-elements.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 56 pages. In v2, the arguments in Section 3 are completely revised from those in v1, and the title is also slightly changed

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the truncated symbol $\mathrm{Symb}_0(\mathbb{D})$ of a differential symmetry breaking operator $\mathbb{D}$ between parabolically induced representations. This generalizes the symbol map $\mathrm{Symb}$, which is defined for the case of abelian nilpotent radicals, to the non-abelian setting. The inverse $\mathrm{Symb}_0^{-1}$ of the truncated symbol map $\mathrm{Symb}_0$ enables one to apply a recipe of the F-method for any nilpotent radical. As an application, we classify and construct differential intertwining operators $\mathcal{D}$ on the full flag variety $SL(3,\mathbb{R})/B$ and homomorphisms $\varphi$ between Verma modules. It turned out that, surprisingly, Cayley continuants $\mathrm{Cay}_m(x;y)$ appeared in the coefficients of one of the five families of operators that we constructed. At the end, the factorization identities of the differential operators $\mathcal{D}$ and homomorphisms $\varphi$ are also classified. Binary Krawtchouk polynomials $K_m(x;y)$ play a key role in the proof.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We address the question of effectivity for calculation of local Weil functions from the viewpoint of presentations of Cartier divisors. This builds on the approach of Bombieri and Gubler as well as the perspective of our earlier works. Among other features, our approach here gives rise to theoretical effective algorithms for calculating local Weil functions on projective varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a finite abelian group $G$ and a subset $J\subset G$ with $0\in J$, let $D_{G}(J,N)$ be the maximum size of $A\subset G^{N}$ such that the difference set $A-A$ and $J^{N}$ have no non-trivial intersection. Recently, this extremal problem has been widely studied for different groups $G$ and subsets $J$. In this paper, we generalize and improve the relevant results by Alon and by Heged\H{u}s by building a bridge between this problem and cyclotomic polynomials with the help of algebraic graph theory. In particular, we construct infinitely many non-trivial families of $G$ and $J$ for which the current known upper bounds on $D_{G}(J, N)$ can be improved exponentially.</p></details>
