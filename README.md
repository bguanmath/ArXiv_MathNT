<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a reductive algebraic group defined over a non-Archimedean local field $F$ of residue characteristic $p$. Let $\sigma$ be an automorphism of $G$ of order $\ell$ -- a prime number -- with $\ell\neq p$. Let $\Pi$ be a finite length $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell$-representation of $G(F)\rtimes \langle\sigma\rangle$. We show that the Tate cohomology $\widehat{H}^i(\langle\sigma\rangle, \Pi)$ is a finite length representation of $G^\sigma(F)$. We give an application to genericity of these Tate cohomology spaces.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Olivier Brunat, Rishi Nath &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The study of modular representation theory of the double covering groups of the symmetric and alternating groups reveals rich and subtle combinatorial and algebraic phenomena involving their irreducible characters and the structure of their p-blocks, where p is an odd prime number. In this paper, we investigate the action of certain Galois automorphisms, those that act on p'-roots of unity by a power of p, on spin characters, with an emphasis on their interaction with perfect isometries and block theory. In particular, we prove that perfect isometries constructed by the first author and J.\,B. Gramain in \cite{BrGr3}, which were used to establish a weaker form of the Kessar--Schaps conjecture, remain preserved under this Galois action whenever certain natural compatibility conditions occur.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a doubly-weighted vertical Sato-Tate law for GL(4) with explicit error terms. The main ingredient is an extension of the orthogonality relation for Maass cusp forms on GL(4) of Goldfeld, Stade, and Woodbury from spherical to general forms, and without their assumption of the Ramanujan conjecture for the error term.</p></details>

In particular, we uncover further poles of these functions and determine a natural boundary for their meromorphic continuation beyond their abscissa of convergence. We analyse both the number field and function field case.</p></details>

We then apply our methods to find that a positive proportion of curves in our family satisfy the integral Hasse principle.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a locally compact non-Archimedean field of characteristic $0$, and let $G$ be either the split special orthogonal group $\mathrm{SO}_{2n+1}(F)$ or the symplectic group $\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(F)$. The goal of this paper is to give an explicit description of the Aubert-Zelevinsky duality for $G$ in terms of Langlands parameters. We present a new algorithm, inspired by the Moeglin-Waldspurger algorithm for $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$, which computes the dual Langlands data in a recursive and combinatorial way. Our method is simple enough to be carried out by hand and provides a practical tool for explicit computations. Interestingly, the algorithm was discovered with the help of machine learning tools, guiding us toward patterns that led to its formulation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $q$ be a Pisot or Salem number. Let $f_j(x)$ $(j=1,2,\dots)$ be integer-valued polynomials of degree $\ge2$ with positive leading coefficients, and let $\{a_j (n)\}_{n\ge1}$ $(j=1,2,\dots)$ be sequences of algebraic integers in the field $\mathbb{Q}(q)$ with suitable growth conditions. In this paper, we investigate linear independence over $\mathbb{Q}(q)$ of the numbers \begin{equation*} 1,\qquad \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_j (n)}{q^{f_j (n)}} \quad (j=1,2,\dots). \end{equation*} In particular, when $a_j(n)$ $(j=1,2,\dots)$ are polynomials of $n$, we give a linear independence criterion for the above numbers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 24 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Rooted trees are essential for describing numerical schemes via the so-called B-series. They have also been used extensively in rough analysis for expanding solutions of singular Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs). When one considers scalar-valued equations, the most efficient combinatorial set is multi-indices. In this paper, we investigate the existence of intermediate combinatorial sets that will lie between multi-indices and rooted trees. We provide a negative result stating that there is no combinatorial set encoding elementary differentials in dimension $d\neq 1$, and compatible with the rooted trees and the multi-indices aside from the rooted trees. This does not close the debate of the existence of such combinatorial sets, but it shows that it cannot be obtained via a naive and natural approach.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Deleted a theorem and corollary on endomorphims because of misstated hypotheses. These deletions were not used elsewhere in the manuscript

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We say that an abelian variety $A_{/\mathbf Q}$ of dimension $g$ is {\em prosaic} if it is semistable, with good reduction at 2 and its points of order $2$ generate a $2$-extension of ${\mathbf Q}$. For $p \equiv 1 \bmod{8}$, let $M_u$ be the maximal 2-primary unramified abelian extension of $K = {\mathbf Q}(\sqrt{-p})$ and let $h_2 =[M_u:K]$. We construct an indecomposable group scheme $\Xi_p$ over ${\mathbf Z}[\frac{1}{p}]$ of exponent 2 with field of points $M_u$. Assume that $A$ is prosaic, with bad reduction at only one prime $p$. Then $p \equiv 1 \bmod{8}$ and $A$ is totally toroidal at $p$. We prove that if End $A={\mathbf Z}$, then there is a ${\mathbf Q}$-isogenous abelian variety $B$ such that $B[2]$ is a subquotient of $\Xi_p$. We thereby show that $2g+2 \le h_2$ and $p$ has the form $a^2+16b^2$, with $a+4b \equiv \pm 1 \bmod{8}$. Moreover, if $2g + 4 \le h_2$, then $p$ has the form $a^2+64b^2$, with $a \equiv \pm 1 \bmod{8}$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Rose Berry &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a non-Archimedean local field $F$ of residue cardinality $q=p^r$, we give an explicit classical generator $V$ for the bounded derived category $D_{fg}^b(\mathsf{H}_1(G))$ of finitely generated unipotent representations of $G=\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $l\neq p$. The generator $V$ has an explicit description that is much simpler than any known progenerator in the underived setting. This generalises a previous result of the author in the case where $n=2$ and $l$ is odd dividing $q+1$, and provides a triangulated equivalence between $D_{fg}^b(\mathsf{H}_1(G))$ and the category of perfect complexes over the dg algebra of dg endomorphisms of a projective resolution of $V$. This dg algebra can be thought of as a dg-enhanced Schur algebra. As an intermediate step, we also prove the analogous result for the case where $F$ is a finite field.</p></details>

We sincerely thank Professor Ulrich Thiel, an expert in the OSCAR computer algebra system, for the very interesting and useful professional discussions and exchanges. Through these exchanges, we had the opportunity to approach the OSCAR computer algebra system and develop more efficient computational programs

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the field of characteristic two, $\mathbb F_2.$ Denote by $GL(q)$ the general linear group of rank $q$ over $\mathbb F_2.$ The algebraic transfer, introduced by W. Singer [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523], is a rather effective tool for unraveling the intricate structure of the (mod-2) cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr A}^{q,*}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2).$ The Kameko homomorphism is one of the useful tools to study the dimension of the domain of the Singer transfer. Singer conjectured that the algebraic transfer is always a monomorphism, but this remains open for all homology degrees $q\geq 5.$ In this paper, by constructing a novel algorithm implemented in the computer algebra system OSCAR for computing $GL(q)$-invariants of the kernel of the Kameko homomorphism, we disprove Singer's conjecture for bidegree $(6, 6+36).$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2018, Chen, Han and Zhou introduced a criterion to determine whether the HRS-tilt at a given torsion pair induces derived equivalence. We showcase four applications of this criterion: to stable torsion pairs in arbitrary abelian categories (which we prove to always induce derived equivalence), to abelian categories of global dimension at most two, to (co)hereditary torsion pairs over artin algebras (for which we give a purely combinatorial criterion for derived equivalence), and to study whether irreducible silting mutation acts transitively on two-term tilting complexes over a finite dimensional algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We discuss the role of primes of good reduction in the existence of the Brauer--Manin obstruction to weak approximation for varieties defined over number fields. Following Bright and Newton, we give some necessaries conditions on the ramification index that the prime ideal of the number field should satisfy in order to be involved in the Brauer--Manin obstruction to weak approximation. To support the results, many examples of transcendental Brauer--Manin obstruction to weak approximation on K3 surfaces are given.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 16 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the modularity of the functions of the form $r(\tau)^ar(2\tau)^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers with $(a,b)\neq (0,0)$ and $r(\tau)$ is the Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction, which may be considered as companions to the Ramanujan's function $k(\tau)=r(\tau)r(2\tau)^2$. In particular, we show that under some condition on $a$ and $b$, there are finitely many such functions generating the field of all modular functions on the congruence subgroup $\Gamma_1(10)$. Furthermore, we establish certain arithmetic properties of the function $l(\tau)=r(2\tau)/r(\tau)^2$, which can be used to evaluate these products. We employ the methods of Lee and Park, and some properties of $\eta$-quotients and generalized $\eta$-quotients to prove our results.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Higher Lie characters form a distinguished family of symmetric group characters, which appear in many areas of algebra and combinatorics. An old open problem of Thrall is to decompose them into irreducibles. We propose a novel asymptotic approach to this problem, showing that many families of higher Lie characters tend to be proportional to the regular character. In particular, a random higher Lie character tends, in probability, to be proportional to the regular character.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages, 2 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a modification of the hyperbolic circle problem: instead of all elements of a Fuchsian group $\Gamma$, we consider the double cosets by two hyperbolic subgroups. This has a geometric interpretation in terms of the number of common perpendiculars between two closed geodesics for $\Gamma \backslash\mathbb{H}$. We prove an explicit relative trace formula, which is flexible for the counting problem. Using a large sieve inequality developed by the first author and Voskou, we prove a new bound in mean square for the error term of order $O(X^{1/2}\log X)$. We conjecture that this is the correct order of growth. Along the way we provide a new proof of the pointwise error bound $O(X^{2/3})$, originally proved by Good.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A More Sums Than Differences (MSTD) set is a finite set of integers $A$ where the cardinality of its sumset, $A+A$, is greater than the cardinality of its difference set, $A-A$. We address a problem posed by Samuel Allen Alexander that asks whether there exists an infinite sequence of sets alternating between being MSTD and More Differences Than Sums (MDTS), where each set properly contains the previous. While a companion paper resolved this using `filling in' techniques, we solve the more challenging `non-filling-in' version, where any missing integer between a set's minimum and maximum elements remains missing in all subsequent sets.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Faustin Adiceam, Dzmitry Badziahin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a prime $p$, the $p$-adic Littlewood Conjecture stands as a well-known arithmetic variant of the celebrated Littlewood Conjecture in Diophantine Approximation. In the same way as the latter, it admits a natural function field analogue depending on the choice of an irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ with coefficients in a field $\mathbb{K}$. This analogue is referred to as the $P(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture ($P(t)$-LC for short). $P(t)$-LC is proved to fail for any choice of irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ over any ground field $\mathbb{K}$ with characteristic $ \ell \equiv 3\pmod{4}$. The counterexample refuting it is shown to present a local arithmetic obstruction emerging from the fact that -1 is not a quadratic residue modulo a prime $\ell\equiv 3\pmod{4}$. The theory developed elucidates and generalises all previous approaches towards refuting the conjecture. They were all based on the computer-assisted method initiated by Adiceam, Nesharim and Lunnon (2021) which has been able to establish that $P(t)$-LC fails in some small characteristics (essentially up to 11). This computer-assisted method is, however, unable to provide a general statement as it relies on ad hoc computer verifications which, provided they terminate, refute $P(t)$--LC in a given characteristic. This limitation is overcome by exhibiting an arithmetic obstruction to the validity of $P(t)$--LC in infinitely many characteristics.This leaves the remaining case of odd characteristics $\ell\equiv 1\pmod{4}$ dependent on their full determination.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Designing a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for factoring univariate polynomials over finite fields remains a notorious open problem. In this paper, we present an unconditional deterministic algorithm that takes as input an irreducible polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, and computes the factorisation of its reductions modulo $p$ for all primes $p$ up to a prescribed bound $N$. The \emph{average running time per prime} is polynomial in the size of the input and the degree of the splitting field of $f$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. In particular, if $f$ is Galois, we succeed in factoring in (amortised) deterministic polynomial time.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the hyperrigidity of subsets of unital $C^*$-algebras annihilated by states (or, more generally, by completely positive maps). This is closely related to the concept of rigidity at $0$ introduced by G. Salomon, who studied hyperrigid subsets of Cuntz and Cuntz-Krieger algebras. The absence of the unit in a hyperrigid set allows for the existence of $R$-dilations with non-isometric $R$. The existence of such an $R$-dilation forces the state annihilating the hyperrigid set to be a character. Using a dilation-theoretic approach, we provide multiple equivalent criteria for hyperrigidity involving intertwining relations for representations, valid in both commutative and noncommutative settings. We develop structural models for such dilations via orthogonal decompositions into two or three components, determined by defect operators and generalized eigenspaces associated with underlying representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the following statement about any Siegel modular form $F$ of degree $n$ and arbitrary odd level $N$ on the group $\Gamma_1^{(n)}(N)$. Let $A(F,T)$ denote the Fourier coefficients of $F$ and write $T=(T(i,j))$. Suppose that $F$ has a non-zero Fourier coefficient $A(F,T_0)$ such that $(T_0(n,n),N)=1$. Then there exist infinitely many odd and square-free (and thus fundamental) integers $m$ such that $m=\mathrm{discriminant}(T)$ and $A(F,T)\neq 0$. In the case of odd degrees, we prove a stronger result by replacing odd and square-free with odd and prime. We also prove quantitative results towards this. As a consequence, we can show in particular that the statement of the main result in arXiv:2408.03442 about the algebraicity of certain critical values of the spinor $L$-functions of holomorphic newforms (in the ambit of Deligne's conjectures) on congruence subgroups of $\mathrm{GSp}(3)$ is unconditional.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a sequence of cyclotomic integers (Gaussian periods) of particularly small Mahler measure/height. We study the asymptotics of their Mahler measure as a function of their conductor, to find that the growth rate is the (multivariate) Mahler measure of a family of log Calabi-Yau varieties of increasing dimension. In turn, we study the asymptotics of some of these Mahler measures as the dimension increases, as well as properties of the associated algebraic dynamical system. We describe computational experiments that suggest that these cyclotomic integers realise the smallest non-zero logarithmic Mahler measure in the set of algebraic integers with cyclic Galois group of a given odd order. Finally, we discuss some precise conjectures that imply double logarithmic growth for those Mahler measures as a function of that order. The proofs use ideas from the theory of quantitative equidistribution, reflexive polytopes and toric varieties, the theory of random walks, Bessel functions, class field theory, and Linnik's constant.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a matrix $A \in Z^{k \times n}$ of rank $k$, the diagonal Frobenius number $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ is defined as the minimum $t \in Z_{\geq 1}$, such that, for any $b \in \text{span}_{Z}(A)$, the condition \begin{equation*} \exists x \in R_{\geq 0}^n,\, x \geq t \cdot 1 \colon \quad b = A x \end{equation*} implies that \begin{equation*} \exists z \in Z_{\geq 0}^n \colon\quad b = A z. \end{equation*} In this work, we show that \begin{equation*} F_{\text{diag}}(A) = \Delta + O(\log k), \end{equation*} where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum absolute value of $k \times k$ sub-determinants of $A$. From the computational complexity perspective, we show that the integer vector $z$ can be found by a polynomial-time algorithm for some weaker values of $t$ in the described condition. For example, we can choose $t = O( \Delta \cdot \log k)$ or $t = \Delta + O(\sqrt{k} \cdot \log k)$. Additionally, in the assumption that a $2^k$-time preprocessing is allowed or a base $J$ with $|{\det A_{J}}| = \Delta$ is given, we can choose $t = \Delta + O(\log k)$. Finally, we define a more general notion of the diagonal Frobenius number for slacks $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$, which is a generalization of $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ for canonical-form systems, like $A x \leq b$. All the proofs are mainly done with respect to $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$. The proof technique uses some properties of the Gomory's corner polyhedron relaxation and tools from discrepancy theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The periodic Temperley-Lieb category consists of connectivity diagrams drawn on a ring with $N$ and $N'$ nodes on the outer and inner boundary, respectively. We consider families of modules, namely sequences of modules $\mathsf{M}(N)$ over the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra for varying values of $N$, endowed with an action $\mathsf{M}(N') \to \mathsf{M}(N)$ of the diagrams. Examples of modules that can be organised into families are those arising in the RSOS model and in the XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain, as well as several others constructed from link states. We construct a fusion product which outputs a family of modules from any pair of families. Its definition is inspired from connectivity diagrams drawn on a disc with two holes. It is thus defined in a way to describe intermediate states in lattice correlation functions. We prove that this fusion product is a bifunctor, and that it is distributive, commutative, and associative.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a purely geometric explanation of the coincidence between the Coulomb Branch equations for the 3D GLSM describing the quantum $K$-theory of a flag variety, and the Bethe Ansatz equations of the 5-vertex lattice model. In doing so, we prove two explicit presentations for the quantum $K$-ring of the flag variety, resolving conjectures of Gu-Sharpe-Mihalcea-Xu-Zhang-Zou and Rimanyi-Tarasov-Varchenko. We also prove that the stable map and quasimap $K$-theory of the partial flag varieties are isomorphic, using the work of Koroteev-Pushkar-Smirnov-Zeitlin identifying the latter ring with the Bethe algebra of the 5-vertex lattice model. Our isomorphism gives an additional interpretation of the quantum tautological bundles described in the quasimap ring.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent years, significant progress has been made on Mazur's Program B, with many authors beginning a systematic classification of all possible images of $p$-adic Galois representations attached to elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$. Currently, the classification is only complete for $p \in \{2,3,13,17\}$. The main difficulty for other primes arises from the need to understand elliptic curves whose mod-$p^n$ Galois representations are contained in the normaliser of a non-split Cartan subgroup. Equivalently, this amounts to determining the rational points on the modular curves $X_{ns}^+(p^n)$. Here, we consider the case $p=7$ and show that the modular curve $X_{ns}^+(49)$, of genus 69, has no non-CM rational points. To achieve this, we establish a correspondence between the rational points on $X_{ns}^+(49)$ and the primitive integer solutions of the generalised Fermat equation $a^2 + 28b^3 = 27 c^7$, the resolution of which can be reduced to determining the rational points of several genus-three curves. Furthermore, we reduce the complete classification of $7$-adic images to the determination of the rational points of a single plane quartic.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 102 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use the theory of reduced determinant functors from [24] to give a new, computationally useful, description of the relative $K_0$-groups of orders in finite dimensional separable algebras that need not be commutative. By combining this approach with a canonical generalization to non-commutative algebras of the notion of `zeta element' introduced by Kato [52], we then formulate, for each odd prime $p$, a natural main conjecture of non-commutative $p$-adic Iwasawa theory for $\mathbb{G}_m$ over arbitrary number fields. This conjecture predicts a simple relation between a canonical Rubin-Stark non-commutative Euler system that we introduce and the compactly supported $p$-adic cohomology of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and is shown to simultaneously extend both the higher rank (commutative) main conjecture for $\mathbb{G}_m$ formulated by Kurihara and the present authors [19] and the $K$-theoretical formalism of main conjectures in non-commutative Iwasawa theory developed by Ritter and Weiss [73] and by Coates, Fukaya, Kato, Sujatha and Venjakob [27]. In particular, via these links we obtain strong evidence in support of the conjecture in the setting of Galois CM extensions of totally real fields. Our approach also leads to the formulation over arbitrary number fields of a precise conjectural `higher derivative formula' for the Rubin-Stark non-commutative Euler system that is shown to recover upon appropriate specialisation the classical Gross-Stark Conjecture for Deligne-Ribet $p$-adic $L$-functions. We then show that this conjectural derivative formula can be combined with the main conjecture of non-commutative $p$-adic Iwasawa theory to give a strategy for obtaining evidence in support of the equivariant Tamagawa Number Conjecture for $\mathbb{G}_m$ over arbitrary finite Galois extensions of number fields, thereby obtaining a wide-ranging generalization of the main result of [19].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove G\"ortz's combinatorial conjecture \cite{Go01} on dual shellability of admissible sets in Iwahori-Weyl groups, proving that the augmented admissible set $\widehat{\mathrm{Adm}}(\mu)$ is dual shellable for any dominant coweight $\mu$. This provides a uniform, elementary approach to establishing Cohen-Macaulayness of the special fibers of the local models with Iwahori level structure for all reductive groups-including residue characteristic $2$ and non-reduced root systems-circumventing geometric methods. Local models, which encode singularities of Shimura varieties and moduli of shtukas, have seen extensive study since their introduction by Rapoport-Zink, with Cohen-Macaulayness remaining a central open problem. While previous work relied on case-specific geometric analyses (e.g., Frobenius splittings \cite{HR23} or compactifications \cite{He13}), our combinatorial proof yields an explicit labeling that constructs the special fiber by sequentially adding irreducible components while preserving Cohen-Macaulayness at each step, a new result even for split groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We will employ the method of contour integration to investigate the parity results of non-embedded cyclotomic multiple $t$-values, which we refer to as cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums. We can provide explicit parity formulas for the linear and quadratic cases of cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums, as well as state a parity theorem for the general case. We also present illustrative examples and corollaries. From this, some parity results for classical cyclotomic multiple $t$-values can be derived. Furthermore, we present several general formulas for cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums with denominators involving arbitrary rational polynomials through residue computations. By evaluating these polynomials and computing residues, many other formulas analogous to cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums can be derived. In particular, we also obtain certain parity results for the cyclotomic versions of multiple $T$-values as defined by Kaneko and Tsumura. Finally, we propose some conjectures and questions regarding the parity of cyclotomic multiple $t$-values and cyclotomic multiple $T$-values.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a bijective correspondence between the set of rigid modules over a gentle algebra and the set of admissible arc systems on the associated coordinated-marked surface. In particular, a maximal rigid module aligns with an equivalence class of admissible $5$-partial triangulations, which is an (admissible) set of simple arcs dissecting the surface into $s$-gons with $3\leqslant s\leqslant 5$. Furthermore, the rank of the maximal rigid module is equal to the rank of the algebra plus the number of internal $4$-gons and $5$-gons in the associated $5$-partial triangulation. Subsequently, these results facilitate an exploration of the higher Auslander-Reiten theory for gentle algebras with global dimension $n$. The $\tau_m$-closures of injective modules are realized as admissible $(m+2)$-partial triangulations, where $\tau_m$ are higher Auslander-Reiten translations with $2\leqslant m \leqslant n$. Finally, we provide a complete classification of gentle algebras that are $\tau_n$-finite or $n$-complete introduced by Iyama [I11].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $J_{1,m}(N)$ be the vector space of Jacobi forms of weight one and index $m$ on $\Gamma_0(N)$. In 1985, Skoruppa proved that $J_{1,m}(1)=0$ for all $m$. In 2007, Ibukiyama and Skoruppa proved that $J_{1,m}(N)=0$ for all $m$ and all squarefree $N$ with $\mathrm{gcd}(m,N)=1$. This paper aims to extend their results. We determine all levels $N$ separately, such that $J_{1,m}(N)=0$ for all $m$; or $J_{1,m}(N)=0$ for all $m$ with $\mathrm{gcd}(m,N)=1$. We also establish explicit dimension formulas of $J_{1,m}(N)$ when $m$ and $N$ are relatively prime or $m$ is squarefree. These results are obtained by refining Skoruppa's method and analyzing local invariants of Weil representations. As applications, we prove the vanishing of Siegel modular forms of degree two and weight one in some cases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the structural and characterizing properties of the so-called {\it 2-UQ rings}, that are rings such that the square of every unit is the sum of an idempotent and a quasi-nilpotent element that commute with each other. We establish some fundamental connections between 2-UQ rings and relevant widely classes of rings including 2-UJ, 2-UU and tripotent rings. Our novel results include: (1) complete characterizations of 2-UQ group rings, showing that they force underlying groups to be either 2-groups or 3-groups when $3 \in J(R)$; (2) Morita context extensions preserving the 2-UQ property when trace ideals are nilpotent; and (3) the discovery that potent 2-UQ rings are precisely the semi-tripotent rings. Furthermore, we determine how the 2-UQ property interacts with the regularity, cleanness and potent conditions. Likewise, certain examples and counter-examples illuminate the boundaries between 2-UQ rings and their special relatives. These achievements of ours somewhat substantially expand those obtained by Cui-Yin in Commun. Algebra (2020) and by Danchev {\it et al.} in J. Algebra \& Appl. (2025).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Under some technical assumptions, and building on joint work with Bezrukavnikov, we prove a multiplicity formula for indecomposable tilting perverse sheaves on affine flag varieties, with coefficients in a field of characteristic $p$, in terms of $p$-Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials. Under the same assumptions, we also explain the construction of a "degrading functor" relating mixed modular perverse sheaves (as defined in joint work with Achar) on such varieties to ordinary perverse sheaves.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\alpha$ be a Steinhaus random multiplicative function. For a wide class of multiplicative functions $f$ we construct a multiplicative chaos measure arising from the Dirichlet series of $\alpha f$, in the whole $L^1$-regime. Our method does not rely on the thick point approach or Gaussian approximation, and uses a modified second moment method with the help of an approximate Girsanov theorem. We also employ the idea of weak convergence in $L^r$ to show that the limiting measure is independent of the choice of the approximation schemes, and this may be seen as a non-Gaussian analogue of Shamov's characterisation of multiplicative chaos. Our class of $f$-s consists of those for which the mean value of $|f(p)|^2$ lies in $(0,1)$. In particular, it includes the indicator of sums of two squares. As an application of our construction, we establish a generalised central limit theorem for the (normalised) sums of $\alpha f$, with random variance determined by the total mass of our measure.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish the limiting distribution of $\frac{{(\log \log x)}^{1/4}}{\sqrt{x}} \sum_{n\le x}\alpha(n)$ where $\alpha$ is a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, answering a question of Harper. The distributional convergence is proved by applying the martingale central limit theorem to a suitably truncated sum. This truncation is inspired by work of Najnudel, Paquette, Simm and Vu on subcritical holomorphic multiplicative chaos setting, but analysed with a different conditioning argument generalised from Harper's work on fractional moments to circumvent integrability issues at criticality. A significant part of the proof is devoted to the convergence in probability of the associated partial Euler product to a critical multiplicative chaos measure, independent of the mild shift away from the critical line. Our approach to the universality of critical non-Gaussian multiplicative chaos bypasses the barrier analysis with the help of a modified second moment method, and employs a novel argument based on coupling and homogenisation by change of measure, which could be of independent interest.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is natural to consider extending the typical construction of relative Poisson algebras from commutative differential algebras to the context of bialgebras. The known bialgebra structures for relative Poisson algebras, namely relative Poisson bialgebras, are equivalent to Manin triples of relative Poisson algebras with respect to the symmetric bilinear forms which are invariant on both the commutative associative and Lie algebras. However, they are not consistent with commutative and cocommutative differential antisymmetric infinitesimal (ASI) bialgebras as the bialgebra structures for commutative differential algebras. Alternatively, with the invariance replaced by the commutative $2$-cocycles on the Lie algebras, the corresponding Manin triples of relative Poisson algebras are proposed, which are shown to be equivalent to certain bialgebra structures, namely relative PCA bialgebras. They serve as another approach to the bialgebra theory for relative Poisson algebras, which can be naturally constructed from commutative and cocommutative differential ASI bialgebras. The notion of the relative PCA Yang-Baxter equation (RPCA-YBE) in a relative PCA algebra is introduced, whose antisymmetric solutions give coboundary relative PCA bialgebras. The notions of $\mathcal{O}$-operators of relative PCA algebras and relative pre-PCA algebras are also introduced to give antisymmetric solutions of the RPCA-YBE.</p></details>

In the case of $\ell=1$ and $E$ the multiples of $k$, $p_{E,1}\left( n\right) $ represents the number of $k$-regular partitions. More generally, let $f_{\ell}$ satisfy a certain growth condition. We determine the signs of $\Delta _{E,\ell }(n)$ for $\ell$ large. The signs mainly depend on the occurrence of subsets of $\{2,3,4,5\}$ as a part of the exception set and the residue class of $n$ modulo $ r$, where $r $ depends on $E$. For example, let $2,3 \in S$ and $4$ an exception. Let $n$ be large. Then for almost all $\ell$ we have \begin{equation*} \Delta _{E,\ell }(n) >0 \,\,\, \text{ for } n\equiv 2 \pmod{3}. \end{equation*} If we assume $3,4 \in S$ and $2$ an exception. Let $n$ be large. Then for almost all $\ell$ we have \begin{equation*} \Delta _{E,\ell }(n) < 0 \,\,\, \text{ for } n\equiv 2 \pmod{3}. \end{equation*} Note that this property is independent of the integers $k\in S,k>4$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study Chabauty limits of the fixed-point group of $k$-points $H_k$ associated with an involutive $k$-automorphism $\theta$ of a connected linear reductive group $G$ defined over a non-Archimedean local field $k$ of characteristic zero. Leveraging the geometry of the Bruhat--Tits building, the structure of $(\theta,k)$-split tori, and the $K\mathcal{B}_kH_k$ decomposition of $G_k$, we establish that any nontrivial Chabauty limit $L$ of $H_k$ is $G_k$-conjugate to a subgroup of $$U_{\sigma_+}(k) \rtimes (Ker(\alpha)^0 \cdot (H_k \cap M_{\sigma_{\pm}})) \leq P_{\sigma_+}(k),$$ where $\alpha$ is a projection map arising from a Levi factor $M_{\sigma_{\pm}}$ of a parabolic subgroup $P_{\sigma_+} \subset G$, and $Ker(\alpha)^0$ denotes the subgroup of elliptic elements in the kernel of $\alpha$. Our analysis distinguishes between elliptic and hyperbolic elements and constructs explicit unipotent elements in the limit group $L$ using the Moufang property of $G_k$. Furthermore, we show that $L$ acts transitively on the set of ideal simplices opposite to $\sigma_+$. These results yield a detailed description of the Chabauty compactification of $H_k$, and provide new insights into its interaction with the non-Archimedean geometry of $G_k$.</p></details>

We introduce and investigate related concepts such as locally algebraic $({\mathfrak g},K)$-modules and cohomological types of automorphic representations. Applying the recently developed theory of tdos and twisted $\mathcal D$-modules over schemes by Hayashi and the author, we establish the existence of canonical global $1/N$-integral structures on spaces of automorphic cusp forms. As an application, we define canonical periods attached to regular algebraic automorphic representations, potentially related to the action of Venkatesh's derived Hecke algebra on cuspidal cohomology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Katz and Sarnak conjectured that the behavior of zeros near the central point of any family of $L$-functions is well-modeled by the behavior of eigenvalues near $1$ of some classical compact group (either the symplectic, unitary, or even, odd, or full orthogonal group). In 2018, Knightly and Reno proved that the symmetry group can vary depending on how the $L$-functions in the family are weighted. They observed both orthogonal and symplectic symmetry in the one-level densities of families of cuspidal newform $L$-functions for different choices of weights. We observe the same dependence of symmetry on weights in the $n^{\text{th}}$ centered moments of these one-level densities, for smooth test functions whose Fourier transforms are supported in $\left(-\frac{1}{2n}, \frac{1}{2n}\right)$. To treat the new terms that emerge in our $n$-level calculations when $n>1$, i.e., the cross terms that emerge from $n$-fold products of primes rather than individual primes, we generalize Knightly and Reno's weighted trace formula from primes to arbitrary positive integers. We then perform a delicate analysis of these cross terms to distinguish their contributions to the main and error terms of the $n^{\text{th}}$ centered moments. The final novelty here is an elementary combinatorial trick that we use to rewrite the main number theoretic terms arising from our analysis, facilitating comparisons with random matrix theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The celebrated Artin conjecture on primitive roots asserts that given any integer $g$ which is neither $-1$ nor a perfect square, there is an explicit constant $A(g)>0$ such that the number $\Pi(x;g)$ of primes $p\le x$ for which $g$ is a primitive root is asymptotically $A(g)\pi(x)$ as $x\to\infty$, where $\pi(x)$ counts the number of primes not exceeding $x$. Artin's conjecture has remained unsolved since its formulation in 1927. Nevertheless, Hooley demonstrated in 1967 that Artin's conjecture is a consequence of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) for Dedekind zeta functions of certain cyclotomic-Kummer extensions over $\mathbb{Q}$. In this paper, we use GRH to establish a uniform version of the Artin--Hooley asymptotic formula. Specifically, we prove that $\Pi(x;g) \sim A(g) x/\log{x}$ whenever $\log{x}/\log\log{2|g|} \to \infty$, i.e., whenever $x$ tends to infinity faster than any power of $\log{(2|g|)}$. Under GRH, we also show that the least prime $p_g$ possessing $g$ as a primitive root satisfies the upper bound $p_g=O(\log^{19}(2|g|))$ uniformly for all non-square $g\ne-1$. We conclude with an application to the average value of $p_g$ and a discussion of an analogue concerning the least "almost-primitive'' root.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a construction of "integral local Shimura varieties" which are formal schemes that generalize the well-known integral models of the Drinfeld $p$-adic upper half spaces. The construction applies to all classical groups, at least for odd $p$. These formal schemes also generalize the formal schemes defined by Rapoport-Zink via moduli of $p$-divisible groups, and are characterized purely in group-theoretic terms. More precisely, for a local $p$-adic Shimura datum $(G, b, \mu)$ and a quasi-parahoric group scheme $\mathcal G$ for $G$, Scholze has defined a functor on perfectoid spaces which parametrizes $p$-adic shtukas. He conjectured that this functor is representable by a normal formal scheme which is locally formally of finite type and flat over $O_{\breve E}$. Scholze-Weinstein proved this conjecture when $(G, b, \mu)$ is of (P)EL type by using Rapoport-Zink formal schemes. We prove this conjecture for any $(G, \mu)$ of abelian type when $p\neq 2$, and when $p=2$ and $G$ is of type $A$ or $C$. We also relate the generic fiber of this formal scheme to the local Shimura variety, a rigid-analytic space attached by Scholze to $(G, b, \mu, {\mathcal G})$.</p></details>

The construction given here also yields explicit descriptions of the indecomposable projectives. These results are used to give a convenient set of projective generators of the category of representations of $\mathbf{FA}$ and hence a Morita equivalence result. This is used to explain how to calculate the multiplicities of the composition factors of an arbitrary object, based only on its underlying $\mathbf{FB}$-representation, where $\mathbf{FB}$ is the category of finite sets and bijections. This is applied to show how to calculate the morphism spaces between projectives in our chosen set of generators, as well as for a closely related family of objects (the significance of which can be shown by relative nonhomogeneous Koszul duality theory).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the local Langlands functoriality transfer from $\text{SO}(5, F)$ to $\text{GL}(4, F)$ for arbitrary twists of several families of irreducible supercuspidal representations of $\text{GL}(4, F)$, where $F$ is a non-archimedean local field of characteristic zero. In doing so, we give equivalent conditions for such representations to be functoriality transfers from $\text{SO}(5, F)$ in terms of the Bushnell-Kutzko construction of supercuspidal representations by studying poles of local exterior square $L$-functions and the existence of non-zero local Shalika models. This article provides a starting point for an explicit characterization of this functoriality transfer in terms of type theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{F}_n$ be the set of unitary cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n$ over a number field $F$, and let $S\subseteq\mathfrak{F}_n$ be an arbitrary finite subset. Given $\pi_0\in\mathfrak{F}_{n_0}$, we establish large sieve inequalities for the families $\{L(s,\pi)\colon \pi\in S\}$ and $\{L(s,\pi\times\pi_0)\colon \pi\in S\}$ that, unlike previous results, are independent of progress towards the generalized Ramanujan conjecture, and simultaneously handle the Dirichlet coefficients of $L$, $L^{-1}$, and $\log L$. We also give the first such result that improves upon the trivial bound for short sums. We present several applications, including: (1) the strongest bound for $\sum_{\pi\in S}|L(\frac{1}{2},\pi)|^2$ that holds for arbitrary $S$, (2) significant improvements to zero density estimates for families of automorphic and Rankin--Selberg $L$-functions, counting violations to the generalized Riemann hypothesis near $\mathrm{Re}(s)=1$, (3) the removal of all unproven hypotheses in the conditional log-free zero density estimate for families of Rankin--Selberg $L$-functions proved by Brumley, Thorner, and Zaman, and (4) an improvement of the density theorem for non-archimedean Langlands parameters due to Lichtman and Pascadi, counting violations to the generalized Ramanujan conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that an abelian variety and its dual over a global field have the same Faltings height and, more precisely, have isomorphic Hodge line bundles, including their natural metrized bundle structures. More carefully treating real places, we also show that these abelian varieties have the same real and global periods that appear in the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.</p></details>
