 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Evgeny Mukhin, Alexander Varchenko &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math-ph &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In [J. Lond. Math. Soc. 109 (2024), e12884, 22 pages, arXiv:2208.09721], the difference qKZ equations were considered modulo a prime number $p$ and a family of polynomial solutions of the qKZ equations modulo $p$ was constructed by an elementary procedure as suitable $p$-approximations of the hypergeometric integrals. In this paper, we study in detail the first family of nontrivial examples of the qKZ equations in characteristic $p$. We describe all solutions of these qKZ equations in characteristic $p$ by demonstrating that they all stem from the $p$-hypergeometric solutions. We also prove a Lagrangian property (called the orthogonality property) of the subbundle of the qKZ bundle spanned by the $p$-hypergeometric sections. This paper extends the results of [arXiv:2405.05159] on the differential KZ equations to the difference qKZ equations.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tianqing Zhu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 86 pages. The main result of the paper has been strengthened and generalised, many corrections and improvement of the statements. Comments are very welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we prove the following results: Given the Drinfeld double $\mathcal{A}^{ext}_{Q}$ of the localised preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+}_{Q}$ of quiver type $Q$ with the Cartan elements, there is a $\mathbb{Q}(q,t_e)_{e\in E}$-Hopf algebra isomorphism between $\mathcal{A}^{ext}_{Q}$ and the localised Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop group $U^{MO}_{q}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$ of quiver type $Q$. Moreover, we prove the isomorphism of $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm1},t_{e}^{\pm1}]_{e\in E}$-algebras between the positive/negative half of the integral Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop group $U_{q}^{MO,\pm,\mathbb{Z}}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$ with the (opposite) algebra of the integral preprojective (nilpotent) $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+,\mathbb{Z}}_{Q}$ ($(\mathcal{A}^{+,nilp,\mathbb{Z}}_{Q})^{op}$) of the same quiver type $Q$. As the application, we prove that one can identify the wall subalgebra $U_{q}^{MO,\mathbb{Z}}(\mathfrak{g}_{w})$ as the root subalgebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{m},w}^{\mathbb{Z}}$ in the slope subalgebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{m}}^{\mathbb{Z}}$ as the quasitriangular Hopf $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm1},t_e^{\pm1}]_{e\in E}$-algebras. Moreover we use the freeness of the wall subalgebra in MO quantum loop groups to prove the freeness of the preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebra for arbitrary torus $\mathbb{C}_q^*\subset A\subset T$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Finn Bartsch, Frédéric Campana, Ariyan Javanpeykar, Olivier Wittenberg &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 29 pages; comments welcome; v2: minor changes to abstract and introduction; v3: minor changes, final version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Starting from an Enriques surface over $\mathbb{Q}(t)$ considered by Lafon, we give the first examples of smooth projective weakly special threefolds which fibre over the projective line in Enriques surfaces (resp. K3 surfaces) with nowhere reduced, but non-divisible, fibres and general type orbifold base. We verify that these families of Enriques surfaces (resp. K3 surfaces) are non-isotrivial and compute their fundamental groups by studying the behaviour of local points along certain étale covers. The existence of the above threefolds implies that the Weakly Special Conjecture formulated in 2000 contradicts the Orbifold Mordell Conjecture, and hence the abc conjecture. Using these examples, we can also easily disprove several complex-analytic analogues of the Weakly Special Conjecture. Finally, the existence of such threefolds shows that Enriques surfaces and K3 surfaces can have non-divisible but nowhere reduced degenerations, thereby answering a question raised in 2005.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v1: 46pages, v2: minor editions

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we present algorithms for computing parabolic inductions and Jacquet modules for the general linear group $G$ over a non-Archimedean local field. Given the Zelevinsky data or Langlands data of an irreducible smooth representation $π$ of $G$ and an essentially square-integrable representation $σ$, we explicitly determine the Jacquet module of $π$ with respect to $σ$ and the socle of the normalized parabolic induction $π\times σ$. Our result builds on and extends some previous work of Mœglin-Waldspurger, Jantzen, Mínguez, and Lapid-Mínguez, and also uses other methods such as sequences of derivatives and an exotic duality. As an application, we give a simple algorithm for computing the highest derivative multisegment and an algorithm for computing the Langlands parameter of the highest Bernstein-Zelevinsky derivatives.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the Hernandez conjecture on the simple $(q,t)$-characters (an analog of the Kazhdan--Lusztig conjecture) for untwisted quantum loop algebras of classical type. This result is new in type $\mathrm{C}$. We also prove that the folding homomorphism, introduced by Hernandez, gives a dimension-preserving bijective correspondence between the finite-dimensional simple representations of untwisted quantum loop algebras of classical simply-laced type and those of the corresponding doubly-twisted quantum loop algebras. This result is new in type $\mathrm{D}$. In our approach, we develop a bootstrapping method for $q$ and $(q,t)$-characters, based on the freezing operator previously introduced in the context of cluster algebras by the second named author. This method allows us to reduce statements for general simple representations in all classical types to corresponding results on core subcategories in a uniform manner.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages, comments welcome, v2: fixed some typos, v3: minor corrections

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $P,Q$ be standard parabolic subgroups of a $p$-adic reductive group $G$. We study the smooth dual of the filtration on a parabolically induced module arising from the geometric lemma associated to the cosets $P\setminus G/Q$. We prove that the dual filtration coincides with the filtration associated to the cosets $P\setminus G/Q^-$ via the Bernstein-Casselman canonical pairing from the second adjointness of parabolic induction. This result generalizes a result of Bezrukavnikov-Kazhdan on the explicit description in the second adjointness. Along the way, we also study some group theoretic results.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Sequel of arXiv:2111.13286

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a non-Archimedean local field. For an irreducible smooth representation $π$ of $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$ and a multisegment $\mathfrak m$, one associates a simple quotient $D_{\mathfrak m}(π)$ of a Bernstein-Zelevinsky derivative of $π$. In the preceding article, we showed that $$ \mathcal S(π, τ) :=\left\{ \mathfrak m : D_{\mathfrak m}(π)\cong τ\right\} , $$ has a unique minimal element under the Zelevinsky ordering, where $\mathfrak m$ runs for all multisegments. The main result of this article includes commutativity and subsequent property of the minimal sequence. At the end of this article, we conjecture some module structure arising from the minimality.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Sequel of arXiv:2111.13286

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a non-Archimedean local field. For any irreducible smooth representation $π$ of $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$ and a multisegment $\mathfrak m$, we have an operation $D_{\mathfrak m}(π)$ to construct a simple quotient $τ$ of a Bernstein-Zelevinsky derivative of $π$. This article continues the previous one to study the following poset $$ \mathcal S(π, τ) :=\left\{ \mathfrak n : D_{\mathfrak n}(π)\cong τ\right\} , $$ where $\mathfrak n$ runs for all the multisegments. Here the partial ordering on $\mathcal S(π, τ)$ comes from the Zelevinsky ordering. We show that the poset has a unique minimal multisegment. Along the way, we introduce two new ingredients: fine chain orderings and local minimizability.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 43 pages. Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we study the mixed fourth moments of Hecke--Maass cusp forms and Eisenstein series with type $(2, 2)$. Under the assumptions of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) and the Generalized Ramanujan Conjecture (GRC), we establish asymptotic formulas for these moments. Our results give an interesting non-equidistribution phenomenon over the full fundamental domain. In fact, this independent equidistribution should be true in a compact set. We further investigate this behaviour by examining a truncated version involving truncated Eisenstein series. Additionally, we propose a conjecture on the joint value distribution of Eisenstein series. The proofs are based on the bounds of the shifted mixed moments of $L$-functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the following decision problems $\bf{(1)}$ and $\bf{(2)}$ are algorithmically undecidable when $n \in N$. $\bf{(1)}$ $\exists (y_0,...,y_n) \in N^{n+1}$ $\forall i,j,k \in \{0,...,n\}$ $(((2^{\textstyle 2^{\textstyle 2^{\textstyle j} \cdot 3^{\textstyle k}}}+1$ divides $n) \Rightarrow$ $(y_j+1=y_k)) \wedge ((2^{\textstyle 2^{\textstyle 2^{\textstyle i} \cdot 3^{\textstyle j} \cdot 5^{\textstyle k+1}}}+1$ divides $n) \Rightarrow$ $(y_i \cdot y_j=y_k)))$. $\bf{(2)}$ $\exists p,q \in N ~((n=2^p \cdot 3^q) \wedge \forall (x_0,...,x_p) \in N^{p+1} ~\exists (y_0,...,y_p) \in \{0,...,q\}^{p+1} ~\forall i,j,k \in \{0,...,p\} ~(((x_j+1=x_k) \Rightarrow (y_j+1=y_k)) \wedge ((x_i \cdot x_j=x_k) \Rightarrow (y_i \cdot y_j=y_k))))$. For $n \in N$, let $E_n=\{1=x_k,~x_i+x_j=x_k,~x_i \cdot x_j=x_k):~i,j,k \in \{0,...,n\}\}$. For $n \in N$, $f(n)$ denotes the smallest $b \in N$ such that if a system of equations $S \subseteq E_n$ has a solution in $N^{n+1}$, then $S$ has a solution in $\{0,...,b\}^{n+1}$. The author proved earlier that the function $f:N \to N$ is computable in the limit and eventually dominates every computable function $g:N \to N$. We present a short program in MuPAD which for $n \in N$ prints the sequence $\{f_i(n)\}_{i=0}^\infty$ of non-negative integers converging to $f(n)$. For $n \in N$, $β(n)$ denotes the smallest $b \in N$ such that if a system of equations $S \subseteq E_n$ has a unique solution in $N^{n+1}$, then this solution belongs to $\{0,...,b\}^{n+1}$. The author proved earlier that the function $β:N \to N$ is computable in the limit and eventually dominates every function $δ:N \to N$ with a single-fold Diophantine representation. The computability of $β$ is unknown. We present a short program in MuPAD which for $n \in N$ prints the sequence $\{β_i(n)\}_{i=0}^\infty$ of non-negative integers converging to $β(n)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 14 pp. Submitted to Inventiones Mathematicae. The new proof of primality of $(s-1)/2$ employsan innovative simple-yet-effective technique. The new proof of SG prime infinitude avoids earlier reliance on congruence manipulations modulo the unique maximal ideal of the valuation domain

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An ideal setting to exhibit infinite sets of primes $p$ relative to which an integer is a primitive root $\pmod p$ is provided by the ultraproduct ring $\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}=\prod_{\mathfrak{U}} \mathbb{Z}_p$ with respect to a nonprincipal ultrafilter $\mathfrak{U}$ on $\wp(\mathbb{P})$, extant via the ultrafilter theorem, such that an infinite subextension $\mathbb{L}$ of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}$ satisfying $\mathrm{tor}(\mathbb{L}^\times)=\{\pm\tilde 1\}$ is realised as the relative algebraic closure $\mathrm{\Abs}(\widetilde{\mathbb{Q}})=\prod_{\mathfrak{U}} \mathbb{Q}_p)$ of the prime field of $\widetilde{\mathbb{Q}}$. Results include positive resolutions of the conjectured infinitude of primes $p$ for which \begin{itemise} \item $\frac{p-1}{2}$ is prime and \item a non-perfect-square $-1\neq m\in\mathbb{Z}\backslash 3\mathbb{Z}$ is a primitive root $\pmod p$, \end{itemise} establishing as manifest the efficacy of ultraproduct treatments in resolving number theory problems requiring authentication of countably infinite conforming sets.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nainrong Feng &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Starting from the classical integral representation of the $ζ(s)$ function introduced by Riemann in 1859, this paper reexamines its analytic symmetry structure. By performing a geometric decomposition of the integral representation, we demonstrate that on the critical line $\Re(s)=\frac{1}{2}$, the value of $ξ(s)$ corresponds strictly to the \textbf{real-part projection} of a specific analytic component. This discovery equivalently transforms the problem of complex zeros into a problem of \textbf{sign evolution} along the real axis. Based on this geometric framework, we \textbf{construct} an analytic mechanism of \textbf{"Two-End Anchoring, Interval Counting"}: the global argument increment on the region boundary \textbf{anchors} the initial value of the phase function, while the geometric decomposition structure on the critical line \textbf{locks} its final value. This mechanism reveals an \textbf{intrinsic coherence} between global topological constraints and local sign oscillations. Unlike traditional methods that rely on asymptotic estimates (such as the Big $O$ error term), the analysis in this paper is \textbf{grounded in} exact identities. It unveils the \textbf{geometric determinism} underlying the zero-counting formula, offering a novel perspective for analytic number theory independent of asymptotic analysis.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb{F}_q^d$ be a $d$-dimensional vector space over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ elements. For $x\in \mathbb{F}_q^d$, let $\|x\| = x_1^2+\dots+x_d^2$. By abuse of terminology, we shall call $\|\cdot\|$ a norm on $\mathbb{F}_q^d$. For a subset $E\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$, let $Δ(E)$ be the distance set on $E$ defined as $Δ(E):=\{\|x-y\| : x, y \in E \}$. The Mattila-Sjölin problem seeks the smallest exponent $α>0$ such that $Δ(E) =\mathbb{F}_q$ for all subsets $E \subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ with $|E| \geq Cq^α$. In this article, we consider this problem for a variant of this norm, which generates a smaller distance set than the norm $\|\cdot\|.$ Namely, we replace the norm $\|\cdot\|$ by the so-called $k$-norm $(1 \leq k \leq d)$, which can be viewed as a kind of deformation of $\|\cdot\|$. To derive our result on the Mattila-Sjölin problem for the $k$-norm, we use a combinatorial method to analyze various summations arising from the discrete Fourier machinery. Even though our distance set is smaller than the one in the Mattila-Sjölin problem, for some $k$ we still obtain the same result as that of Iosevich and Rudnev (2007), which deals with the Mattila-Sjölin problem. Furthermore, our result is sharp in all odd dimensions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Research on the distribution of prime numbers has revealed a dual character: deterministic in definition yet exhibiting statistical behavior reminiscent of random processes. In this paper we show that it is possible to use an image-focused machine learning model to measure the comparative regularity of prime number fields at specific regions of an Ulam spiral. Specifically, we demonstrate that in pure accuracy terms, models trained on blocks extracted from regions of the spiral in the vicinity of 500m outperform models trained on blocks extracted from the region representing integers lower than 25m. This implies existence of more easily learnable order in the former region than in the latter. Moreover, a detailed breakdown of precision and recall scores seem to imply that the model is favouring a different approach to classification in different regions of the spiral, focusing more on identifying prime patterns at lower numbers and more on eliminating composites at higher numbers. This aligns with number theory conjectures suggesting that at higher orders of magnitude we should see diminishing noise in prime number distributions, with averages (density, AP equidistribution) coming to dominate, while local randomness regularises after scaling by log x. Taken together, these findings point toward an interesting possibility: that machine learning can serve as a new experimental instrument for number theory. Notably, the method shows potential 1 for investigating the patterns in strong and weak primes for cryptographic purposes.</p></details>

Unlike the previous approaches in the residually irreducible case from Gouvêa-Mazur, Böckle and Allen, our method relies on local-global compatibility results, potential pro-modularity arguments and a non-ordinary finiteness result between the local deformation ring at $p$ and the global deformation ring. This allows us to construct sufficiently many non-ordinary regular de Rham points whose modularity is guaranteed by the recent progress on the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture. Also, we will discuss some applications of our main results, including the equidimensionality of certain big Hecke algebras and big $R=\mathbb{T}$ theorems in the residually reducible case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By introducing a generalized notion of multiple zeta values associated with an arbitrary finite subset $S\subset \mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$ and studying their transformation properties under rational functions, we show that multiple polylogarithms evaluated at roots of unity (cyclotomic multiple zeta values, CMZVs) can be equivalently expressed in terms of iterated integrals involving certain non-roots of unity. We apply this theory to elucidate previously unknown $\mathbb{Q}$-linear relations among CMZVs: they come from nontrivial solutions of certain $S$-unit equations in the function field of $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$, thereby attaining the motivic dimension for low level and weight. We introduce a datamine of CMZVs that appears to be the first rigorous compilation of this kind in the literature. In addition, we formulate several nontrivial Galois descent conjectures for multiple polylogarithms and present applications to certain Apéry-type infinite series.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We calculate the deformed and non-deformed cohomological Hall algebra (CoHA) of the preprojective algebra for the case of cyclic quivers by studying the Kontsevich-Soibelman CoHA and using tools from cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory. We show that for the cyclic quiver of length $K$, this algebra is the universal enveloping algebra of the positive half of a certain extension of matrix differential operators on $\mathbb{C}^{*}$, while its deformation gives a positive half of an explicit integral form of Guay's Affine Yangian $\ddot{\mathcal{Y}}_{\hbar_1,\hbar_2}(\mathfrak{gl}(K))$. By the main theorem of Botta-Davison (2023) and Schiffmann-Vasserot (2023), we also determine the Maulik-Okounkov Yangian for the case of cyclic quivers. Furthermore, we explain the construction of factorization coproduct, provide evidence for the strong rationality conjecture, calculate the spherical subalgebra of the non-deformed CoHA for any quiver without loops, recover results about the CoHA of compactly supported semistable sheaves on the minimal resolution of the Kleinian singularity $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_{K}$ and identify a commutative algebra inside the additive shuffle algebra associated to the cyclic quiver. We end by conjecturally relating the obtained integral form with the algebra defined by Gaiotto-Rapčák-Zhou, in the context of twisted M-theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 11 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the variety $(k^{n\times n})^{p}$ under the action of $GL_{n}$ by simultaneous similarity. We define discrete and continuous invariants which completely determine the orbits. The discrete invariants induce a disjoint decomposition of the variety into finitely many locally closed $GL_{n}$-stable subsets and for each of these we construct finitely many invariant morphisms to $k$ separating the orbits. The complicated action of $GL_{n}$ by similarity is reduced to left multiplication of a product of $GL_{l_{i}}$'s on a product of $k^{l_{i}\times m_{i}}$'s. An analogous result holds for the left-right action of $GL_{m}\times GL_{n}$ on $(k^{m\times n })^{p}$ and more general for all varieties of finite dimensional modules over some finitely generated algebra.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 49 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish improved bounds for bilinear forms with Kloosterman fractions of the form ${\sum\sum}_{m,n} α_m β_n e(a\overline{m}/(bn))$ with $M<m\le 2M$, $N < n \le 2N$ and $(m,n)=1$. Our approach works directly with arbitrary coefficient sequences $(α_m), (β_n) \in \mathbb{C}$, avoiding the temporary restriction to squarefree support used in prior work. While this requires handling additional arithmetic complexity, it yields strictly stronger bounds that improve upon the estimates of Duke, Friedlander, and Iwaniec \cite{DFI} and Bettin-Chandee \cite{BC}; in the balanced case $M \approx N$, the new saving over the trivial bound is $1/12$%, compared to $1/48$ in \cite{DFI} . As an application, we prove a generalized asymptotic formula for the twisted second moment of the Riemann zeta-function with Dirichlet polynomials of length $T^{1/2+δ}$ for $δ= 1/46$, extending beyond the previously limiting $θ= 1/2$ barrier established by Bettin, Chandee, and Radziwiłł \cite{BCR}. We also establish bounds for related Hermitian sums involving Salié-type exponential phases and develop techniques for more general bilinear forms with Kloosterman fractions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be prime number and $K$ be a $p$-adic field. We systematically compute the higher $\mathrm{Ext}$-groups between locally analytic generalized Steinberg representations (LAGS for short) of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ via a new combinatorial treatment of some spectral sequences arising from the so-called Tits complex. Such spectral sequences degenerate at the second page and each $\mathrm{Ext}$-group admits a canonical filtration whose graded pieces are terms in the second page of the corresponding spectral sequence. For each pair of LAGS, we are particularly interested their $\mathrm{Ext}$-groups in the bottom two non-vanishing degrees. We write down an explicit basis for each graded piece (under the canonical filtration) of such an $\mathrm{Ext}$-group, and then describe the cup product maps between such $\mathrm{Ext}$-groups using these bases. As an application, we generalize Breuil's $\mathscr{L}$-invariants for $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ and Schraen's higher $\mathscr{L}$-invariants for $\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ to $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$. Along the way, we also establish a generalization of Bernstein--Zelevinsky geometric lemma to admissible locally analytic representations constructed by Orlik--Strauch, generalizing a result in Schraen's thesis for $\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{Q}_p)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Though Joyal's species are known to categorify generating functions in enumerative combinatorics, they also categorify zeta functions in algebraic geometry. The reason is that any scheme $X$ of finite type over the integers gives a "zeta species" $Z_X$, and any species $F$ gives a Dirichlet series $\widehat{F}$, in such a way that $\widehat{Z}_X$ is the arithmetic zeta function of $X$, a well-known Dirichlet series that encodes the number of points of $X$ over each finite field. Specifically, a $Z_X$-structure on a finite set is a way of making that set into a semisimple commutative ring, say $k$, and then choosing a $k$-point of the scheme $X$. This is an elaboration of joint work with James Dolan.</p></details>

We show that almost proper varieties, as well as p-adic (weakly admissible) period domains in the sense of Rappoport-Zink belong to this class. In particular, we recover Poincaré duality for almost proper varieties as first established by Li-Reinecke-Zavyalov, and we compute the étale cohomology with $\mathbb{F}_p$-coefficients of p-adic period domains, generalizing a computation of Colmez-Dospinescu-Niziol for Drinfeld's symmetric spaces. The arguments used in this paper rely crucially on Mann's six functors formalism for solid $\mathcal{O}^{+,a}/π$ coefficients.</p></details>

This surface is noted for having the largest known rank 68 for an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{C}(t)$. Our methodology utilizes the known decomposition of the Mordell-Weil Lattice of this surface into Lattices of ten rational elliptic surfaces and one $K3$ surface. We explicitly compute the defining polynomials of the splitting field, which reach degrees of 1728 and 5760, and verify the results via height pairing matrices and specialized symbolic software packages.</p></details>

Let $K/k$ be a Galois extension of number fields with Galois group isomorphic to $G$, and let $C \subseteq \mathrm{Gal}(K/k) \simeq G$ be a conjugacy invariant subset. It is well known that there exists an unramified prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $k$ with Frobenius element lying in $C$ and norm satisfying $\mathrm{N}\mathfrak{p} \ll |\mathrm{Disc}(K)|^α$ for some constant $α= α(G,C)$. There is a rich literature establishing unconditional admissible values for $α$, with most approaches proceeding by studying the zeros of $L$-functions. We give an alternative approach, not relying on zeros, that often substantially improves this exponent $α$ for any fixed finite group $G$, provided $C$ is a union of rational equivalence classes. As a particularly striking example, we prove that there exist absolute constants $c_1,c_2 > 0$ such that for any $n\geq 2$ and any conjugacy class $C \subset S_n$, one may take $α(S_n,C) = c_1 \exp(-c_2n)$.

Beyond this classification, we examine the main characteristics of these representations, particularly their irreducibility and faithfulness. More deeply, we show that all such representations are reducible, and most of them are unfaithful. Also, we find necessary and sufficient conditions of the first two types of the classified representations of $T_n$ to be irreducible in the case $n=4$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>To every finite-dimensional $\mathbb C$-algebra $Λ$ of finite representation type we associate an affine variety. These varieties are a large generalization of the varieties defined by "$u$ variables" satisfying "$u$-equations", first introduced in the context of open string theory and moduli space of ordered points on the real projective line by Koba and Nielsen, rediscovered by Brown as "dihedral co-ordinates", and recently generalized to any finite type hereditary algebras. We show that each such variety is irreducible and admits a rational parametrization. The assignment is functorial: algebra quotients correspond to monomial maps among the varieties. The non-negative real part of each variety has boundary strata that are controlled by Jasso reduction. These non-negative parts naturally define a generalization of open string integrals in physics, exhibiting factorization and splitting properties that do not come from a worldsheet picture. We further establish a family of Rogers dilogarithm identities extending results of Chapoton beyond the Dynkin case.</p></details>

As an application, for each positive integer $n$, we determine the list of possible numbers of cyclic $n$-isogenies an elliptic curve over some number field can admit. Similarly, for an odd prime power $p^k$, we calculate the possible values for the number of points above some $j$-invariant on Cartan modular curves $X_{\mathrm s}(p^k)$, $X_{\mathrm{ns}}(p^k)$ and their normalizers. Combining known results about images of Galois representations of CM elliptic curves with our work, we also devise a simple algorithm to determine the number of rational CM points on any modular curve.</p></details>

We parametrize all composition algebras over the field $k$ in terms of the orbits in some of these representations. This leads to a parametric description of the reduced Freudenthal algebras of dimensions $6$ and $9$ over $k$ (if $\text{char}(k)\neq 2,3$).

Let $N$ be the unipotent radical of the maximal parabolic subgroup $P$ of $GL_{2n}(F)$ corresponding to the partition $(n,n).$ In this article, we describe the structure of the twisted Jacquet module $π_{N,ψ}$ of $π$ with respect to $N$ and a non-degenerate character $ψ$ of $N.$ We also provide a necessary and sufficient condition for $π_{N,ψ}$ to be non-zero and show that the twisted Jacquet module is non-zero under certain assumptions on the inducing data. As an application of our results, we obtain the structure of twisted Jacquet modules of certain non-generic irreducible representations of $GL_{2n}(F)$ and establish the existence of their Shalika models.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we generalize the following problem, which is called the rational angle bisection problem, to the $n$-dimensional space $k^n$ over a subfield $k$ of $\mathbb R$: on the coordinate plane, for which rational numbers $a$ and $b$ are the slopes of the angle bisectors between two lines with slopes $a$ and $b$ rational? First, we give a few characterizations of when the angle bisectors between two lines with direction vectors in $k^n$ have direction vectors in $k^n.$ To find solutions to the problem in the case when $k = \mathbb Q,$ we also give a formula for the integral solutions of $x_1{}^2+\dots +x_n{}^2 = dx_{n+1}{}^2,$ which is a generalization of the negative Pell's equation $x^2-dy^2 = -1,$ where $d$ is a square-free positive integer. Second, by applying the above characterizations, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the incenter of a given $n$-simplex with $k$-rational vertices to be $k$-rational. On the coordinate plane, we prove that every triangle with $k$-rational vertices and incenter can be obtained by scaling a triangle with $k$-rational side lengths and area, which is a generalization of a Heronian triangle. We also state certain fundamental properties of a few centers of a given triangle with $k$-rational vertices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study \emph{unimodular fake} $μ's$, i.e. multiplicative functions $\mathfrak f: \N \to \mathbb{S}^1 \cup \{0\} $ determined by a fixed sequence $\{\varepsilon_k\}_{k\ge 0} \subset \mathbb{S}^1 \, \cup \, \{0\}$ via the rule $\mathfrak f(p^k)=\varepsilon_k$ for every prime $p$ and $k \ge 0$. The Dirichlet series of a given $\mathfrak f$ admits the Euler product $$ F_{\mathfrak f}(s)=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\mathfrak f(n)}{n^s} =\prod_p g_{\mathfrak f}(p^{-s}),\qquad g_{\mathfrak f}(u)=\sum_{k\ge0}\varepsilon_k u^k, $$ and the canonical zeta-factorization $$ F_{\mathfrak f}(s)=ζ(s)^{\,z}\,ζ(2s)^{\,w}\,G_{\mathfrak f}(s), \qquad z=\varepsilon_1,\ \ w=\varepsilon_2-\frac{\varepsilon_1(\varepsilon_1+1)}{2}, $$ where $G_{\mathfrak f}(s)$ is a holomorphic Euler product on $\Re s>1/3$. Assuming the Riemann hypothesis and Simple Zeros Conjecture, we derive an explicit formula for $A_{\mathfrak f}^{\exp}(x)= \sum_{n \ge 1} \mathfrak f(n) \, e^{-n/x} $ of the form $$ A_{\mathfrak f}^{\exp}(x) -Δ_1(x;z,w) = Δ_{1/2}(x;z,w)\;+\;\sum_ρΔ_ρ(x;z,w,\mathfrak f)\;+\;\mathcal E(x). $$ To our knowledge, our expansion is the first extension of the Selberg-Delange method for Dirichlet series of the form $ζ(s)^{\,z}\,ζ(2s)^{\,w}\,G(s)$ that, beyond the main term from $s=1$, also extracts lower-order contributions from the singularities on the critical line $\Re(s)=1/2$. On the other hand, we introduce a notion of \emph{bias} at the natural scale $x^{1/2}(\Log x)^{w-1}$ and obtain an explicit criterion distinguishing \emph{persistent}, \emph{apparent}, and \emph{unbiased} behavior in this regime.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a finite field, let $f$ be a function from $F$ to $F$, and let $a$ be a nonzero element of $F$. The discrete derivative of $f$ in direction $a$ is $Δ_a f \colon F \to F$ with $(Δ_a f)(x)=f(x+a)-f(x)$. The differential spectrum of $f$ is the multiset of cardinalities of all the fibers of all the derivatives $Δ_a f$ as $a$ runs through $F^*$. An almost perfect nonlinear (APN) function is one for which the largest cardinality in its differential spectrum is $2$. Almost perfect nonlinear functions are of interest as cryptographic primitives. If $d$ is a positive integer, then the power function over $F$ with exponent $d$ is the function $f \colon F \to F$ with $f(x)=x^d$ for every $x \in F$. There is a small number of known infinite families of APN power functions. In this paper, we re-express the exponents for one such family in a more convenient form. This enables us not only to obtain the differential spectrum of each power function $f$ with an exponent in our family, but also to determine the elements that lie in an arbitrary fiber of the discrete derivative of $f$. This differential analysis, which is far more detailed than previous results, is achieved by composing the discrete derivative of $f$ with some permutations and a double covering of its domain to obtain a function whose fibers can more readily be analyzed.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Kadar--Yu algebras are a physically motivated sequence of towers of algebras interpolating between the Brauer algebras and Temperley--Lieb algebras. The complex representation theory of the Brauer and Temperley--Lieb algebras is now fairly well understood, with each connecting in a different way to Kazhdan--Lusztig theory. The semisimple representation theory of the KY algebras is also understood, and thus interpolates, for example, between the double-factorial and Catalan combinatorial realms. However the non-semisimple representation theory has remained largely open, being harder overall than the (already challenging) Brauer case. In this paper we determine generalised Chebyshev-like forms for the determinants of gram matrices of contravariant forms for standard modules. This generalises the root-of-unity paradigm for Temperley--Lieb algebras (and many related algebras); interpolating in various ways between this and the `integral paradigm' for Brauer algebras. The standard module gram determinants give a huge amount of information about morphisms between standard modules, making thorough use of the powerful homological machinery of towers of recollement (ToR), with appropriate gram determinants providing the ToR `bootstrap'. As for the Brauer and TL cases the representation theory has a strongly alcove-geometric flavour, but the KY cases guide an intriguing generalisation of the overall geometric framework.</p></details>

Given an imaginary root $β$, we show that $R_α(β)=\{β\}$ or $R_α(β)$ is infinite. If $(β,β)<0$, we also show that the multiplicity of the root ${α+nβ}$ grows at least exponentially as $n\to\infty$. If $(β,β)=(α, β) = 0$, we show that $R_α(β)$ is bi-infinite and the multiplicities of $α+nβ$ are bounded. If $(β,β)=0$ and $(α, β) \neq 0$, we show that $R_α(β)$ is semi-infinite and the muliplicity of $α+nβ$ or $α-nβ$ grows faster than every polynomial as $n\to\infty$. We also prove that $\dim \mathfrak{g}_{α+β} \geq \dim \mathfrak{g}_α+ \dim \mathfrak{g}_β-1$ whenever $α\neq β$ with $(α, β)<0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be an affine or hyperbolic rank 2 Kac--Moody group over a finite field $\mathbb F_q$. Let $X=X_{q+1}$ be the Tits building of $G$, the $(q+1)$--homogeneous tree, and let $Γ$ be a non-uniform lattice in $G$. When $Γ$ is a standard parabolic subgroup for the negative $BN$--pair, we define Eisenstein series on $Γ\backslash X$ and prove its convergence in a half space using Iwasawa decomposition of the Haar measure on $G$. A crucial tool is a description of the vertices of $X$ in terms of Iwasawa cells. We also prove meromorphic continuation of the Eisenstein series. This requires us to construct an integral operator on the Tits building $X$ and a truncation operator for the Eisenstein series. We also develop the functional analytic framework necessary for proving meromorphic continuation in our setting, by refining and extending Bernstein's Continuation Principle.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field or a finite field. In this article, we obtain an explicit and complete set of double coset representatives for $S\backslash GL_{2n}(F)/Q$ where $S$ is the Shalika subgroup and $Q$ a maximal parabolic subgroup of the group $GL_{2n}(F)$ of invertible $2n\times 2n$ matrices. We compute the cardinality of $S\backslash GL_{2n}(F)/Q$ and also give an alternate perspective on the double cosets arising intrinsically from certain subgroups which are relevant for applications in representation theory. Finally, if $Q$ is a maximal parabolic subgroup of the type $(r,2n-r),$ we prove that $S\backslash GL_{2n}(F)/Q$ is in one to one correspondence with $ΔS_n\backslash S_{2n}/S_{r}\times S_{2n-r}$ leading to a Bruhat decomposition. The results and proofs discussed in this article are valid over any arbitrary field $F$ even though our motivation is from representation theory of $p$-adic and finite linear groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a condensable algebra in a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$. We define an action of the fusion category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ on the morphism space $\mbox{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(x,A)$ for any $x$ in $\mathcal{C}$, whose characters are generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of the Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\mathcal{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\mathcal{B}$ to $A^\mathcal{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOAs, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\mathcal{C}_A}$ where $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{M}_U$ is the category of $U$-modules. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\mathcal{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$</p></details>

We prove new cases of these conjectures in codimensions five and six by reframing the conjectures as arithmetic problems in the Boij-Söderberg cone. In this setting, potential counterexamples correspond to explicit Diophantine obstructions arising from the numerics of pure resolutions. Using number-theoretic methods, we completely classify these obstructions in the codimension three case revealing some delicate connections between Betti tables, commutative algebra and classical Diophantine equations. The new results in codimensions five and six concern Gorenstein algebras where a study of the variety determined by these Diophantine equations is sufficient to resolve the conjecture in this case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates finiteness conditions for gentle and skew-gentle algebras. First, we prove that a skew-gentle algebra is $τ$-tilting finite if and only if it is representation-finite, which extends the result for gentle algebras by Plamondon (2019). Second, using surface models, we characterize silting-discreteness for the perfect derived categories of graded gentle and skew-gentle algebras. Specifically, for a graded gentle algebra, silting-discreteness is equivalent to its associated surface being of genus zero with non-zero winding numbers for all simple closed curves. We further extend this geometric characterization to graded skew-gentle algebras via orbifold surface models.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A subspace $U$ of $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ is called \textit{cyclically covering} if the whole space $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ is the union of the cyclic shifts of $U$. The case $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ itself is the only covering subspace, is of particular interest. Recently, Huang solved this problem completely under the condition $\gcd(n, q)=1$ using primitive idempotents and trace functions, and explicitly posed the non-coprime case as an open question. This paper provides a complete answer to Huang's question. We prove that if $n = p^k m$ where $p = \mathrm{char}(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $\gcd(m, p)=1$, then $h_q(p^k m) = 0$ if and only if $h_q(m) = 0$. This result fully reduces the non-coprime case to the coprime case settled by Huang. Our proof employs the structure theory of cyclic group algebras in modular characteristic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $n\geq 2$ be an integer, $p$ be a prime number and $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Motivated by Schraen's thesis and Gehrmann's definition of automorphic simple $\mathscr{L}$-invariants, we study the first non-vanishing extension groups between a pair of locally $K$-analytic generalized Steinberg representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$. We study subspaces of these extension groups defined by using either relative conditions with respect to Lie subalgebras of $\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{l}_{n}$ (isomorphic to $\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{l}_{m}$ for some $2\leq m<n$) or maps between locally $K$-analytic generalized Steinberg representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ with different highest weights. The applications of these computations are two-fold. On one hand, we prove that a certain universal successive extension of filtered $(\varphi,N)$-modules can be realized as the space of homomorphisms from a suitable shift of the dual of locally $K$-analytic Steinberg representation into the de Rham complex of the Drinfeld upper-half space, generalizing one main result of Schraen's thesis from $\mathrm{GL}_{3}(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ to $\mathrm{GL}_{n}(K)$. On the other hand, we give a definition of higher $\mathscr{L}$-invariants for $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ (which we call Breuil-Schraen $\mathscr{L}$-invariants) and discuss its possible explicit relation to Fontaine-Mazur $\mathscr{L}$-invariants, using ideas from Breuil-Ding's higher $\mathscr{L}$-invariants for $\mathrm{GL}_{3}(\mathbb{Q}_p)$.</p></details>

Building upon the recent work by Erdős \emph{et al}, which proved the graphic nature of \( \mathrm{PD}_n \) for large \( n \) unconditionally, and for all \( n \) under RH, we provide the first explicit unconditional threshold such that:\\ (1) For all \( n \geq \exp\exp(30.5) \), \( \mathrm{PD}_n \) is graphic.\\ (2) For all \( n \geq \exp\exp(34.5) \), every realization \( G_n \) of \( \mathrm{PD}_n \) satisfies that \( (G_n, p_{n+1}-p_n) \) is DPG-graphic. Our proofs utilize a more refined criterion for when a sequence is graphic, and better estimates for the first moment of large prime gaps proven through an explicit zero-free region and explicit zero-density estimate for the Riemann zeta function.</p></details>

> **Comment:** V3: abstract revised

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Raimi's theorem guarantees the existence of a partition of $\mathbb{N}$ into two parts with an unavoidable intersection property: for any finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, some color class intersects both parts infinitely many times, after an appropriate shift (translation). We establish a polynomial extension of this result, proving that such intersections persist under polynomial shifts in any dimension. Let $P^{(1)},\dots,P^{(f)}\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ be non-constant polynomials with positive leading coefficients and $P^{(j)}(0)=0$ for every $j$. We construct a partition of $\mathbb{N}^k$ into an arbitrarily fixed finite number of pieces such that for any coloring of $\mathbb{N}^k$ with finitely many colors, there exist $x_0\in \mathbb{N}$ and a single color class that meets all partition pieces after shifts by $x_0+P^{(j)}(h)$ in each of the $k$ coordinate directions, for every $j$ and infinitely many values $h\in \mathbb{N}$. Our proof exploits Weyl's equidistribution theory, Pontryagin duality, and the structure of polynomial relation lattices. We also prove some finite analogues of the above results for abelian groups and $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For large enough (but fixed) prime powers $q$, and trace functions to squarefree moduli in $\mathbb{F}_q[u]$ with slopes at most $1$ at infinity, and no Artin--Schreier factors in their geometric global monodromy, we come close to square-root cancellation in short sums. A special case is a function field version of Hooley's Hypothesis $R^*$ for short Kloosterman sums. As a result, we are able to make progress on several problems in analytic number theory over $\mathbb{F}_q[u]$ such as Mordell's problem on the least residue class not represented by a polynomial and the variance of short Kloosterman sums.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the cohomology ring $H^*(U,\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$ for $U=X\setminus S$ where $X$ is the spectrum of the ring of integers of a number field $K$ and $S$ is a finite set of finite primes. As a consequence, we obtain an efficient way to compute presentations of $Q_2(G_S)$, where $G_S$ is Galois group of the maximal extension of $K$ unramified outside of a finite set of primes $S$, for varying $K$. This includes the following cases (for $p$ any prime dividing $n$): $μ_p(\overline{K}) \not\subseteq K$; $S$ does not contain the primes above $p$; and $p=2$ with $K$ admitting real archimedean places. We also show how to recover the classical reciprocity law of the Legendre symbol from the graded commutativity of the cup product.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study when Poincaré series for congruence subgroups do not vanish identically. We show that almost all Poincaré series with suitable parameters do not vanish when either the weight $k$ or the index $m$ varies in a dyadic interval. Crucially, analyzing the problem `on average' over these weights or indices allows us to prove non-vanishing in ranges where the index $m$ is significantly larger than $k^2$ - a range in which proving non-vanishing for individual Poincaré series remains out of reach of current methods.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study various categories of Whittaker modules over the queer Lie superalgebras $\mathfrak q(n)$. We formulate standard Whittaker modules and reduce the problem of composition factors of these standard Whittaker modules to that of Verma modules in the BGG categories $\mathcal O$ of $\mathfrak q(n)$. We also obtain an analogue of Losev-Shu-Xiao decomposition for the finite $W$-superalgebras $U(\mathfrak q(n), E)$ of $\mathfrak q(n)$ associated to an odd nilpotent element $E\in \mathfrak q(n)_{\bar{1}}$. As an application, we establish several equivalences of categories of Whittaker $\mathfrak q(n)$-modules and analogues of BGG category of $U(\mathfrak q(n), E)$-modules. In particular, we reduce the multiplicity problem of Verma modules over $U(\mathfrak q(n), E)$ to that of the Verma modules in the BGG categories $\mathcal O$ of $\mathfrak q(n)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 26 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we discover a secondary term in the asymptotic formula for the mean value of Hecke--Maass special $L$-values $ L (1/2+it_f, f) $ with the average over $f (z)$ in an orthonormal basis of (even or odd) Hecke--Maass cusp forms of Laplace eigenvalue $1/4 + t_f^2$ ($t_f > 0$). To be explicit, we prove $$ \sum_{t_f \leqslant T} ω_f L (1/2+it_f, f) = \frac {T^2} {π^2} + \frac {8T^{3/2}} {3π^{3/2} } + O \big(T^{1+\varepsilon}\big), $$ for any $\varepsilon > 0$, where $ω_f$ are the harmonic weights. This provides a new instance of (large) secondary terms in the moments of $L$-functions -- it was known previously only for the smoothed cubic moment of quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions. The proof relies on an explicit formula for the smoothed mean value of $L (1/2+it_f, f)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we resolve a conjecture of Zhi-Wei Sun concerning the integrality and arithmetic structure of certain trigonometric determinants. Our approach builds on techniques developed in our previous work, where trigonometric determinants were studied via special values of Dirichlet $L$-functions. The method is refined by establishing a connection between odd characters modulo $4n$ and even characters modulo $n$. The results highlight a close connection between trigonometric determinant matrices, Fourier-analytic structures, and arithmetic invariants.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 26 ppages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the approximation error $\varepsilon(x)=\mathrm{li}_{*}(x)-\mathrm{li}(x)$ arising from the classical Stieltjes asymptotic expansion for the logarithmic integral. Our analysis is based on the discrete values $\varepsilon_k=\varepsilon(e^{k})$ and their increments $Δ_k=\varepsilon_{k+1}-\varepsilon_k,$ for which we derive new unconditional analytic bounds. Using precise integral representations for each increment $Δ_k$, together with sharp upper and lower estimates for the associated kernel integrals, we obtain computable and uniform bounds for $\varepsilon_k$ for all $k\ge 1$, and hence for $\varepsilon(x)$ for all $x\ge e$. We prove the following unconditional bounds: $$\begin{array}{l} \displaystyle \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{\frac{2π}{\ln(x)}} + o\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\ln(x)}}\right) \le \varepsilon(x) \le \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{\frac{2π}{\ln(x)}} + o\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\ln(x)}}\right) \text{for all } e \le x \le e^{1000}, \end{array} $$ $$\begin{array}{l} \displaystyle \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{\frac{2π}{\ln(x)}} + o\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\ln(x)}}\right) - C_{l} \le \varepsilon(x) \le \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{\frac{2π}{\ln(x)}} + o\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\ln(x)}}\right) + C_{r} \text{for all } x>e^{1000} \text{ with } C_{l} = 0.0000035462\text{ and } C_{r}=0.0000021511. \end{array}$$ These results establish the first fully explicit global bounds for the Stieltjes approximation error. Finally, our findings strongly support the conjectural behaviour: $$ \varepsilon(x) = \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{\frac{2π}{\ln(x)}} + o\!\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\ln(x)}}\right), \qquad x\ge e. $$</p></details>
