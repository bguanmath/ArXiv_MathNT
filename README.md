<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article we study the value distribution theory for the first derivative of the logarithmic derivative of Dirichlet $L$-functions, generalizing certain results of Ihara, Matsumoto et. al. related to ``$M$-functions" for $σ= $ Re$(s) > 1$. We then discuss how things evolve for higher derivatives.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ivan Damnjanović &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A nut graph is a nontrivial simple graph whose adjacency matrix has a simple eigenvalue zero such that the corresponding eigenvector has no zero entries. It is known that the order $n$ and degree $d$ of a vertex-transitive nut graph satisfy $4 \mid d$, $d \ge 4$, $2 \mid n$ and $n \ge d + 4$; or $d \equiv 2 \pmod 4$, $d \ge 6$, $4 \mid n$ and $n \ge d + 6$. Here, we prove that for each such $n$ and $d$, there exists a $d$-regular Cayley nut graph of order $n$. As a direct consequence, we obtain all the pairs $(n, d)$ for which there is a $d$-regular vertex-transitive (resp. Cayley) nut graph of order $n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a number field. Let $π_1,π_2$ be cuspidal automorphic representations of $GL_2(\mathbb{A}_F)$, and let $π$ be a cuspidal automorphic representation of either $GL_2(\mathbb{A}_F)$ or $GL_3(\mathbb{A}_F)$. When $(π_1,π_2,π)$ is of general type, we show that the triple product $L$-function $L(s,π_1 \times π_2 \times π)$ on either $GL(2) \times GL(2) \times GL(2)$ or $GL(2) \times GL(2) \times GL(3)$ has a standard zero-free region with no exceptional Landau-Siegel zero. Moreover, when $(π_1,π_2,π)$ is not of general type, we give precise conditions when $L(s,π_1 \times π_2 \times π)$ could possibly have exceptional Landau-Siegel zeros.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 16 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a natural number with $k\ge 2$, and let $\varepsilon>0$. We consider the number $V_k^*(P)$ of integral solutions of the system of simultaneous Diophantine equations $$ x_1^{2j-1}+\ldots +x_{k+1}^{2j-1}=y_1^{2j-1}+\ldots +y_{k+1}^{2j-1}\quad (1\le j\le k), $$ with $1\le x_i,y_i\le P$ $(1\le i\le k+1)$. Writing $L_k^*(P)$ for the number of diagonal solutions with $\{x_1,\ldots ,x_{k+1}\}=\{y_1,\ldots ,y_{k+1}\}$, so that $L_k^*(P)\sim (k+1)!P^{k+1}$, we prove that $$ V_k^*(P)-L_k^*(P)\ll P^{\sqrt{8k+9}-1+\varepsilon}. $$ This establishes a strong paucity result improving on earlier work of Brüdern and Robert.</p></details>

> **Comment:** revised version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cases of Deligne's companion conjecture for normal schemes over finite fields have been proven by L. Lafforgue, Drinfeld, and Zheng in recent years: L. Lafforgue proved the conjecture for curves, Drinfeld proved the conjecture for all smooth schemes and later also for representations valued in a reductive group, and Zheng proved Deligne's conjecture for smooth Artin stacks. In this paper, we extend Drinfeld's theorem for general reductive groups to smooth Artin stacks of finite presentation and apply the result to the study of compatibility of the canonical $\ell$-adic local systems on Shimura stacks.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jia Li, Ce Xu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 29 pages, Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we employ contour integration and residue calculus to derive explicit parity formulas for (cyclotomic) multiple zeta values (MZVs). A key innovation lies in applying double shuffle regularization to the contour integrals, which leads to two distinct regularized parity formulas-one via shuffle and one via stuffle regularization. Notably, this demonstrates for the first time that the contour integral method can be extended to the regularized setting (including the case $k_r=1$), thereby overcoming a limitation of previous approaches. Our results not only provide explicit parity relations at arbitrary depths but also lay the groundwork for extending this technique to other variants of multiple zeta values.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Pedro-José Cazorla García, Lucas Villagra Torcomian &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 38 pages, to appear in Research in Number Theory

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In his breakthrough article, Darmon presented a program to study Generalized Fermat Equations (GFE) via abelian varieties of $\text{GL}_2$-type over totally real fields. So far, only Jacobians of some Frey hyperelliptic curves have been used with that purpose. In the present article, we show how most of the known Frey hyperelliptic curves are particular instances of a more general biparametric family of hyperelliptic curves $C(z,s)$. Then, we apply the cluster picture methodology to compute the conductor of $C(z,s)$ at all odd places. As a Diophantine application, we specialize $C(z,s)$ in some particular values $z_0$ and $s_0$, and we find the conductor exponent at odd places of the natural Frey hyperelliptic curves attached to $Ax^p+By^p=Cz^r$ and $Ax^r+By^r=Cz^p$, generalizing the results due to Azon, Curcó-Iranzo, Khawaja, Maistret and Mocanu, and opening the door for future research in GFE with coefficients. Moreover, we show how a new Frey hyperelliptic curve for $Ax^2+By^r=Cz^p$ can be constructed in this way, giving new results on the conductor exponents for this equation. Finally, following the recent approach by Golfieri and Pacetti, we consider the Frey representations attached to a general signature $(q,r,p)$ via hypergeometric motives and, using $C(z,s)$, we compute the wild part of the conductor exponent at primes above $q$ and $r$ of the residual representation modulo a prime above $p$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages. All comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X\subseteq \mathbb{P}^3$ be a smooth projective surface of degree $d\ge 4$ defined over a number field $K$, and let $N_{X^{\prime}}(B)$ be the number of rational points of $X$ of height at most $B$ that do not lie on lines contained in $X$. Assuming a suitable hypothesis on the size of the rank of Abelian varieties, we show that $N_{X^{\prime}}(B)\ll_{K,d,\varepsilon} B^{4/3+\varepsilon}$ for any fixed $\varepsilon>0$. This improves an unconditional bound from Salberger for $d=4$ and $d=5$. The proof, based on an argument of Heath-Brown, consists of cutting $X$ by projective planes and using a uniform version of Faltings's Theorem, due to Dimitrov, Gao, and Habegger, to bound the number of rational points on the plane sections of $X$. More generally, we prove that if $X\subseteq \mathbb{P}^n$ is a non-degenerate non-uniruled smooth projective surface defined over $K$, then $N_{X^{\prime}}(B)\ll_{K,n,d,\varepsilon}B^{\frac{n+1}{n}+\varepsilon}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $b(n)$ be the number of partition triples $π=(π_1,π_2,π_3)$ of $n$ such that $π_1$ consists of distinct odd parts, and $π_2$ and $π_3$ consist of parts divisible by $4$. Utilizing modular forms, Lin obtained the generating functions for $b(3n+1)$ and $b(3n+2)$, which yields the congruence $b(3n+2)\equiv 0\pmod{3}$ for all $n\geq 0$. We provide in this note elementary proofs of these generating functions by employing $q$-series manipulations and dissection formulas. We also establish infinite families of internal congruences modulo $3$ for $b(n)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 43 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Hrushovski observed that the new gap principle of Gao-Ge-Kühne is essentially equivalent to the Bogomolov conjecture over arbitrary globally valued fields of characteristic $0$. Building on this observation, we prove a new gap principle for semiabelian varieties by reducing the Bogomolov conjecture for semiabelian varieties to the Bogomolov conjecture for abelian varieties over arbitrary GVFs. This reduction remains valid in positive characteristic; however, the corresponding Bogomolov conjecture for abelian varieties is not yet known in that setting. We prove an unconditional new gap principle in positive characteristic for semiabelian varieties whose abelian quotient is an elliptic curve.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We characterise quantitative semi-uniform stability for $C_0$-semigroups arising from port-Hamiltonian systems, complementing recent works on exponential and strong stability. With the result, we present a simple universal example class of port-Hamiltonian $C_0$-semigroups exhibiting arbitrary decay rates slower than $t^{-1/2}$. The latter is based on results from the theory of Diophantine approximation, as the decay rates will be strongly related to the approximation properties of irrational numbers by rationals obtained from cut-offs of continued fraction expansions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** completely updated by adding infinite families of congruences for $c$-elongated plane partitions; 8 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an integer $c\geq 1$, let $a_c(n)$ count the number of generalized cubic partitions of $n$, which are partitions of $n$ whose even parts may appear in $c$ different colors, and $d_c(n)$ count the number of partitions obtained by adding the links of the $c$-elongated plane partition diamonds of length $n$. We prove in this note infinite families of congruences modulo $7$ and $11$ for $a_c(n)$ and $d_c(n)$ by employing elementary $q$-series techniques. These results generalize particular congruences modulo $7$ and $11$ for $a_c(n)$ and $d_c(n)$ recently found by Dockery, and Baruah, Das, and Talukdar, respectively, using modular forms.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 50 pages, implemented Referee comments

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the present paper we study the central values of additive twists of Maaß forms $L$-series. In the case of the modular group, we show that the additive twists (when averaged over denominators) are asymptotically normally distributed. This supplements the recent work of Petridis--Risager which settled an averaged version of a conjecture of Mazur--Rubin concerning modular symbols. The methods of the present paper combine dynamical input due to Bettin and the first named author with the new fact that the additive twists define quantum modular forms in the sense of Zagier. This latter property is shown for a general discrete, co-finite group with cusps. Our results also has a number of arithmetic applications; in the case of Hecke congruence groups the quantum modularity implies certain reciprocity relations for twisted moments of twisted ${\rm GL}_2$-automorphic $L$-functions, extending results of Conrey and the second named author. In the case of cuspidal Maaß forms for the modular group, we also obtain a calculation of certain wide moments of twists of the $L$-function of the Maaß form.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Submitted and under review

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this study, we introduce the theory of what we call Hecke vector-forms. A Hecke vector-form can be viewed as a vector function representation of some quasiautomorphic form that transforms like an automorphic form on an arbitrarily chosen Hecke triangle group. In other words, because quasiautomorphic forms have complicated transformation behavior when compared with automorphic forms, the construction of a Hecke vector-form is to retrieve a transformation behavior analogous to the simpler, automorphic case. In this way, a Hecke vector-form can be viewed as the vector function analogue of an automorphic form. Since our work is for any quasi-automorphic form over an arbitrary Hecke triangle group, we briefly review the construction of such groups. Furthermore, we review the derivation of the hauptmodul, the automorphic forms, and the normalized quasiautomorphic form of weight 2 for any Hecke triangle group. We then proceed to the theory of Hecke vector-forms and establish the desired transformation behavior with respect to the generators of the associated group. A proof of this fact is strictly elementary, relying on fine properties of binomial coefficients. Lastly, we relate the vector-forms to Hecke automorphic linear differential equations, which are analogues of the frequently researched modular linear differential equations. Our results include Hecke vector-forms of the classical quasimodular forms as the simplest case.</p></details>

We prove a sharp local-to-global principle: for each $p^e\!\parallel n$, the local shape at $p$ is determined by $a\bmod p^{\,e+1}$, and this precision is optimal. Moreover, the global shape is periodic with minimal modulus $$ M(n)=\prod_{p^e\parallel n}p^{\,e+1}=n\cdot\mathrm{rad}(n), $$ providing many applications in the understanding integral bases of pure number fields.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Version 1: 11 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the distribution of $2$-torsion in class groups and narrow class groups of cubic fields and cubic orders subject to prescribed shape conditions. The \emph{shape} of a cubic order in a number field is a natural geometric invariant taking values in the modular surface $\mathbb{H}/\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. Fix a subset $W$ of the modular surface with positive hyperbolic measure and boundary of measure zero. Refining the methods of Bhargava and Varma, we prove that among cubic fields with shape in $W$, the average size of the $2$-torsion subgroup of the class group is $5/4$ for totally real fields and $3/2$ for complex fields, while the average size of the $2$-torsion subgroup of the narrow class group for totally real cubic fields is $2$. We also obtain analogous results for cubic orders satisfying prescribed local conditions at all primes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $χ$ be an idele class character over a number field $F$, and let $π,π'$ be any two cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{A}_F)$. We prove that the Rankin-Selberg $L$-function $L(s,\mathrm{Sym}^2(π)\times(\mathrm{Sym}^2 (π')\otimesχ))$ has a "standard" zero-free region with no exceptional Landau-Siegel zero except possibly when it is divisible by the $L$-function of a real idele class character. In particular, no such zero exists if $π$ is non-dihedral and $π'$ is not a twist of $π$. Until now, this was only known when $π=π'$, $π$ is self-dual, and $χ$ is trivial.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Representations of vertex operator algebras $V$ (VOAs) have numerous applications, including the construction of sheaves of conformal blocks on moduli spaces of curves. For a $V$-module $W = \oplus W_d$, a sequence of associative algebras $\mathfrak{A}_d$ acts on each graded component $W_d$. When these $d$th-mode transition algebras $\mathfrak{A}_d$ are strongly unital - meaning they are unital with units acting as the identity on $W_d$ - the associated sheaves of conformal blocks are vector bundles rather than merely coherent sheaves. This strong unital property, while difficult to verify in practice, has other important implications as well. Here we construct explicit strong units for $L_{\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}(1,0)$, the simple affine VOA for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at level $1$, and establish that mode transition algebras for universal affine VOAs for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ are never strongly unital at any level $k$ not equal to the critical level $-2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide an affine cellular structure on the extended affine Hecke algebra and affine $q$-Schur algebra of type $A_{n-1}$ that is defined over $\mathbb{Z}\left[q^{\pm1}\right]$, that is, without an adjoined $q^{\frac{1}{2}}$. This is with an eye to applications in the representation theory of $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$ for a $p$-adic field $F$ over coefficient rings in which $p$ is invertible but does not have a square root, which have been a topic of recent interest. This is achieved via a renormalisation of the known affine cellular structure over $\mathbb{Z}\left[q^{\pm\frac{1}{2}}\right]$ at each left and right cell, which is chosen to ensure that the diagonal intersections remain subalgebras and that the left and right cells remain isomorphic. We furthermore show that the affine cellular structure on the Schur algebra has idempotence properties which imply finite global dimension, an important ingredient for the applications to representations of $p$-adic groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an abelian length category $\mathcal{A}$ with only finitely many isoclasses of simple objects, we have the wall-chamber structure and the TF equivalence on the dual real Grothendieck group $K_0(\mathcal{A})_\mathbb{R}^*=\mathrm{Hom}_\mathbb{R}(K_0(\mathcal{A})_\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$, which are defined by semistable subcategories and semistable torsion pairs in $\mathcal{A}$ associated to elements $θ\in K_0(\mathcal{A})_\mathbb{R}^*$. In this paper, we introduce the $M$-TF equivalence for each object $M \in \mathcal{A}$ as a systematic way to coarsen the TF equivalence. We show that the set $Σ(M)$ of closures of $M$-TF equivalence classes is a finite complete fan in $K_0(\mathcal{A})_\mathbb{R}^*$, and that $Σ(M)$ is the normal fan of the Newton polytope $\mathrm{N}(M)$ in $K_0(\mathcal{A})_\mathbb{R}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we study a numeral system with a natural base $s \geq 2$ and a redundant alphabet $A_r=\{0,1, \dots, r\}$, where $s \leq r \leq 2s-2$. We investigate the topological, metric, and fractal properties of the set of numbers in the interval $\left[0,\frac{r}{s-1}\right]$ that admit a unique representation $x=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{α_n} {s^n}\equivΔ^{r_s}_{α_1α_2...α_n...}$, $α_n\in A_r$. The criterion for the uniqueness of the number representation is established. It is proved that the Hausdorff--Besicovitch dimension of the set of numbers with a unique representation is equal to $\frac{\ln(2s-r-1)}{\ln s}$. An analysis of the quantity of representations of numbers having purely periodic representations with a simple period (a single-digit period) is carried out. It is proved that the set of numbers that admit a continuum of distinct representations has full Lebesgue measure. Conditions for a number to belong to this set are given in terms of one of its representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Geometric and Topological Deep Learning are rapidly growing research areas that enhance machine learning through the use of geometric and topological structures. Within this framework, Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) have emerged as a powerful class of operators for encoding symmetries and designing efficient, interpretable neural architectures. Originally introduced in Topological Data Analysis, GENEOs have since found applications in Deep Learning as tools for constructing equivariant models with reduced parameter complexity. GENEOs provide a unifying framework bridging Geometric and Topological Deep Learning and include the operator computing persistence diagrams as a special case. Their theoretical foundations rely on group actions, equivariance, and compactness properties of operator spaces, grounding them in algebra and geometry while enabling both mathematical rigor and practical relevance. While a previous representation theorem characterized linear GENEOs acting on data of the same type, many real-world applications require operators between heterogeneous data spaces. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a new representation theorem for linear GENEOs acting between different perception pairs, based on generalized T-permutant measures. Under mild assumptions on the data domains and group actions, our result provides a complete characterization of such operators. We also prove the compactness and convexity of the space of linear GENEOs. We further demonstrate the practical impact of this theory by applying the proposed framework to improve the performance of autoencoders, highlighting the relevance of GENEOs in modern machine learning applications.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an equivalence between filtrations of primitive bialgebras and filtrations of factorizable perverse sheaves, generalizing the results obtained by Kapranov-Schechtman. Under this equivalence, we find that the word length filtration of quantum shuffle algebras as defined in Ellenberg-Tran-Westerland corresponds to the codimension filtration of factorizable perverse sheaves. Furthermore, we find that the geometric weight filtration of factorizable perverse sheaves corresponds to a filtration on quantum shuffle algebras which has not been previously defined in the literature, and we call this the algebraic weight filtration. To apply this to Hurwitz spaces, we prove a comparison theorem between the weight filtrations for Hurwitz spaces over $\mathbb F_p$ and $\mathbb C$, generalizing the comparison theorem of Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland. This allows us to determine the cohomological weights for Hurwitz spaces explicitly using the algebraic weight filtration of the corresponding quantum shuffle algebra. As a consequence, we find that most weights of Hurwitz spaces are smaller than expected from cohomological degree, and we prove explicit nontrivial upper bounds for weights in some cases, such as when $G=S_3$ and $c$ is the conjugacy class of transpositions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish the existence of $N$-point sets in dimension $d$ whose star-discrepancy is bounded above by $2.4631832 \sqrt{\frac{d}{N}}$, where the numerical constant improves upon all previously known bounds. This improvement is obtained by combining a recent result by Gnewuch on bracketing numbers in high dimensions with discrepancy bounds for Hammersley point sets due to Atanassov in dimensions $1 \leq d \leq 4$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A weight $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$-module with finite-dimensional weight spaces is called a cuspidal module, if every root vector of $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$ acts injectively on it. In \cite{LL}, it has been shown that any block with a generalized central character of the cuspidal $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$-module category is equivalent to a block of the category of finite-dimensional modules over the minimal nilpotent finite $W$-algebra $W(e)$ for $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$. In this paper, using a centralizer realization of $W(e)$ and an explicit embedding $W(e)\rightarrow U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$, we show that every finite-dimensional irreducible $W(e)$-module is isomorphic to an irreducible $W(e)$-quotient module of some finite-dimensional irreducible $\mathfrak{gl}_n$-module. As an application, we can give very explicit realizations of all irreducible cuspidal $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$-modules using finite-dimensional irreducible $\mathfrak{gl}_n$-modules, avoiding using the twisted localization method and the coherent family introduced in \cite{M}.</p></details>

We prove that if their derived categories $\mathbf{D}^b(\mathcal{A})$ and $\mathbf{D}^b(\mathcal{B})$ are left triangulated tensor ideals and are equivalent as triangulated $\mathbf{D}^b(\mathcal{C})$-module categories via an equivalence induced by a monoidal triangulated functor $F:\mathbf{D}^b(\mathcal{C})\rightarrow \mathbf{D}^b(\mathcal{D})$, then the original module categories $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are themselves equivalent. We then apply this result to smash product algebras. Furthermore, the localization theory of module categories and triangulated module categories is investigated.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a connection between Drinfeld modules and rank metric codes, focusing on the case of semifield codes. Our framework constructs rank metric codes from linear subspaces of endomorphisms of a Drinfeld module, using tools such as characteristic polynomials on Tate modules and the Chebotarev density theorem. We show that Sheekey's construction [She20] fits naturally into this setting, yielding a short conceptual proof of one of his main results. We then give a new construction of infinite families of semifield codes arising from Drinfeld modules defined over finite fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the first moment of cubic Hecke $L$-functions over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ evaluated at any $s$ inside the critical strip. The first moment for $s<\frac{1}{2}$ is particularly interesting, and we show there is a phase transition at $s=\frac{1}{3}$. This extends the analogue result of David-Meisner for the first moment over function fields. As in their work, the computation of the moment at $s=\frac{1}{3}$ relies on a cancellation between two terms which are a priori not related: a main term of the principal sum which comes from cubes, and the contribution from infinitely many residues of Dirichlet series of cubic Gauss sums to the dual sum. The cancellation also improves the error term and exhibits a secondary term for all $s$. In particular, at $s=\frac{1}{2}$, we prove the existence of a secondary term of size $Q^{5/6}$, where the size of the family is $Q$. We conjecture that a similar behaviour would hold for higher order Hecke $L$-functions attached to $\ell^{th}$ order residue symbols, refining a function field conjecture of David and Meisner. The proof follows the steps of writing $L(s,χ)$ as two finite sums with the approximate functional equation. Two main ingredients are then exploited: the bound on the second moment of $L(1/2+it,χ)$ that follows from Heath-Brown's cubic large sieve, and the deep work of Kubota and Patterson which connects the Dirichlet series of cubic Gauss sums to metaplectic forms, and gives a formula for its residues in terms of the Fourier coefficients of metaplectic theta functions. This is only known for cubic Gauss sums, and not for general Gauss sums of order $\ell\geq 4$.</p></details>

Denote the image set of this polynomial as $V_{f}=\{f(α)\midα\in\mathbb{F}_{q}\}$ and denote the cardinality of this set as $N_{f}$. A much sharper bound for $N_{f}$ is established in this paper. In particular, for any $p\neq 2, 3$, and for nearly every generic quartic polynomial $f \in \mathbb{F}_{q}[x]$, we obtain $$\lvert N_f - \frac{5}{8} q \rvert \leq \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{q} + \frac{3}{4},$$ which holds as a simple corollary of the main result.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Ramanujan's original definition of mock theta functions from 1920 involves their asymptotic behaviors at roots of unity on the boundary of the disk of convergence $|q|<1$. More recently this topic has been related by several authors, including the first author with Ono and Rhoades in 2013, to quantum modular forms, first defined in 2010 by Zagier. In 2021, Lovejoy defined and studied related quantum $q$-series identities, which do not hold as equalities between power series inside the disk $|q|<1$ but which do hold on dense subsets of roots of unity on the boundary. Inspired by this, in our prior joint work from 2024 we further studied quantum $q$-series identities as related to mock theta functions and quantum modular forms; we also defined and studied antiquantum $q$-series identities, between series which are equal inside the disk $|q|<1$ but which hold at dense sets of roots of unity on the boundary for which one of the series diverges and is unnaturally truncated. Here, building from our previous work, we establish antiquantum $q$-series identities for all of Ramanujan's third order mock theta functions. We deduce these results in part by establishing and applying more general identities which are also of independent interest, and by using the theory of modular eta-quotients.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the curves $y^2=x^{2^m} -1$ and $y^2=x^{2^{d}+1}-x$ over the rationals. These curves are related via their associated Jacobian varieties in that the Jacobians of the latter appear as factors of the Jacobians of the former. One of the principal aims of this paper is to fully describe their Sato-Tate groups and distributions by determining generators of the component groups. In order to do this, we first prove the nondegeneracy of the two families of Jacobian varieties via their Hodge groups. We then use results relating Sato-Tate groups and twisted Lefschetz groups of nondegenerate abelian varieties to determine the generators of the associated Sato-Tate groups. The results of this paper add new examples to the literature of families of nondegenerate Jacobian varieties and of noncyclic component groups of Sato-Tate groups. Furthermore, we compute moment statistics associated to the Sato-Tate groups which can be used to verify the equidistribution statement of the generalized Sato-Tate conjecture by comparing them to moment statistics obtained for the traces in the normalized $L$-polynomials of the curves.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we generalize the following problem, which is called the rational angle bisection problem, to the $n$-dimensional space $k^n$ over a subfield $k$ of $\mathbb R$: on the coordinate plane, for which rational numbers $a$ and $b$ are the slopes of the angle bisectors between two lines with slopes $a$ and $b$ rational? First, we give a few characterizations of when the angle bisectors between two lines with direction vectors in $k^n$ have direction vectors in $k^n.$ To find solutions to the problem in the case when $k = \mathbb Q,$ we also give a formula for the integral solutions of $x_1{}^2+\dots +x_n{}^2 = dx_{n+1}{}^2,$ which is a generalization of the negative Pell's equation $x^2-dy^2 = -1,$ where $d$ is a square-free positive integer. Second, by applying the above characterizations, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the incenter of a given $n$-simplex with $k$-rational vertices to be $k$-rational. On the coordinate plane, we prove that every triangle with $k$-rational vertices and incenter can be obtained by scaling a triangle with $k$-rational side lengths and area, which is a generalization of a Heronian triangle. We also state certain fundamental properties of a few centers of a given triangle with $k$-rational vertices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Berry and Tabor conjectured in 1977 that spectra of generic integrable quantum systems have the same local statistics as a Poisson point process. We verify their conjecture in the case of the two-point spectral density for a quantum particle in a three-dimensional box, subject to a Diophantine condition on the domain's proportions. A permissible choice of width, height and depth is for example $1,2^{1/3},2^{-1/3}$. This extends previous work of Eskin, Margulis and Mozes (Annals of Math., 2005) in dimension two, where the problem reduces to the quantitative Oppenheim conjecture for quadratic forms of signature $(2,2)$. The difficulty in three and higher dimensions is that we need to consider the distribution of indefinite forms in shrinking rather than fixed intervals, which we are able to resolve for special diagonal forms of signature $(3,3)$ in various scalings, including a rate of convergence. A key step of our approach is to represent the relevant counting problem as an average of a theta function on $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})^3\backslash\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})^3$ over an expanding family of one-parameter unipotent orbits. The asymptotic behaviour of these unipotent averages follows from Ratner's measure classification theorem and subtle escape of mass estimates.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $γ=0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $δ=0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $γ+δ/e=\mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $γ^{(n)}+δ^{(n)}/e=η^{(n)}$, $n\ge0$ for sequences of constants $γ^{(n)}$, $δ^{(n)}$, and $η^{(n)}$ (given respectively by raw, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). Investigating the $γ^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations (where $γ^{(0)}=1$ and $γ^{(1)}=γ$), we find that at least one of the pair {$γ,γ^{(2)}$} and -- conditional on a realistic conjecture verified for $2\leq n\leq26$ -- at least two of each set {$γ,γ^{(n)},γ^{(n+1)},\ldots,γ^{(2n)}$} are transcendental, implying that the $γ^{(n)}$ are transcendental infinitely often (with analogous results for the sequence $Γ^{(n)}(1)=\left(-1\right)^{n}γ^{\left(n\right)}$). We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $η^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent, and therefore transcendental, for all $n\ge0$, implying that at least one of each pair, {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e$} and {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e,δ^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n\ge1$. Further analysis of the $γ^{(n)}$ and $η^{(n)}$ reveals that the values $δ^{(n)}/e$ are transcendental infinitely often with positive asymptotic density. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tildeδ^{(n)}$ and $\tildeη^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $γ^{(n)}+\tildeδ^{(n)}/e=\tildeη^{(n)}$.</p></details>

Minimal generating sets arising in this context throw many surprises compared to the analogous concept in linear algebra: they can be of different cardinalities. In fact we establish that for a certain family of polynomials over the rationals, we have minimal generating sets of all cardinalities in a certain range and that these are the only possible cardinalities for minimal generating set for such a polynomial. We also study how minimal generating sets behave under multiple transitivity of the Galois group and consequently prove the existence of polynomials with all minimal generating sets of uniformly same cardinality. We also connect minimal generating sets with the concept of root cluster tower of an irreducible polynomial introduced by the second author and Krithika in [8].</p></details>

Such translation formulae, in turn give the meromorphic extension of the Riemann zeta function. In 1954, Apostol extended those identities to establish a family of such similar translation formulae. In this article, we establish many such Ramaswami and Apostol type translation formulae for the Dirichlet series defining the polylogarithm functions. This extended set up has many interesting applications, for example, it allows us to also find some (seemingly new) recurrence relations between the Bernoulli numbers, and use them to deduce some congruence properties of the tangent numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any compactly generated triangulated category we introduce two topological spaces, the shift-spectrum and the shift-homological spectrum. We use them to parametrise a family of thick subcategories of the compact objects, which we call radical. These spaces can be viewed as non-monoidal analogues of the Balmer and homological spectra arising in tensor-triangular geometry: we prove that for monogenic tensor-triangulated categories the Balmer spectrum is a subspace of the shift-spectrum. To construct these analogues we utilise quotients of the module category, rather than the lattice theoretic methods which have been adopted in other approaches. We characterise radical thick subcategories and show in certain cases, such as the perfect derived categories of tame hereditary algebras or monogenic tensor-triangulated categories, that every thick subcategory is radical. We establish a close relationship between the shift-homological spectrum and the set of irreducible integral rank functions, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for every radical thick subcategory to be given by an intersection of kernels of rank functions. In order to facilitate these results, we prove that both spaces we introduce may equivalently be described in terms of the Ziegler spectrum.</p></details>

We show that $F_{r,\pm1}$ is locally-PN with boomerang uniformity $0$ when $p^n \equiv 3 \pmod{8}$. To the best of our knowledge, it is the second known non-PN function class with boomerang uniformity $0$, and the first such example over odd characteristic fields with $p > 3$. Moreover, we show that $F_{r,\pm1}$ is locally-APN with boomerang uniformity at most $2$ when $p^n \equiv 7 \pmod{8}$. We also provide complete classifications of the differential and boomerang spectra of $F_{r,\pm1}$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Previous research on exceptional units has primarily focused on the ring of rational integers or abstract finite rings, often restricted to linear or quadratic constraints. In this paper, we extend the concept of polynomial-type exceptional units to the ring of integers of an arbitrary algebraic number field. We investigate the number of these polynomial-type exceptional units on general algebraic varieties. By employing the Chinese Remainder Theorem and Hensel's lifting technique, we derive an exact counting formula for the number of these exceptional units on a smooth closed subscheme under the assumption of good reduction. Furthermore, using the Lang-Weil inequality, we establish an asymptotic estimate for the counting function. In particular, we prove that for varieties of degree at most two, the error term can be significantly improved, yielding a sharper asymptotic bound.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The action of the cactus group $C_n$ on Young tableaux of a given shape $λ$ goes back to Berenstein and Kirillov and arises naturally in the study of crystal bases and quantum integrable systems. We show that this action is $2$-transitive on standard Young tableaux of the shape $λ$ if and only if $λ$ is not self-transpose and not a single hook. Moreover, we show that in these cases, the image of the cactus group in the permutation group of standard Young tableaux is either the whole permutation group or the alternating group, and prove that both cases are possible for infinitely many $λ$ (though the alternating group is more frequent). As an application, this implies that the Galois group of solutions to the Bethe ansatz in the Gaudin model attached to the Lie group $GL_d$ is, in many cases, at least the alternating group. This also extends the results of Sottile and White on the multiple transitivity of the Galois group of Schubert calculus problems in Grassmannians to many new cases.</p></details>

Based on this, we provide a new proof of the existence of critical stable envelopes on them. Following an idea of Nakajima, we give a sheaf theoretic interpretation of critical stable envelopes by the hyperbolic restriction in the affinization of symmetric quiver varieties. The associativity of hyperbolic restrictions implies the triangle lemma of critical stable envelopes.</p></details>

Since $\det\left(V_n(b)\right)$ equals the geometric sum $1+b+\cdots+b^{n}$, taking determinants yields a finite cosine product evaluation for this quantity. As further consequences, we derive sharp bounds from the extremal eigenvalues, write down explicit eigenvectors with respect to a natural weighted inner product, and obtain a closed formula for $V_n(b)^{-1}$.</p></details>

It generalizes orbit mutations arising from quiver coverings and allows for infinite mutation sequences even when orbit mutations are obstructed.

We call such functions additive Gamma functions (AGFs), recognizing Euler's $Γ(z)$ as the order-1 prototype. Our theory reveals a structural dichotomy: one AGF is expressible as Gamma ratios (regular case), another involves incomplete Gamma (irregular case). AGFs complete a holonomic triangle between P-recursive sequences, additive functional equations, and differential equations, unifying discrete and continuous perspectives under the condition that Gamma factors in asymptotics have integer slopes.</p></details>
