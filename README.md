### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05272v1'>2509.05272</a>\]&nbsp; **Simultaneously bounded and dense orbits for commuting Cartan actions**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Dmitry Kleinbock, Chengyang Wu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DS &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we prove that the set of points that have bounded orbits under one regular diagonal flow and dense orbits under the other diagonal flow commuting with the first one has full Hausdorff dimension in $X_3=\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$. To explain its application towards the Uniform Littlewood's Conjecture proposed in \cite{BFK25}, we introduce the concept of ``fiberwise nondivergence'' for the action of a cone inside the full diagonal subgroup. Then our main result implies that there exists a dense subset of $X_3$ in which each point has a fiberwise non-divergent orbit under a cone inside the full diagonal subgroup and an unbounded orbit under every diagonal flow.</p></details>

We prove that there exists an absolute constant $c\geqslant 1/12$ such that $$\min_t f_A(t)\leqslant -\Omega(n^c),$$ establishing polynomial bounds for the Chowla cosine problem.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Bernd C. Kellner &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages, 6 tables

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that Wilson's theorem as well as the Wilson quotient can be described by supercongruences modulo any higher prime power involving terms of power sums of Fermat quotients. The new approach uses Bell polynomials and Newton's identities relating elementary symmetric polynomials to power sums. This enables us to compute certain multivariate polynomials recursively that are needed to establish the supercongruences. Subsequently, we give a recurrence formula for these polynomials and show further properties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study meromorphic functions solutions of linear shift difference equations in coefficients in $\mathbb{C}(x)$ involving the operator $\rho: y(x)\mapsto y(x+h)$, for some $h\in \mathbb{C}^*$. We prove that if $f$ is solution of an algebraic differential equation, then $f$ belongs to a ring that is made with periodic functions and exponentials. Our proof is based on the parametrized difference Galois theory initiated by Hardouin and Singer.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the split Grothendieck group $K^{\rm sp}_{0}(\mathcal{M})$ of a $d$-rigid subcategory $\mathcal{M}$ in an extriangulated category $\mathscr{C}$. As applications, we prove the following results: (1) If $\mathcal{M}$ is a silting subcategory, then the Grothendieck group $K_{0}(\mathscr{C})$ is isomorphic to $K_{0}^{\rm sp}(\mathcal{M})$; (2) If $\mathcal{M}$ is a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory, then $K_{0}(\mathscr{C})$ is isomorphic to the index Grothendieck group $K_{0}^{\rm in}(\mathcal{M})$; (3) Let $\mathcal{C}_{A_{n}}^{d}$ be the $d$-cluster category of type $A_n$. If $d$ is even, then $K_0(\mathcal{C}_{A_{n}}^{d})\cong \mathbb{Z}/(n+1)\mathbb{Z}$. If $d$ is odd, then $K_0(\mathcal{C}_{A_{n}}^{d})\cong \mathbb{Z}$ if $n$ is odd; $K_0(\mathcal{C}_{A_{n}}^{d})\cong 0$ if $n$ is even.</p></details>

> **Comment:** survey article, 38 pages, 3 tables, 208 references. We took around 30 suggestions of the two referees into account. To appear in Expositiones Mathematicae

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Ramanujan, in his famous first letter to Hardy, claimed a very precise estimate for the number of integers that can be written as a sum of two squares. Far less well-known is that he also made further claims of a similar nature for the non-divisibility of the Ramanujan tau-function for certain primes. In this survey, we provide more historical details and also discuss related later developments. These show that, as so often, Ramanujan was an explorer in a fascinating wilderness, leaving behind him a beckoning trail.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04997v1'>2509.04997</a>\]&nbsp; **Depth Preservation and Close-Field Transfer in the Local Langlands Correspondence**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Manish Mishra &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 48 page; comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a revised notion of depth for Langlands parameters for a connected reductive $G$ defined over a nonarchimedean local field $F$ that restores depth preservation under the local Langlands correspondence (LLC) -- in particular for all tori. We leverage that preservation to derive structural results that, taken together, yield a canonical transfer of broad harmonic-analytic results from characteristic $0$ to characteristic $p$. When $F$ has suitably large positive characteristic, we prove a block-by-block equivalence: each Bernstein block of $G(F)$ is equivalent to a corresponding block for some $G'(F')$ with $F'$ of characteristic $0$ $\ell$-close to $F$; using this, we show that an LLC in characteristic $0$ corresponds canonically to an LLC in characteristic $p$. For regular supercuspidals we give a direct, more structured construction via Kaletha. Along the way we recover and extend results on $\ell$-close fields -- introducing a depth-transfer function generalizing the normalized Hasse--Herbrand function, proving truncated isomorphisms for arbitrary tori and parahorics, establishing a depth- and supercuspidality-preserving Kazhdan-type Hecke-algebra isomorphism for arbitrary maximal parahorics of arbitrary connected reductive groups; and a generalized Cartan decomposition for arbitrary maximal parahorics -- thereby subsuming several earlier results in the literature. Collectively, the results let one work in characteristic $0$ without loss of generality for a wide swath of harmonic analysis on $p$-adic groups.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hongxing Chen, Changchang Xi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 11 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by understanding the Nakayama conjecture which states that algebras of infinite dominant dimension should be self-injective, we study self-orthogonal modules with virtually Gorenstein endomorphism algebras and prove the following result: Given a finitely generated, self-orthogonal module over an Artin algebra with an orthogonal condition on its Nakayama translation, if its endomorphism algebra is virtually Gorenstein, then the module is projective. As a consequence, we re-obtain a recent result: the Nakayama conjecture holds true for the class of strongly Morita, virtually Gorenstein algebras. Finally, we show that virtually Gorenstein algebras can be constructed from Frobenius extensions.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04978v1'>2509.04978</a>\]&nbsp; **On the Quadratic Structure of Torsors over Affine Group Schemes**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Philippe Cassou-Noguès, Martin J. Taylor &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{G}=\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ be a finite and flat group scheme over the ring of algebraic integers $R$ of a number field $K$ and suppose that the generic fiber of $\mathcal{G}$ is the constant group scheme over $K$ for a finite group $G$. Then the $R$-dual $A^D$of $A$ identifies as a Hopf $R$-order in the group algebra $K[G]$. If $B$ is a principal homogeneous space for $A$, then it is known that $B$ is a locally free $A^D$-module. By multiplying the trace form of $B_K/K$ by a certain scalar we obtain a $G$-invariant form $Tr'_B$ which provides a non-degenerate $R$-form on $B$. If $G$ has odd order, we show that the $G$-forms $(B, Tr'_B)$ and $(A, Tr'_A)$ are locally isomorphic and we study the question of when they are globally isomorphic. Suppose now that $K$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb Q_p$ with valuation ring $R$. In the course of our study we are led to consider the extension of scalars map $\varphi_K: G_0(A^D)\rightarrow G_0(A^D_K)=G_0(K[G])$. When $A^D$ is the group ring $R[G]$, Swan showed that $\varphi_K$ is an isomorphism. Jensen and Larson proved that $\varphi_K$ is also an isomorphism for any Hopf $R$-order $A^D$ of $K[G]$ when $G$ is abelian and $K$ is large enough. Here we prove that $\ker \varphi_K$ is at most a finite abelian $p$-group. However, numerous examples lead us to conjecture that Swan's result extends to all Hopf $R$-orders in $K[G]$, i.e. $\ker \varphi_K$ is always trivial.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a smooth $p$-adic formal scheme over the ring of integers of a perfectoid field of mixed characteristic $(0,p)$ containing all $p$-power roots of unity, we prove that the prismatic cohomology of a locally finite free prismatic crystal is isomorphic to the $A_{\inf}$-cohomology of the corresponding relative Breuil-Kisin-Fargues module, which is a certain type of locally finite free $\mathbb{A}_{\inf}$-module, on the pro\'etale site of the generic fiber. We use a global description of the former in terms of $q$-Higgs modules via cohomological descent. We also discuss its compatibility with inverse image functors, scalar extensions under Frobenius, and tensor products.</p></details>

> **Comment:** to appear in Algebra & Number Theory (2025), any comment is welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p\in\mathbb Z$ be a prime, $\overline{\mathbb Q_p}$ a fixed algebraic closure of the field of $p$-adic numbers and $\overline{\mathbb Z_p}$ the absolute integral closure of the ring of $p$-adic integers. Given a residually algebraic torsion extension $W$ of $\mathbb Z_{(p)}$ to $\mathbb Q(X)$, by Kaplansky's characterization of immediate extensions of valued fields, there exists a pseudo-convergent sequence of transcendental type $E=\{s_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}\subset\overline{\mathbb Q_p}$ such that $W=\mathbb Z_{(p),E}=\{\phi\in\mathbb Q(X)\mid\phi(s_n)\in\overline{\mathbb Z_p},\text{ for all sufficiently large }n\in\mathbb N\}$. We show here that we may assume that $E$ is stacked, in the sense that, for each $n\in\mathbb N$, the residue field (the value group, respectively) of $\overline{\mathbb Z_p}\cap\mathbb Q_p(s_n)$ is contained in the residue field (the value group, respectively) of $\overline{\mathbb Z_p}\cap\mathbb Q_p(s_{n+1})$; this property of $E$ allows us to describe the residue field and value group of $W$. In particular, if $W$ is a DVR, then there exists $\alpha$ in the completion $\mathbb C_p$ of $\overline{\mathbb Q_p}$, $\alpha$ transcendental over $\mathbb Q$, such that $W=\mathbb Z_{(p),\alpha}=\{\phi\in\mathbb Q(X)\mid\phi(\alpha)\in O_p\}$, where $O_p$ is the unique local ring of $\mathbb C_p$; $\alpha$ belongs to $\overline{\mathbb Q_p}$ if and only if the residue field extension $W/M\supseteq\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z$ is finite. As an application, we provide a full characterization of the Dedekind domains between $\mathbb Z[X]$ and $\mathbb Q[X]$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 78 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2207.11663

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(G,G_1)$ be a symmetric pair of holomorphic type, and we consider a pair of Hermitian symmetric spaces $D_1=G_1/K_1\subset D=G/K$, realized as bounded symmetric domains in complex vector spaces $\mathfrak{p}^+_1\subset\mathfrak{p}^+$ respectively. Then the universal covering group $\widetilde{G}$ of $G$ acts unitarily on the weighted Bergman space $\mathcal{H}_\lambda(D)\subset\mathcal{O}(D)$ on $D$. Its restriction to the subgroup $\widetilde{G}_1$ decomposes discretely and multiplicity-freely, and its branching law is given explicitly by Hua--Kostant--Schmid--Kobayashi's formula in terms of the $K_1$-decomposition of the space $\mathcal{P}(\mathfrak{p}^+_2)$ of polynomials on the orthogonal complement $\mathfrak{p}^+_2$ of $\mathfrak{p}^+_1$ in $\mathfrak{p}^+$. The object of this article is to construct explicitly $\widetilde{G}_1$-intertwining operators (symmetry breaking operators) $\mathcal{H}_\lambda(D)|_{\widetilde{G}_1}\to\mathcal{H}_{\varepsilon_1\lambda}(D_1,\mathcal{P}_{\mathbf{k}}(\mathfrak{p}^+_2))$ from holomorphic discrete series representations of $\widetilde{G}$ to those of $\widetilde{G}_1$, which are unique up to constant multiple for sufficiently large $\lambda$. These operators are given by differential operators whose symbols are computed as the inner products of polynomials on $\mathfrak{p}^+_2$. In this article, we treat the case $\mathfrak{p}^+,\mathfrak{p}^+_2$ are both simple of tube type and $\mathrm{rank}\mathfrak{p}^+=\mathrm{rank}\mathfrak{p}^+_2$. When $\mathrm{rank}\mathfrak{p}^+=3$, we treat all partitions $\mathbf{k}$, and when $\mathrm{rank}\mathfrak{p}^+$ is general, we treat partitions of the form $\mathbf{k}=(k,\ldots,k,k-l)$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Le Duc Hieu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** No figures. Includes a short appendix on a uniform short-interval BDH mean-square bound and a congruence-restricted dense-cluster lemma

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that once $\theta>17/30$, every sufficiently long interval $[x,x+x^\theta]$ contains many $k$-term arithmetic progressions of primes, uniformly in the starting point $x$. More precisely, for each fixed $k\ge3$ and $\theta>17/30$, for all sufficiently large $X$ and all $x\in[X,2X]$, $$ \#\{\text{$k$-APs of primes in }[x,x+x^\theta]\}\ \gg_{k,\theta}\ \frac{N^{2}}{\big((\varphi(W)/W)^{k}(\log R)^{k}\big)}\ \asymp\ \frac{X^{2\theta}}{(\log X)^{k+1+o(1)}}, $$ where $W:=\prod_{p\le \tfrac12\log\log X}p$, $N:=\lfloor x^\theta/W\rfloor$, and $R:=N^\eta$ for a small fixed $\eta=\eta(k,\theta)>0$. This is obtained by combining the uniform short-interval prime number theorem at exponents $\theta>17/30$ (a consequence of recent zero-density estimates of Guth and Maynard) with the Green-Tao transference principle (in the relative Szemer\'edi form) on a window-aligned $W$-tricked block. We also record a concise Maynard-type lemma on dense clusters \emph{restricted to a fixed congruence class} in tiny intervals $(\log x)^\varepsilon$, which we use as a warm-up and for context. An appendix contains a short-interval Barban-Davenport-Halberstam mean square bound (uniform in $x$) that we use as a black box for variance estimates.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 50 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The cluster variety of triples of flags (associated with a split simple Lie group of Dynkin type Delta) plays a key role in higher Teichmuller theory as developed by Fock-Goncharov, Jiarui Fei, Ian Le, ... and Goncharov-Shen. We refer to it as the basic triangle associated with Delta. In this paper, for simply laced Delta, we construct and study a Higgs category (in the sense of Yilin Wu) which we expect to categorify the basic triangle. This category is a certain exact dg category (in the sense of Xiaofa Chen) which is Frobenius and stably 2-Calabi-Yau. We show that it has indeed the expected cyclic group symmetry and that its derived category has the expected braid group symmetry. A key ingredient in our construction is a conjecture by Merlin Christ, whose proof occupies most of this paper. The proof is based on a new description of the Higgs category in terms of Gorenstein projective dg modules. Our techniques are in the spirit of Orlov in his work on triangulated categories of graded B-branes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the spirit of arXiv:2501.12985, we propose an abelian categorification of $\hat{Z}$-invariants for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds. It provides a blueprint for the expected dictionary between these $3$-manifolds and log VOAs; that is, the contribution from 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory via 3d-3d correspondence is encoded as recursive and binary deviations from semisimplicity in the abelian category of modules over the hypothetical log VOA, and is decoded by the recursive application of the theory of Feigin--Tipunin construction. In particular, the nested Weyl-type character formulas provide virtual generalized characters reconstructing the $\hat{Z}$-invariants.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The eigenvectors of the $(N+1)\times (N+1)$ symmetric Pascal matrix $T_N$ are analogs of prolate spheroidal wave functions in the discrete setting. The generating functions of the eigenvectors of $T_N$ are prolate spheroidal functions in the sense that they are simultaneously eigenfunctions of a third-order differential operator and an integral operator over the critical line $\{z\in\mathbb{C}: \text{Re}(z) = 1/2\}$. For even, positive integers $N$, we obtain an explicit formula for the generating function of an eigenvector of the symmetric pascal matrix with eigenvalue $1$. In the special case when $N=p-1$ for an odd prime $p$, we show that the generating function is equivalent modulo $p$ to $(\# E_z(\mathbb F_p)-1)^2$, where $\# E_z(\mathbb F_p)$ is the number of points on the Legendre elliptic curve $y^2 = x(x-1)(x-z)$ over the finite field $\mathbb F_p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the structure and representation theory of the principal W-algebra $\mathsf{W}^{\mathsf{k}}_{\mathrm{pr}}$ of $\mathsf{V}^{\mathsf{k}}(\mathfrak{psl}_{2|2})$. The defining operator product expansions are computed, as is the Zhu algebra, and these results are used to classify irreducible highest-weight modules. In particular, for $\mathsf{k} = \pm \frac{1}{2}$, $\mathsf{W}^{\mathsf{k}}_{\mathrm{pr}}$ is not simple and the corresponding simple quotient is the symplectic fermion vertex algebra. We use this fact, along with inverse hamiltonian reduction, to study relaxed highest-weight and logarithmic modules for the small $N=4$ superconformal algebra at central charges $-9$ and $-3$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We generalize Balmer and Gallauer's (permutation) twisted cohomology ring, working toward an alternative method of deducing the Balmer spectrum of the derived category of permutation modules for any finite $p$-group. The construction comes equipped with a canonical comparison map from the Balmer spectrum to the homogeneous spectrum of the twisted cohomology ring. We show the comparison map is injective for any finite $p$-group and furthermore, an open immersion when the twisted cohomology ring is noetherian. For elementary abelian $p$-groups, the twisted cohomology ring coincides with Balmer and Gallauer's original construction. To perform this construction, we utilize endotrivial complexes (i.e. the invertible objects of the derived category of permutation modules) arising up to a shift from Bredon homology of representation spheres. This topological structure allows us to construct certain $p$-local isomorphisms, from which we build a refined open cover of the Balmer spectrum indexed by conjugacy classes of subgroups of $G$. Under this open cover, every endotrivial is isomorphic to a shift of the tensor unit in each localization, thus verifying that all endotrivials are line bundles. When the twisted cohomology ring is noetherian, this open cover endows the Balmer spectrum with Dirac scheme structure.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Modular resolutions help us to understand the structure of modules over rings with positive characteristic. In this paper, we introduce a new technique based on Wildberger's polyseries expansions to construct and analyse such resolutions

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the modular resolution method using a new tool called a polyserie, introduced by Wildberger N.J. \& Rubine D. in their recent article \cite{wildberger2025hyper}. In the present article we try to prove an equivalence theorem of the existence and the uniqueness of the solution of the equation of the form:\\ $H_{t}^{2}\left(x\right) -H_{t}\left( x\right) +t\equiv 0\ \ \left( \mathrm{mod}\text{ }t^{n}\right) $, by using the same recurrence formula introduced in \cite{wildberger2025hyper} between the Catalan sequence terms: $C_{n+1}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}C_{k}C_{n-k}$. We introduce Wildberger's polynumber sequences, binomial Chu-Vandermonde identity, truncated polyseries and finally modular resolution as application.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a semisimple algebraic group over the complex numbers and $K$ be a connected reductive group mapping to $G$ so that the Lie algebra of $K$ gets identified with a symmetric subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$. So we can talk about Harish-Chandra $(\mathfrak{g},K)$-modules, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is the Lie algebra of $G$. The goal of this paper is to give a geometric classification of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules with full support over the filtered quantizations of the algebras of the form $\mathbb{C}[\mathbb{O}]$, where $\mathbb{O}$ is a nilpotent orbit in $\mathfrak{g}$ with codimension of the boundary at least $4$. Namely, we embed the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules into the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible $K$-equivariant suitably twisted local systems on $\mathbb{O}\cap \mathfrak{k}^\perp$. We show that under certain conditions, for example when $K\subset G$ or when $\mathfrak{g}\cong \mathfrak{so}_n,\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$, this embedding is in fact a bijection. On the other hand, for $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_n$ and $K=\mathrm{Spin}_n$, the embedding is not bijective and we give a description of the image. Finally, we perform a partial classification for exceptional Lie algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the triple convolution sum of the generalised divisor functions given by $$\sum_{n\leq x} d_k(n+h)d_l(n)d_m(n-h),$$ where $h \le x^{1-\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon>0$ and $d_k(n)$ denotes the generalised divisor function which counts the number of ways $n$ can be written as product of $k$ many positive integers. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, we note a predicted asymptotic estimate for the above sum, where the constant appearing in the estimate can be obtained from the theory of Dirichlet series of several complex variables and also using some probabilistic arguments. Then we show that a lower bound of the correct order can be derived using the several variable Tauberian theorems, where, more importantly, the constant in the predicted asymptotic can be recovered.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate a notion of "higher modularity" for elliptic curves over function fields. Given such an elliptic curve $E$ and an integer $r\geq 1$, we say that $E$ is $r$-modular when there is an algebraic correspondence between a stack of $r$-legged shtukas, and the $r$-fold product of $E$ considered as an elliptic surface. The (known) case $r=1$ is analogous to the notion of modularity for elliptic curves over $\mathbf{Q}$. Our main theorem is that if $E/\mathbf{F}_q(t)$ is a nonisotrivial elliptic curve whose conductor has degree 4, then $E$ is 2-modular. Ultimately, the proof uses properties of K3 surfaces. Along the way we prove a result of independent interest: A K3 surface admits a finite morphism to a Kummer surface attached to a product of elliptic curves if and only if its Picard lattice is rationally isometric to the Picard lattice of such a Kummer surface.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a recently discovered carrollian bosonic string, described classically by a sigma model where both the worldsheet and the target spacetime are carrollian. After fixing the carrollian analogue of the conformal gauge, we determine the Lie algebra of residual gauge symmetries and show it is isomorphic to the three-dimensional extended BMS algebra. We quantise the sigma model \`a la BRST and determine the spectrum of the corresponding string theory by computing the BRST cohomology. In contrast with the usual bosonic string, the spectrum of the carrollian string is finite-dimensional. The cohomology displays Poincar\'e duality and can be interpreted, for a given momentum, as inducing representations for unitary irreducible representations of the 26-dimensional Carroll group. Furthermore we interpret (most of) the cohomology as deformations of the spacetime carrollian structure augmented by the Kalb--Ramond field to which the carrollian string couples.</p></details>

There is no known general closed form for $g(k)$, though for $g(k)$ has been evaluated for small $k$.

We also exhibit Gauss-invariant, ergodic measures with arbitrary irrationality exponent. The proofs are applications of our study of the ``extravagance'' of positive, stationary, stochastic processes.

> **Comment:** 23 pages. The previous version of this arXiv submission has now been split into two articles (the present one dealing with finite fields and another dealing with more general rings, to appear soon)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove new combinatorial results about polynomial configurations in large subsets of finite fields. Bergelson--Leibman--McCutcheon (2005) showed that for any polynomial $P(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ with $P(0) = 0$, if $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q$ is a subset of a $q$-element finite field and $A$ does not contains distinct $a, b$ such that $b - a = P(x)$ for some $x$, then $|A| = o(q)$. In fields of sufficiently large characterstic, the bound $o(q)$ can be improved to $O(q^{1/2})$ by the Weil bound. We match this bound in the low characteristic setting and give a complete algebraic characterization of the class of polynomials for which the Furstenberg--S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy theorem holds over finite fields of fixed characteristic. Our next main result deals with an enhancement of the Furstenberg--S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy theorem over finite fields. Another consequence of the Weil bound is that if $P(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q$, and there do not exist elements $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ with $b - a = P(x)$ for some $x$, then $|A| |B| = O(q)$, provided that the characteristic of $\mathbb{F}_q$ is sufficiently large depending on $P$. We provide a complete description of the family of polynomials for which this asymmetric enhancement holds over fields of fixed characteristic, achieving the same quantitative bounds that are available in the high characteristic setting. The exponential sum estimates that we produce in dealing with the above problems also allow us to establish partition regularity of families of polynomial equations over finite fields. As an example, we prove: if $P(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ with $P(0) = 0$, then for any $r \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists $N = N(P,r)$ and $c = c(P,r) > 0$ such that if $q > N$ and $\mathbb{F}_q = \bigcup_{i=1}^r{C_i}$, then there are at least $cq^2$ monochromatic solutions to the equation $P(x) + P(y) = P(z)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve and $p \geq 3$ a prime. The modular curve $X_E^-(p)$ parametrizes elliptic curves with $p$-torsion modules anti-symplectically isomorphic to $E[p]$. For each $\ell \neq p$, we give conditions, in terms of the type of reduction of $E$ at $\ell$ and standard invariants associated to $E/\mathbb{Q}_\ell$, for $X_E^-(p)(\mathbb{Q}_\ell)$ to be non-empty. Moreover, our conditions completely classify when $X_E^-(p)(\mathbb{Q}_\ell) \neq \emptyset$ except in a special case of good reduction; our main result includes $\ell = p$ when $E$ is semistable at $p$. As an application, we classify CM curves $E/\mathbb{Q}$ where the modular curve $X_E^-(p)$ is a counterexample to the Hasse principle for infinitely many $p$. Assuming the Frey--Mazur conjecture, we prove that for at least $60\%$ of rational elliptic curves $E$, the modular curve $X_E^-(p)$ is a counterexample to the Hasse principle for $50\%$ of primes $p$. Additionally, we simplify several local symplectic criteria in the work of the first author and Alain Kraus.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 14 pages; revised according to referee comments

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given two subsets $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p$ and a binary relation $\mathcal{R} \subseteq A \times B$, the restricted sumset of $A, B$ with respect to $\mathcal{R}$ is defined as $A +_{\mathcal{R}} B = \{ a+b \colon (a,b) \notin \mathcal{R} \}$. When $\mathcal{R}$ is taken as the equality relation, determining the minimum value of $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} B|$ is the famous Erd\H{o}s--Heilbronn problem, which was solved separately by Dias da Silva, Hamidoune and Alon, Nathanson and Ruzsa. Lev later conjectured that if $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p$ with $|A| + |B| \le p$ and $\mathcal{R}$ is a matching between subsets of $A$ and $B$, then $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} B| \ge |A| + |B| - 3$. We confirm this conjecture in the case where $|A| + |B| \le (1-\varepsilon)p$ for any $\varepsilon > 0$, provided that $p > p_0$ for some sufficiently large $p_0$ depending only on $\varepsilon$. Our proof builds on a recent work by Bollob\'as, Leader, and Tiba, and a rectifiability argument developed by Green and Ruzsa. Furthermore, our method extends to cases when $\mathcal{R}$ is a degree-bounded relation, either on both sides $A$ and $B$ or solely on the smaller set. In addition, we construct subsets $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p$ with $|A| = \frac{6p}{11} - O(1)$ such that $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} A| = p-3$ for any prime number $p$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is a matching on $A$. This extends an earlier construction by Lev and highlights a distinction between the combinatorial notion of the restricted sumset and the classcial Erd\H{o}s--Heilbronn problem, where $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} A| \ge p$ holds given $\mathcal{R} = \{(a,a) \colon a \in A\}$ is the equality relation on $A$ and $|A| \ge \frac{p+3}{2}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Walled Brauer algebras $B_N ( m , n ) $ illuminate the combinatorics of mixed tensor representations of $U(N)$, with $m$ copies of the fundamental and $n$ copies of the anti-fundamental representation. They lie at the intersection of research in representation theory, AdS/CFT and quantum information theory. They have been used to study of correlators in multi-matrix models motivated by brane-anti-brane physics in AdS/CFT. They have been applied in computing and optimising fidelities of port-based quantum teleportation. There is a large $N$ regime, specifically $ N \ge (m+n)$ where the algebras are semi-simple and their representation theory more tractable. There are known combinatorial formulae for dimensions of irreducible representations and associated reduction multiplicities. The large $N$ regime has a stability property whereby these formulae are independent of $N$. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the combinatorics in the non-semisimple regime of $ N = m +n - l $, with positive $l$. We introduce restricted Bratteli diagrams (RBD) which are useful as an instrument to process known data from the large $N$ regime to calculate representation theory data in the non-semisimple regime. We identify within the non-semisimple regime, a region of $(m,n)$-stability, where $ \min ( m, n ) \ge ( 2l -3) $ and the RBD take a stable form depending on $l$ only and not the choice of $ m,n$ within the region. In this regime, several aspects of the combinatorics of the RBD are controlled by a universal partition function for an infinite tower of simple harmonic oscillators closely related, but not identical, to the partition function of 2D non-chiral free scalar field theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For two real bases $q_0, q_1 > 1$, a binary sequence $i_1 i_2 \cdots \in \{0,1\}^\infty$ is the $(q_0,q_1)$-expansion of the number $$ \pi_{q_0,q_1}(i_1 i_2 \cdots) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{i_k}{q_{i_1} \cdots q_{i_k}}. $$ Let $U_{q_0,q_1}$ be the set of all real numbers having a unique $(q_0,q_1)$-expansion. When the bases are equal, i.e., $q_0 = q_1 = q$, Allaart and Kong (2019) established the continuity in $q$ of the Hausdorff dimension of the univoque set $U_{q,q}$, building on the work of Komornik, Kong, and Li (2017). We derive explicit formulas for the Hausdorff dimension of $U_{q_0,q_1}$ and the entropy of the underlying subshift for arbitrary $q_0, q_1 > 1$, and prove the continuity of these quantities as functions of $(q_0, q_1)$. Our results also concern general dynamical systems described by binary shifts with a hole, including, in particular, the doubling map with a hole and (linear) Lorenz maps.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a generalization of Littlewood's criterion on $L^\alpha$-flatness by proving that there is no $L^\alpha$-flat polynomials, $\alpha>0$, within the class of analytic polynomials on the unit circle of the form $ P_n(z)=\sum_{m=1}^{n}c_m z^m, n \in {\mathbb{N}}^*,$ satisfying $$ \sum_{m=1}^{n}|c_m|^2 \leq \frac{K}{n^2} \sum_{m=1}^{n}m^2 |c_m|^2, $$ where $K$ is an absolutely constant. As a consequence, we confirm the $L^\alpha$-Littlewood conjecture, and thereby the $L^1$-Newman and $L^\infty$-Erd\"os conjectures. Our approach combines the $L^\alpha$ Littlewood theorem with the generalized Clarkson's second inequality for $L^\alpha(X,\mathcal{A},m;B)$, with $B$ a Banach spaces and $1 < \alpha \leq 2.$ It follows that there are only finitely many Barker sequences, and we further present several applications in number theory and the spectral theory of dynamical systems. Finally, we construct Gauss-Fresnel polynomials that are Mahler-flat, providing a new proof of the Beller-Newman theorem.</p></details>

Our main result shows that the bias towards either sign is completely determined by the order of vanishing of the $L$-function $L(s, f)$ at the central point of the critical strip. We then give several examples of modular forms where we explicitly compute the order of vanishing of $L(s, f)$ at the central point and as a by-product, verify the super-positivity property, in the sense of Yun--Zhang (2017), for these examples.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper aims to employ a cluster-theoretic approach to provide a class of Diophantine equations whose solutions can be obtained by starting from initial solutions through mutations. We establish a novel framework bridging cluster theory and Diophantine equations through the lens of cluster symmetry. On the one hand, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for Laurent polynomials to remain invariant under a given cluster symmetric map. On the other hand, we construct a discriminant algorithm to determine whether a given Laurent polynomial has cluster symmetry and whether it can be realized in a generalized cluster algebra. As applications of this framework, we solve Markov-cluster equations, describe three classes of invariant Laurent polynomial rings, resolve two questions posed by Gyoda and Matsushita, and lastly give two MATLAB programs about our main theorems.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fock and Goncharov introduced a quantization of higher Teichm\"uller theory using cluster Poisson varieties and their noncommutative deformations, associating to a complex semisimple Lie group $G$ and a marked surface $S$ a quantum algebra $\mathbb{L}_{G,S}$ equipped with an action of the surface mapping class group. They conjectured that these quantizations form an algebraic analog of a modular functor: cutting a surface along a simple closed curve should correspond to a canonical gluing isomorphism for the associated algebras. In this paper we prove this conjecture for $G = \mathrm{PGL}_{n+1}$. Our approach requires two extensions of the Fock-Goncharov framework: (1) enhanced moduli spaces incorporating additional boundary data, providing algebro-geometric analogs of Fenchel-Nielsen twist coordinates; and (2) the residue universal Laurent ring, a refinement of the quantum universal Laurent ring obtained by localizing and imposing residue conditions. Using these tools, we construct canonical cutting isomorphisms that are equivariant under mapping class group actions and suffice to reconstruct the entire algebra $\mathbb{L}_{G,S}$ from data associated to the cut surface.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This version corrects minor errors in valuation bookkeeping

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For each $n\geq 1$, we express the partition function $p(n)$ as a CM trace on $X_0(6)$ of the discriminant $\Delta_n:=1-24n$ invariants of a weight 0 weak Maass function $P$ that records where CM elliptic curves sit on $X(1)$, together with their canonical first-order "CM tangent'', the diagonal local slope of the CM isogeny relation on $X(1)\times X(1)$. In this viewpoint, we obtain a formula for $p(n)\!\!\pmod{\ell},$ when $\ell$ is inert in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta_n}),$ as a Brandt-module pairing $\langle u_{\Delta_n},v_P\rangle$ that is assembled from oriented optimal embeddings of Eichler orders. For $\ell \in \{5, 7, 11\}$ and $j\geq 1$, we obtain a new proof of the Ramanujan congruences $$ p(5^j n +\beta_5(j))\equiv 0\pmod{5^j}, $$ $$ p(7^j n +\beta_7(j))\equiv 0\pmod{7^{ [ j/2]+1}}, $$ $$ p(11^jn+\beta_{11}(j))\equiv 0\pmod{11^j}, $$ where $\beta_m(j)$ is the unique residue $0\le \beta<m^j$ with $24\,\beta_m(j)\equiv 1\pmod{m^j}$. The key point is a "bonus valuation" that stems from the fact that the supersingular locus of $X_0(6)_{\mathbb{F}_{\ell}}$ lies over $\{0, 1728\}$ for $\ell \in \{5, 7, 11\}.$ This special property, combined with the uniform growth of the $\lambda$-adic valuations of the number of oriented optimal embeddings, explains these congruences. More generally, we give a portable genus 0 template showing that the Watson--Atkin $U_\ell$-contraction works uniformly for suitable traces of singular moduli for genus 0 modular curves with $\ell\nmid N.$</p></details>

> **Comment:** 26 pages, comments are highly welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we first introduce associative-Yamaguti algebras as the associative analogue of Lie-Yamaguti algebras. Associative algebras, reductive associative algebras and associative triple systems of the first kind form subclasses of associative-Yamaguti algebras. Any diassociative algebra canonically provides an associative-Yamaguti algebra structure. We confirm that any associative-Yamaguti algebra admits an enveloping associative algebra (i.e., it can be obtained from a reductive associative algebra). We show that a suitable skew-symmetrization of an associative-Yamaguti algebra gives rise to a Lie-Yamaguti algebra structure. Next, we define the $(2,3)$-cohomology group of an associative-Yamaguti algebra to study formal one-parameter deformations and abelian extensions. Later, we consider Yamaguti multiplications on a nonsymmetric operad as a generalization of associative-Yamaguti algebras. This notion further leads us to introduce dendriform-Yamaguti algebras, which are splitting objects for associative-Yamaguti algebras. Finally, we consider relative Rota-Baxter operators on associative-Yamaguti algebras to establish close relationships with dendriform-Yamaguti algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The U-dualities of maximally supersymmetric non-chiral supergravity (SUGRA) theories lead to strong constraints on the non-perturbative structure of quantum gravity. In this paper we determine Spin- and Pin-lifts of these dualities, which extend this action to fermionic degrees of freedom. Among other things, this allows us to access non-supersymmetric sectors of these low energy effective field theories in which bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom are treated differently. We use this refinement of the duality groups, in tandem with the Swampland Cobordism Conjecture, to predict new codimension-two branes. These are a natural generalization of the recently discovered R7-branes of type II string theories. The first bordism groups for Spin-twisted duality bundles follow directly from the Abelianization of the duality groups. Viewing the SUGRA theory as the low energy limit of a toroidal compactification of M-theory, winding around these codimension-two defects enacts a reflection around one of the torus directions, which in the effective field theory appears as a charge conjugation symmetry. We establish some basic properties of such branes, including determining BPS objects which can end on it, as well as braiding rules and bound states realized by multiple reflection branes.</p></details>

To show this, we prove structural statements about graphs whose smallest eigenvalue is small in absolute value. As another application, we show that any graph $G$ with $m$ edges and no clique of size $m^{1/2-\delta}$ has a cut of size least $m/2+m^{1/2+\varepsilon}$ for some $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(\delta)>0$. This proves a weak version of a celebrated conjecture of Alon, Bollob\'as, Krivelevich, and Sudakov.

This correction affects the combined exponent alpha_K and the final expression for the region of absolute convergence, R_abs (Theorem 4.3). The abstract and introduction have been revised accordingly

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper constructs a weight-shifting integral operator, U_{k,t}, that maps the space of weight-k Maass forms to the space of weight-t functions for the full modular group SL(2, Z). The operator is defined as an integral transform whose kernel, K_{k,t,q}, is the product of a specially designed covariant factor P and a modular invariant function F. The central hypothesis of our method is that the kernel itself must be an eigenfunction of the weight-t hyperbolic Laplacian Delta_t with respect to its first variable. We show that this spectral condition reduces the problem of determining the invariant function F to a second-order ordinary differential equation. The principal result of this work is the identification of this ODE as a Papperitz-Riemann equation, which is then transformed into the standard Gauss Hypergeometric Differential Equation. We provide an explicit determination of the hypergeometric parameters (a,b,c) in terms of the initial automorphic data. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of the operator's convergence, rigorously establishing the region of absolute convergence in the parameter space by examining the asymptotic behavior of the kernel. The emergence of the hypergeometric structure suggests a deep connection between these weight-shifting operators and the theory of hypergeometric motives in arithmetic geometry, a principle supported by the recovery of the periods of the Legendre family of elliptic curves in a specific case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>To apply the Euler system method to a $p$-adic Galois representation $T$, one needs the existence of a $\sigma \in G_{\mathbb{Q}(\mu_{p^{\infty}})}$ such that $V/(\sigma-1)V$ is free of rank one over the coefficient ring: we say that such a $\sigma$ is an Euler-suitable element for $V$. Given a non-CM classical newform $f$ of weight $k \geq 2$ and character $\chi$, a classical newform $g$ of weight $1$ and character $\psi$, and a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of residue characteristic $p$ of a sufficiently large number field, we consider the situation where $V=V_{f,g,\mathfrak{p}}$ is the tensor product of the $\mathfrak{p}$-adic representations attached to $f$ and $g$. D. Loeffler asked the following question: is is true that if $\chi\psi \neq 1$, then there is an Euler-suitable element for $V_{f,g,\mathfrak{p}}$ for all but finitely many $\mathfrak{p}$? He gave a positive answer when $f,g$ had coprime conductors. We give several weaker sufficient conditions to answer this question in the affirmative. As an application, we remove some of the technical assumptions in the version of the Bloch-Kato Conjecture proved in arXiv:1503.02888. We also show that the general answer to the question is negative, by constructing a family of counter-examples, and giving additional counter-examples that do not fit in this family.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let F be a non-trivial finite extension of the p-adic numbers, and G be a compact p-adic Lie group whose Lie algebra is isomorphic to a split semisimple F-Lie algebra. We prove that the mod p Iwasawa algebra of G has no modules of canonical dimension one. One consequence is a new upper bound on the Krull dimension of the Iwasawa algebra. We also prove a canonical dimension-theoretic criterion for a mod p smooth admissible representation to be of finite length. Combining our results shows that any smooth admissible representation of $GL_n(F)$, with central character, has finite length if its dual has canonical dimension two.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We classify the elementary classical and quantum Lifshitz systems. Lifshitz systems are systems where space and time scale anisotropically. That is, there is a constant $z$ such that under scaling by a factor of $\lambda$, \begin{equation*} \boldsymbol{x}\rightarrow \lambda \boldsymbol{x} \text{ and } t\rightarrow \lambda^{z}t \end{equation*} There are seven Lie groups, called the Lifshitz groups, which characterise all Lifshitz symmetries. Elementary classical Lifshitz systems are the symplectic manifolds with a transitive Lifshitz action, which turn out to be coadjoint orbits of the Lifshitz groups and their one-dimensional central extensions up to covering. Elementary quantum Lifshitz systems are the projective unitary irreducible representations of the Lifshitz groups.</p></details>

The aim of this note is to initiate its combinatorial study in the cases when $G$ is the complex orthogonal or symplectic group. The coordinate ring of the cone of $G$ is a finitely generated commutative graded algebra. First the $G\times G$-module structure of its homogeneous components is determined. This is used to compute the Hilbert series of this coordinate ring in the cases when $G$ is the orthogonal group $\mathrm{O}(3)$, $\mathrm{O}(4)$, the special orthogonal group $\mathrm{SO}(4)$, and when $G$ is the symplectic group $\mathrm{Sp}(4)$. It is concluded that the coordinate ring of the cone of $\mathrm{O}(3)$ is not Koszul, hence the vanishing ideal of this cone has no quadratic Gr\"obner basis (although it is minimally generated by quadratic elements).</p></details>

In this paper, we study the second partial Euler-Poincare characteristic $\chi_{2}(G_{K,S},M)$ for a finite $G_{K,S}$-module $M$, without imposing the condition that the order of $M$ is an $S$-unit. By adjoining a further finite set of primes of $K$, which can be chosen to be disjoint from any prescribed set of primes of density zero, we obtain an explicit formula for $\chi_{2}(G_{K,S},M)$. As an application, we investigate the presentation of the Galois group $G_{K,S}$. Furthermore, we construct counterexamples to the dimension conjecture for Galois deformation rings over all number fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article presents a comprehensive data-scientific investigation into the arithmetic statistics of congruent number elliptic curves, leveraging a dataset of square-free integers up to $3$ million. We analyze the Mordell-Weil ranks, 2-Selmer ranks, and 3-Selmer ranks of the corresponding elliptic curves $E_D: y^2 = x^3 - D^2x$, where $D$ is a square-free number. Our study empirically examines the Heath-Brown heuristics, which predict the distribution of $2$-Selmer ranks as well as congruent numbers based on their residue modulo $8$. In particular, offering statistical insights into the proportion of numbers whose associated elliptic curves have positive rank. We provide a rigorous verification of Goldfeld's Conjecture in this context, analyzing the distribution of analytic ranks and demonstrating their alignment with the conjectured $50/50$ split for ranks $0$ and $1$. Furthermore, we explore the conjectural asymptotic distribution of $2-$ and $3$-torsion part of the Tate-Shafarevich group of these curves. Based on empirical evidence, we also suggest potential statistical distribution of $3$-Selmer and Mordell-Weil ranks. We also examine the averages of Frobenius traces and observe that they tend to zero without exhibiting any murmuration-like patterns. In addition to these number-theoretic analyses, we apply machine learning techniques to classify and predict congruent numbers, exploring the efficacy of computational methods in distinguishing congruent from non-congruent numbers based on the arithmetic properties of elliptic curves. This interdisciplinary approach blends advanced number theory with modern data science, providing empirical support for conjectures as well as discovery of new patterns.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is known that a large class of characters of 2d conformal field theories (CFTs) can be written in the form of a Nahm sum. In \cite{Zagier:2007knq}, D. Zagier identified a list of Nahm sum expressions that are modular functions under a congruence subgroup of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and can be thought of as candidates for characters of rational CFTs. Motivated by the observation that the same formulas appear as the half-indices of certain 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories, we perform a general search over low-rank 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ abelian Chern-Simons matter theories which either flow to unitary TFTs or $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-zero SCFTs in the infrared. These are exceptional classes of 3d theories, which are expected to support rational and $C_2$-cofinite chiral algebras on their boundary. We compare and contrast our results with Zagier's and comment on a possible generalization of Nahm's conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The existence of a tilting or silting object is an important feature for an algebraic triangulated category since it gives an equivalence with the derived category of a ring. By applying tilting theory, we study Cohen-Macaulay representations of Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras $A$, where do not assume that $A_0$ is a field. This is a large class of noncommutative Gorenstein rings containing Gorenstein orders. In this paper, we concentrate on the case where $A$ has dimension one. We prove that the stable category $\mathrm{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}_0^{\mathbb Z}A$ admits a silting object if and only if $A_0$ has finite global dimension. In this case, we give a silting object explicitly. Moreover, under the additional assumption that $A$ is ring-indecomposable, we prove that it admits a tilting object if and only if either $A$ is Artin-Schelter regular or the average Gorenstein parameter of $A$ is non-positive. These results are far-reaching generalizations of the results of Buchweitz, Iyama, and Yamaura. We give two different proofs of the second result; one is based on Orlov-type semiorthogonal decompositions, and the other is based on a more direct calculation. We apply our results to a Gorenstein tiled order $A$ to prove that $\mathrm{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}^{\mathbb Z}A$ is equivalent to the derived category of the incidence algebra of an (explicitly constructed) poset. We also apply our results and Koszul duality to study smooth noncommutative quadric hypersurfaces $\mathrm{\mathsf{qgr}} B$ of arbitrary dimension. We prove that the derived category $\mathsf{D}^b(\mathrm{\mathsf{qgr}} B)$ admits an (explicitly constructed) tilting object. Through Orlov's semiorthogonal decomposition, our tilting object has the tilting object of $\mathrm{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}^{\mathbb Z}B$ due to Smith and Van den Bergh as a direct summand.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra. We prove the convergence of Segal's sewing of conformal blocks associated to analytic families of pointed compact Riemann surfaces and grading-restricted generalized $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$-modules (where $N=1,2,\dots$) that are not necessarily tensor products of $\mathbb V$-modules, generalizing significantly the results on convergence in [Gui24]. We show that ``higher genus pseudo-$q$-traces" (called pseudo-sewing in this article) can be recovered from the above generalization of Segal's sewing to $\mathbb{V}^{\otimes N}$-modules. Therefore, our result on the convergence of the generalized Segal's sewing implies the convergence of pseudo-sewing, and hence covers both the convergence of genus-$0$ sewing in [Hua05a,HLZ12] and the convergence of pseudo-$q$-traces in [Miy04] and [Fio16]. Using a similar method, we also prove the convergence of Virasoro uniformization, i.e., the convergence of conformal blocks deformed by non-automomous meromorphic vector fields near the marked points. The local freeness of the analytic sheaves of conformal blocks is a consequence of this convergence. It will be used in the third paper of this series to prove the sewing-factorization theorem.</p></details>

For even-order abelian groups, a standard $|G|/2$ lower bound applies. We prove this is optimal for $G = (\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z})^n$ using a pair-counting argument, with an explicit construction of vectors with first coordinate odd (1 or 3 mod 4), yielding size $2 \times 4^{n-1} = 4^n / 2$ and density 0.5, verified for $n \leq 10$. An AI-assisted hybrid greedy-genetic algorithm rediscovers this optimal size, highlighting its potential in combinatorial search.</p></details>

> **Comment:** In v1, Proposition 6.8 is false. There is a counterexample: $\mathfrak{g}=A_3$, $i=2$, $w=s_1s_3s_2s_1s_3$. Since the paper heavily depends on this proposition, we withdraw v1. We do not know if Theorem 6.12 is true or not. In v3 with 62 pages, the error is corrected

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A localized quantum unipotent coordinate category $\widetilde{\mathscr{C}_w}$ associated with a Weyl group element $w$ is a rigid monoidal category which is obtained by applying the localization process to a subcategory of the category of finite-dimensional graded modules of a quiver Hecke algebra. We shall show that the family of the isomorphism classes (up to grading shifts) of simple objects in $\widetilde{\mathscr{C}_w}$ possesses a crystal structure and it is isomorphic to the cellular crystal associated with $w$. As an application of this result, we shall show the connectedness of the crystal graph of an arbitrary cellular crystal.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 26 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we define extended trigonometric functions via series and employ the method of contour integration to investigate the parity of certain cyclotomic Euler sums and multiple polylogarithm function. We can provide the statement of parity results for cyclotomic Euler sums of arbitrary order, explicit formulas for the parity of cyclotomic linear and quadratic Euler sums, as well as some formulas for the parity of cyclotomic cubic Euler sums and multiple polylogarithms. As a direct corollary, we derive known formulas concerning the parity of classical Euler sums and alternating Euler sums.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 51 pages. Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a power law for the asymptotic decay of the Favard length of neighbourhoods of certain self-similar sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \geq 2$. These self-similar sets are generalizations of the so-called four-corner Cantor set to higher dimensions, as well as to a more general class of rational digit sets. When $d \geq 3$, our estimates are the first such non-trivial asymptotic upper bounds for the Favard length problem. The extension to a new class of digit sets (which is new even when $d = 2$, but holds for $d \geq 2$ generally) uses the work of G. Kiss, I. Laba, G. Somlai and the author on vanishing sums of roots of unity and divisibility by many cyclotomic polynomials.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that, for any $r\geq 1$, if $g_1,\ldots,g_r$ are distinct coprime integers, sufficiently large depending only on $r$, then for any $\epsilon>0$ there are infinitely many integers $n$ such that all but $\epsilon \log n$ of the digits of $n$ are $\leq g_i/2$ in base $g_i$ for all $1\leq i\leq r$. In other words, for any fixed large bases, there are infinitely many $n$ such that almost all of the digits of $n$ are small in all bases simultaneously. This is both a quantitative and qualitative improvement over previous work of Croot, Mousavi, and Schmidt. As a consequence, we obtain a weak answer to a conjecture of Graham concerning divisibility of $\binom{2n}{n}$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** David Hemmer, Armin Straub, Karlee Westrem &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Amdeberhan recently proposed certain equalities between sums in the character table of symmetric groups. These equalities are between signed column sums in the character table, summing over the rows labeled by partitions in $\Ev$, where $\lambda$ is a partition of $n$ with $r$ nonzero parts and $\Ev$ is a multiset containing $2^r$ partitions of $2n$. While we observe that these equalities are not true in general, we prove that they do hold in interesting special cases. These lead to new equalities between sums of degrees of irreducible characters for the symmetric group and a new combinatorial interpretation for the Riordan numbers in terms of degrees of irreducible characters labeled by partitions with three parts of the same parity. This is the first, to our knowledge, theorem about degrees of symmetric group characters with parity conditions imposed on the partitions indexing the characters.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nickolas Andersen, Gradin Anderson &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Ramanujan's 1920 last letter to Hardy contains seventeen examples of mock theta functions which he organized into three "orders." The most famous of these is the third-order function $f(q)$ which has received the most attention of any individual mock theta function in the intervening century. In 1964, Andrews--improving on a result of Dragonette--gave an asymptotic formula for the coefficients of $f(q)$ and conjectured an exact formula for the coefficients: a conditionally convergent series that closely resembles the Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher formula for the partition function. To prove that the conjectured series converges, it is necessary to carefully measure the cancellation among the Kloosterman sums appearing in the formula. Andrews' conjecture was proved four decades later by Bringmann and Ono. Here we prove exact formulas for all seventeen of the mock theta functions appearing in Ramanujan's last letter. Along the way, we prove a general theorem bounding sums of Kloosterman sums for the Weil representation attached to a lattice of odd rank.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02725v1'>2509.02725</a>\]&nbsp; **Counting factorizations of Singer cycles in linear and unitary groups**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Joel Brewster Lewis, C. Ryan Vinroot &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 36 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We count factorizations of Singer cycles as products of reflections in the families of special and general unitary and linear groups over a finite field. In the case of minimum-length factorizations, the resulting answer is a striking product formula resembling the count for minimum-length factorizations of Coxeter elements into reflections in complex reflections groups. Moreover, for minimum length, the answers for the unitary and linear groups exhibit the phenomenon of Ennola duality, where the number of factorizations in a unitary group over the field $\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by replacing `$q$' with `$-q$' in the corresponding answer for a linear group. We use the character theory of these groups to make this count, and in particular we employ the Deligne--Lusztig theory of characters for finite reductive groups.</p></details>
