### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01689v2'>1912.01689</a>\]&nbsp; **Comparing the Kirwan and noncommutative resolutions of quotient varieties**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Špela Špenko, Michel Van den Bergh &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let a reductive group $G$ act on a smooth variety $X$ such that a good quotient $X{/\!\!/}G$ exists. We show that the derived category of a noncommutative crepant resolution (NCCR) of $X{/\!\!/} G$, obtained from a $G$-equivariant vector bundle on $X$, can be embedded in the derived category of the (canonical, stacky) Kirwan resolution of $X{/\!\!/} G$. In fact the embedding can be completed to a semi-orthogonal decomposition in which the other parts are all derived categories of Azumaya algebras over smooth Deligne-Mumford stacks.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Lidia Angeleri Hügel, Rosanna Laking, Francesco Sentieri &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the lattice $\mathbf{tors}(A)$ of torsion pairs in the category $\mathrm{mod}(A)$ of finitely generated modules over an artinian ring $A$. It was shown by the authors in previous work that $\mathbf{tors}(A)$ is isomorphic to a lattice formed by certain closed sets, called maximal rigid, in the Ziegler spectrum of the unbounded derived category $\mathrm{D}(A)$ of $A$. Moreover, the structure of this lattice is described by an operation on maximal rigid sets which encompasses (the dual of) silting mutation. In this paper we provide an explicit description of this operation and we discuss how it is reflected in the lattice $\mathbf{tors}(A)$. We establish a bijection between the wide intervals in $\mathbf{tors}(A)$ and the closed rigid sets in the Ziegler spectrum of $\mathrm{D}(A)$. Moreover, we show that the arrows in the Hasse quiver of $\mathbf{tors}(A)$ correspond to the closed rigid sets that are almost complete, or equivalently, that can be completed to a maximal rigid set in exactly two ways. Our results are most interesting in the case when $A$ is a finite dimensional algebra. In fact, we generalise results by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten, with an important difference: not every point in a maximal rigid set is mutable. We use the topology on the Ziegler spectrum to determine the mutable points. In the last section of the paper we illustrate our results by the example of a finite dimensional algebra arising from a triangulation of an annulus.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Huy Tuan Pham, Lisa Sauermann &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Graham conjectured in 1971 that for any prime $p$, any subset $S\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_p\setminus \{0\}$ admits an ordering $s_1,s_2,\dots,s_{|S|}$ where all partial sums $s_1, s_1+s_2,\dots,s_1+s_2+\dots+s_{|S|}$ are distinct. We prove this conjecture for all subsets $S\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_p\setminus \{0\}$ with $|S|\le p^{1-α}$ and $|S|$ sufficiently large with respect to $α$, for any $α\in (0,1)$. Combined with earlier results, this gives a complete resolution of Graham's rearrangement conjecture for all sufficiently large primes $p$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Mihalis Maliakas, Dimitra-Dionysia Stergiopoulou &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Title changed. Referee comments incorporated

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A LAnKe (also known as a Filippov algebra or a Lie algebra of the $n$-th kind) is a vector space equipped with a skew-symmetric $n$-linear form that satisfies the generalized Jacobi identity. Friedmann, Hanlon, Stanley and Wachs have shown that the symmetric group acts on the multilinear part of the free LAnKe on $2n-1$ generators as an irreducible representation. They announced that the multilinear component on $3n-2$ generators decomposes as a direct sum of two irreducible symmetric group representations and a proof was given recently in a subsequent paper by Friedmann, Hanlon and Wachs. In the present paper we provide a proof of the later statement. The two proofs are substantially different.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages, no figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The non-empty finite subsets of a multiplicatively written monoid form a monoid in their own right, and so do the finite subsets that contain the identity element. Partly due to their unusual arithmetic properties, these structures, known as power monoids, have attracted increasing attention in recent years and have in turn stimulated growing interest in new perspectives in factorization theory, better suited to non-cancellative settings. We survey these developments and briefly review some related aspects.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Claus Hertling, Khadija Larabi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 96 pages, 11 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is devoted to the theory of $GL_n({\mathbb Z})$-conjugacy classes of regular integer $n\times n$ matrices. Such a matrix is $GL_n({\mathbb Q})$-conjugate to the companion matrix of its characteristic polynomial. But the set of $GL_n({\mathbb Z})$-conjugacy classes of regular integer matrices with a fixed characteristic polynomial $f$ is usually nontrivial (finite if $f$ has simple roots, infinite if $f$ has multiple roots). It is in 1:1-correspondence to a subsemigroup of a certain quotient semigroup of the commutative semigroup of full lattices in the algebra ${\mathbb Q}[t]/(f)$. In its first part, the paper gives a survey on old and new results on full lattices and orders in a finite dimensional commutative ${\mathbb Q}$-algebra with unit element and on induced semigroups. In its longer second part, the paper applies this theory to many examples, essentially all cases with $n=2$, many cases with $n=3$ and two cases with arbitrary $n$, the case with $n$ different integer eigenvalues and the case of a single $n\times n$ Jordan block.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15726v1'>2602.15726</a>\]&nbsp; **Minimal Projective Resolutions, Möbius Inversion, and Bottleneck Stability**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hideto Asashiba, Amit K. Patel &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a stability theory for minimal projective resolutions of $\mathbf{P}$-modules, where $\mathbf{P}$ is a finite metric poset. On the module side, we introduce the \emph{Galois transport distance}, defined by factoring two modules through a common ``apex'' poset via pairs of Galois insertions and measuring the maximal displacement in the index poset. This construction generalizes the interleaving distance in both the classical one-parameter and multiparameter settings, and yields an extended metric on isomorphism classes of $\mathbf{P}$-modules. On the homological side, we define a bottleneck distance between minimal projective resolutions by matching indecomposable projectives degreewise, with contractible cones playing the role of diagonal terms. Our main theorem shows that this resolution-level bottleneck distance is always bounded above by the Galois transport distance, providing a metric stability result formulated entirely at the level of modules and their minimal projective resolutions. We then treat persistence as an application. Passing to the interval poset and a kernel construction, we interpret persistence diagrams as minimal projective resolutions of kernel modules and obtain a corresponding stability inequality. In the one-parameter case this recovers classical bottleneck stability, while in the multiparameter setting it extends naturally to signed diagrams arising from minimal projective resolutions. Via a general relationship between minimal projective resolutions and Möbius inversion, these results can be interpreted as a stability theorem for Möbius homology, while remaining entirely phrased in the language of projective resolutions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** M. Bello-Hernández, M. Benito, Ó. Ciaurri, E. Fernández &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 12 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We obtain some results on the asymptotic behavior and zero distribution of the so-called geometric polynomials. The asymptotics is given both on compact subsets of $\C\setminus [-1,0]$ and on compact subsets of the interval $(-1,0)$. The zeros of these polynomials are simple and lie in $(-1,0]$; moreover, the zeros of consecutive polynomials interlace. Its zero distribution is a measure whose density is similar to Cauchy weight. Some orthogonality properties of these polynomials are also proved.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v3

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For connected reductive groups together with a Frobenius root $F$, we show that the cohomology of the structure sheaf and respectively the canonical sheaf for compactified Deligne--Lusztig varieties associated to an element in the free monoid generated by the simple reflections is isomorphic to that of a minimal length element in an $F$-conjugacy class in the Weyl group.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 44 pages in French; added translation in English by Yujie Xu

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $G$ a symplectic or orthogonal $p$-adic group (not necessarily split), or an inner form of a general linear $p$-adic group, we compute the endomorphism algebras of some induced projective generators à la Bernstein of the category of smooth representations of $G$ and show that these algebras are isomorphic to the semi-direct product of a Hecke algebra with parameters by a finite group algebra. Our strategy and parts of our intermediate results apply to a general reductive connected $p$-adic group.</p></details>

> **Comment:** To appear in Bulletin Australian Math. Soc

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f(x) = (x^{2}+1)^{n} - a x^{n} \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ and assume $f(x)$ is irreducible. Let $θ$ be a root of $f(x)$, set $K= \mathbb{Q}(θ)$, and denote by $\mathbb{Z}_{K}$ the ring of integers of $K$. The index of $f$, denoted $\mathrm{ind}(f)$, is the index of $\mathbb{Z}[θ]$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{K}$. A polynomial $f(x)$ is said to be monogenic if $\mathrm{ind}(f) = 1$. In this article, we explicitly compute the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$, and then derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the parameters $a$ and $n$ for $f(x)$ to be monogenic. Furthermore, we provide a complete description of the primes that divide $\mathrm{ind}(f)$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yuhao Cheng &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We continue generalizing Altuğ's work on $\mathsf{GL}_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ in the unramified setting for \emph{Beyond Endoscopy} to the ramified case where ramification occurs at $S=\{\infty,q_1,\dots,q_r\}$ with $2\in S$, after generalizing the first step. We establish a new proof of the $1/4$ bound towards the Ramanujan conjecture for the trace of the cuspidal part in the ramified case, which is also provided by adapting Altuğ's original approach. The proof proceeds in three stages: First, we estimate the contributions from the non-elliptic parts of the trace formula. Then, we apply the main result from our the previous work to isolate the $1$-dimensional representations within the elliptic part. Finally, we employ technical analytic estimates to bound the remainder terms in the elliptic part.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 36 pages, 9 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the decomposition of real numbers into sums of Lüroth sets, which are defined by numbers whose Lüroth expansions have prescribed digit constraints. We establish several results on the congruence modulo 1 of sums of Lüroth sets, including summands with digits bounded above, below, and combinations of the two. We also analyse the Hausdorff dimension of Lüroth sets and their sums. The results extend classical findings on continued fractions to Lüroth expansions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We settle a long-standing problem in the theory of Hecke algebras of complex reflection groups by constructing many (graded) integral cellular bases of these algebras.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that for non-conjugate subgroups $G_1$ and $G_2$ of a finite group $G$ there exists an extension of $G$ (by a finite group) in which the pre-images of $G_1$ and $G_2$ are not isomorphic. This allows us to show that $\mathbb Z$-coset equivalent subgroups of a finite group are not necessarily isomorphic, answering a question of Dipendra Prasad. We also indicate connections to profinite rigidity, anabelian geometry, mapping class groups, and non-arithmetic lattices in Lie groups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 24 pages, 5 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates the construction of space-filling designs for computer experiments. The space-filling property is characterized by the covering and separation radii of a design, which are integrated through the unified criterion of quasi-uniformity. We focus on a special class of designs, known as quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) lattice point sets, and propose two construction algorithms. The first algorithm generates rank-1 lattice point sets as an approximation of quasi-uniform Kronecker sequences, where the generating vector is determined explicitly. As a byproduct of our analysis, we prove that this explicit point set achieves an isotropic discrepancy of $O(N^{-1/d})$. The second algorithm utilizes Korobov lattice point sets, employing the Lenstra--Lenstra--Lovász (LLL) basis reduction algorithm to identify the generating vector that ensures quasi-uniformity. Numerical experiments are provided to validate our theoretical claims regarding quasi-uniformity. Furthermore, we conduct empirical comparisons between various QMC point sets in the context of Gaussian process regression, showcasing the efficacy of the proposed designs for computer experiments.</p></details>

In particular, this holds for local Shimura varieties, for all local Shimura data $(G,[b],\{μ\})$, even for exceptional groups $G$, and extends work of Oswal-Shankar-Zhu-Patel who proved a $p$-adic Borel extension property for Rapoport-Zink spaces. As a corollary, we deduce that all these spaces satisfy a $p$-adic rigid analytic version of Brody hyperbolicity.</p></details>

We use these calculations to establish striking vanishing results for local cohomology modules supported at these nullcone ideals; this is achieved via a careful analysis of the critical local cohomology modules. The vanishing theorems that we prove are sharp in various respects.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 14 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In [GL24], Galashin and Lam discovered that when $k$ and $n$ are coprime, the proportion of subspaces in $\mathrm{Gr}(k,n)(\mathbb{F}_q)$ that lie in the top-dimensional open positroid variety $Π_{k,n}^\circ(\mathbb{F}_q)$ is $|(\mathbb{F}_q^\times)^n|/|\mathbb{F}_{q^n}^\times|$. In this paper, I recover this point count identity by relating the split torus action on $(Π_{k,n}^\circ)_{\mathbb{F}_q}$ and an anisotropic torus action on a $\mathbb{F}_q$ rational form of $Π_{k,n}^\circ$. The main step in the point count argument and the main technical result in this paper is that cyclic rotation acts trivially on the torus-equivariant cohomology of $Π_{k,n}^\circ$ when $k$ and $n$ are coprime.</p></details>

Using the standard description of these objects as left-invariant flat algebraic connections on the trivial vector bundle, modulo algebraic gauge transformations, we recast the classification problem as an explicit moduli problem for constant connections. We prove our main results for semisimple groups, for general linear groups, and more generally for connected reductive groups. For a connected semisimple complex algebraic group, invariant $D$-modules are classified by representations of the finite central kernel of the simply connected cover. For a general linear group, every invariant $D$-module is obtained by pullback along the determinant map, reducing the classification to the one-dimensional torus case. For a connected reductive group, we relate invariant $D$-modules via pullback along the abelianization map. We also derive applications concerning cohomology and the associated local systems for semisimple groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal C= \{k_1<k_2 < \cdots\}$ be Cantor set of integers, that is a set of integers with restricted digits modulo a base $b$, and suppose $0$ is one of the restricted digits. We show that $$ \liminf_N \Expectation_{n\in [N]} m(A\cap T^{-k_n} A \cap \cdots \cap T^{-\ell k_n} A )>0. $$ This is an extension of the IP Ergodic Theorem of Furstenberg and Katznelson, and a partial extension of recent work of Kra and Shalom. In particular, this implies that for any subset of integers $A$ of positive upper Banach density, there is a set $B$ of integers $n$ of positive lower Banach density such that $A$ contains an $\ell+1$ term progression, with step size $k_n$, where $n\in B$. This is a complement to recent results of Kra and Shalom, for IP Sets of integers, and Burgin, concerning Sarkozy's Theorem for Primes with restricted digits.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We associate to a semisimple complex Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ a sequence of polynomials $P_{\ell,\mathfrak{g}}(x)\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$ in $r$ variables, where $r$ is the rank of $\mathfrak{g}$ and $\ell=0,1,2,\ldots $. The polynomials $P_{\ell,\mathfrak{g}}(x)$ are uniquely associated to the isomorphism class of $\mathfrak{g}$, up to re-numbering the variables, and are defined as special values of a variant of Witten's zeta function. Another set of polynomials associated to $\mathfrak{g}$ were defined in 2008 by Komori, Matsumoto and Tsumura using different special values of another variant of Witten's zeta function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For relatively prime natural numbers $a$ and $b$, we study the two equations $ax+by = (a-1)(b-1)/2$ and $ax+by+1= (a-1)(b-1)/2$, which arise from the study of cyclotomic polynomials. Previous work showed that exactly one equation has a nonnegative solution, and the solution is unique. Our first result gives criteria to determine which equation is used for a given pair $(a,b)$. We then use the criteria to study the sequence of equations used by the pair $(a_n/\gcd{(a_n, a_{n+1})}, a_{n+1}/\gcd{(a_n, a_{n+1})})$ from several special sequences $(a_n)_{n\geq 1}$. Finally, fixing $k \in \mathbb{N}$, we investigate the periodicity of the sequence of equations used by the pair $(k/\gcd{(k, n)}, n/\gcd{(k, n)})$ as $n$ increases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study congruences modulo powers of a prime $p$ between pairs of $p$-new modular Hecke eigenforms of level $Γ_0(p)$ and same weight $k$. Based on explicit computations, we conjecture that every such eigenform $f$ admits a twin to which it is congruent modulo a surprisingly high power of $p$, whose exponent is close to the opposite of the valuation of the $\mathcal L$-invariant of $f$, and whose Atkin--Lehner sign is opposite to that of $f$. This is a new phenomenon that is not explained by the known results on the $p$-adic variation of eigenforms. Inspired by the global picture, we formulate a local conjecture describing congruences between semistable representations of fixed weight, varying $\mathcal L$-invariant, and opposite Atkin--Lehner signs. We give some theoretical evidence towards our conjectures.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 27 pages. No figures. Part of a six-paper series on Algebraic Phase Theory

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop the representation theory intrinsic to Algebraic Phase Theory (APT) in regimes where defect and canonical filtration admit faithful algebraic realisation. This extends the framework introduced in earlier work by incorporating a representation-theoretic layer that is compatible with defect and filtration. In this setting, algebraic phases act naturally on filtered module categories rather than on isolated objects, and classical irreducibility must be replaced by a filtration-compatible notion of indecomposability forced by defect. As a central application, we analyse the Frobenius Heisenberg algebraic phase, which occupies a rigid boundary regime within the broader APT landscape, and show that it satisfies the axioms of APT in a strongly admissible form. We study the representations realising this phase and show that their non-semisimplicity and rigidity properties are consequences of the underlying algebraic structure rather than analytic or semisimple hypotheses. In particular, we establish a Stone von Neumann type rigidity theorem for Heisenberg groups associated with finite Frobenius rings. For each such ring $R$, we construct a canonical Schrödinger representation of the Frobenius Heisenberg group $H_R$, and show that, for a fixed nontrivial central character, every centrally faithful representation of $H_R$ is equivalent to this model. The proof is entirely algebraic and uses no topology, unitarity, Fourier analysis, or semisimplicity. Instead, rigidity emerges as a boundary phenomenon governed by defect and canonical filtration. The Frobenius hypothesis is shown to be sharp: it precisely delineates the structural boundary within APT at which Heisenberg rigidity persists, and outside the Frobenius class this rigidity necessarily fails.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The full lattices in a finite dimensional commutative ${\mathbb Q}$-algebra form a commutative semigroup. In the case of an algebraic number field the top part of a certain quotient semigroup is the class group. For a separable algebra some basic results, especially the Jordan-Zassenhaus theorem, are known for this quotient semigroup. This paper considers also algebras which are not separable. It studies the commutative semigroup of full lattices in such an algebra and also the quotient semigroup. This leads in this commutative, but not separable situation to a certain extension of the Jordan-Zassenhaus theorem. One application concerns $GL_n({\mathbb Z})$-conjugacy classes of regular integer $n\times n$ matrices.</p></details>

An unpublished theorem of Clozel, proven with global techniques, says that the class of essentially square-integrable representations is also defined over $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$. As an application of our main result, we give a local proof of this theorem for $G=\mathrm{GL}_n$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 30 pages, added Section 6 to prove connection with arXiv:2602.03659

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite-dimensional algebra $Λ$ over an algebraically closed field $K$, it is known that the poset of $2$-term silting objects in $\mathrm{K}^b(\mathrm{proj}Λ)$ is isomorphic to the poset of functorially finite torsion classes in $\mathrm{mod}Λ$, and to that of complete cotorsion classes in $\mathrm{K}^{[-1,0]}(\mathrm{proj}Λ)$. In this work, we generalise this result to the case of $d$-term silting objects for arbitrary $d\geq 2$ by introducing the notion of torsion classes for extriangulated categories. In particular, we show that the poset of $d$-term silting objects in $\mathrm{K}^b(\mathrm{proj}Λ)$ is isomorphic to the poset of complete and hereditary cotorsion classes in $\mathrm{K}^{[-d+1,0]}(\mathrm{proj}Λ)$, and to that of positive and functorially finite torsion classes in $D^{[-d+2,0]}(\mathrm{mod}Λ)$, an extension-closed subcategory of $D^b(\mathrm{mod}Λ)$. We further show that the posets $\mathrm{cotors}\mathrm{K}^{[-d+1,0]}(\mathrm{proj}Λ)$ and $\mathrm{tors} D^{[-d+2,0]}(\mathrm{mod}Λ)$ are lattices, and that the truncation functor $τ_{\geq -d+2}$ gives an isomorphism between the two.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $U$ be a maximal unipotent subgroup in a symplectic group over a finite field of sufficiently large characteristic $p$. According to the Kirillov's orbit method, the coadjoint orbits of the group $U$ play the key role in the description of irreducible complex characters of $U$. Almost all important classes of orbits and characters studied to the moment can be uniformly described as the orbits and characters associated with so-called orthogonal rook placements. In the paper, we construct a semi-direct decomposition for the corresponding irreducible characters in the spirit of the Mackey little group method. As a corollary, we present an explicit formula for the character corresponding to an orbit of maximal possible dimension.</p></details>

This leads us to study the distribution of characters in unipotent blocks of disconnected reductive groups and show that this is well-behaved under a generalization of $d$-Harish-Chandra theory. We go on to study the blockwise Galois--McKay (also known as the Alperin--McKay--Navarro) conjecture for the blocks of almost (quasi-)simple groups above unipotent blocks.</p></details>

Furthermore, we extend the notion of equivariant multiplicity to wobbly components and compute it for Hilbert schemes of two points. Inspired by Eisenstein series functor in Dolbeault Langlands correspondence, we propose that upward flows of very stable ideals are mirror dual to modified Procesi bundles, and justify this claim through numerical checks. Finally, we make some conjectures about extending this picture to wobbly upward flows.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We complete the classification of torsion subgroups $E(K)_{\text{tors}}$ that can occur for an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ over a sextic number field $K$. Previous work determined the complete set of these groups, leaving the existence of only one group in question: $C_3 \oplus C_{18}$. We prove that this group does not occur. Our proof relies on the theory of Galois representations attached to elliptic curves. The assumed existence of a $C_3 \oplus C_{18}$ torsion subgroup would impose strong, simultaneous constraints on the mod-$2$ and $3$-adic Galois representations of the curve. By applying the recent classification of $\ell$-adic Galois images for elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$, we translate these arithmetic constraints into a problem of Diophantine geometry: the $j$-invariant of such a curve must correspond to a rational point on one of the finitely many modular curves. We then analyze these curves using classical methods and show that none have the necessary rational points corresponding to elliptic curves without complex multiplication, thereby proving our main result.</p></details>

We introduce an equivalent reformulation of these conjectures while constructing two new explicit analytical formulas. The first formula, which is a special case of the second, is based on a divisibility condition, whereas the second, more general formula, relies on the existence of a perfect square, which we conjecture to always hold. Under these conditions, the formulas verify the conjectures even for very large numerical values. Moreover, our method reduces the problem to the search for a suitable perfect square, thereby opening the way to a complete proof of these conjectures. In conclusion, we present open questions and conjectures to the mathematical community regarding the generalization of these formulas.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the triple convolution sum of the generalised divisor functions $$\sum_{n\leq x} d_k(n+h)d_l(n)d_m(n-h),$$ where $h \le x^{1-ε}$ for any $ε>0$ and $d_k(n)$ denotes the generalised divisor function which counts the number of ways $n$ can be written as a product of $k$ many positive integers. The purpose of this paper is three-fold. Firstly, we note a predicted asymptotic estimate for the above sum, where the constant appearing in the estimate can be obtained from the theory of Dirichlet series of several complex variables and also using some probabilistic arguments. Then we show that a lower bound of the correct order can be derived using the several variable Tauberian theorems, where, more importantly, the constant in the predicted asymptotic can be recovered. Lastly, in the spirit of the Titchmarsh divisor problem, we consider this triple convolution sum over the prime numbers, which essentially leads to a shifted convolution sum. We use the Tauberian theory of multiple Dirichlet series along with the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem to derive an explicit lower bound of this.</p></details>

> **Comment:** There is a gap in the proof of Theorem 3.1

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite-dimensional algebra Λ, we establish an explicit bijection between widely generated torsion(-free) classes and semibricks in mod Λ. Using the kappa order on the lattice of torsion classes with canonical join representations, we provide several equivalent conditions for brick-finite algebras. We show that Λ is brick-finite if and only if any chain of wide subcategories of mod Λ becomes eventually constant, if and only if any torsion class in mod Λ has finitely many covers, if and only if every semibrick in mod Λ is a finite set. Thus, we give a proof of Enomoto's conjecture (Adv. Math., 393 (2021), 108113). As a consequence, we show that Λ is brick-finite if and only if every wide subcategory closed under coproducts of Mod Λ is closed under products, if and only if every wide subcategory of mod Λ is functorially finite. This gives a positive answer to the question posed by Angeleri Hügel and Sentieri (J. Algebra, 664 (2025), 164-205).</p></details>

> **Comment:** 22 pages. This paper generalizes Part 1 of "Complete affine manifolds with Anosov holonomy groups,'' ArXiv:2009.11127, and Part 2 is dropped. The main setting has changed over to flat vector bundles. This involved many changes. Part 2 is still available at ArXiv:2009.11127. Furthermore, we generalized the premise of the main theorem to include a subexponential growth condition on singular values

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $N$ be a manifold of dimension $m$ with a flat vector bundle given by a representation $ρ:π_1(N) \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbf{R})$ where $π_1(N)$ is finitely generated. The holonomy group $ρ$ is a $k$-partially hyperbolic holonomy representation if the flat bundle pulled back over the unit tangent bundle of a sufficiently large compact submanifold of $N$ splits into expanding, neutral, and contracting subbundles along the geodesic flow, where the expanding and contracting subbundles are $k$-dimensional with $k < n/2$. Suppose that each element of $ρ(π_1(N))$ has an eigenvalue of norm $1$, or, alternatively, $ρ$ has some singular values of subexponential growth in terms of word length. We show that $ρ$ is a $P$-Anosov representation for a parabolic subgroup $P$ of $\mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbf{R})$ if and only if $ρ$ is a partially hyperbolic representation. We are going to primarily employ representation theory techniques. As an application, we will show that the equivalence holds when $N$ is a complete affine $n$-manifold, and $ρ$ is a linear part of the holonomy representation. This had never been done over the full general linear group.</p></details>

We show that a quandle $Q$ and its image in the enveloping group $G(Q)$ have isomorphic enveloping groups. The image quandle is injective. For $Q$ a finite quandle, we show that $G(Q)$ admits a faithfull representation $ρ: G(Q)\to GL_n(\mathbb{Z})$ for some $n$; an irreducible representation of $G(Q)$ over $\mathbb{C}$ is finite dimensional an its degree divides the order of the group $Inn(Q)$ of inner automorphism of $Q$ and is bounded by $\sqrt{\vert Inn(Q) \vert }$. We determine the Malcev Lie algebra and the rational cohomology ring of $G(Q)$ for $Q$ finite. We prove that a finite injective quandle is a subquandle (for conjugacy) of a finite group. We also prove that the only finite subquandles (for conjugacy) of uniquely divisible groups are trivial quandles and that morphisms from quandles to nilpotent groups (for conjugacy) are constant on the indecomposable components.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study the so-called {\it weakly $\sqrt{J}U$ rings} (hereafter abbreviated as {\it $W\sqrt{J}U$ rings} for short), in which every unit is of the form $j+1$ or $j-1$ for some $j$ in $\sqrt{J(R)} : = \{x \in R : x^n \in J(R) \text{ for some } n\ge 1\}$. This class of rings non-trivially generalizes the classes of $\sqrt{J}U$, $UU$, $JU$, $WUU$ and $WJU$ rings, respectively. We investigate their basic properties showing that they are Dedekind-finite, that $M_n(R)$ is never $W\sqrt{J}U$ for $n\ge 2$, and that when $\mathrm{char}(R)>0$ it must be equal to $2^α3^β$ for some $α, β\in \mathbb{N} \cup \left\{ 0 \right\}$. Moreover, for group rings $RG$, we prove that if $RG$ is $W\sqrt{J}U$, then $R$ is $W\sqrt{J}U$ and $G$ is a torsion group. In addition, when $R$ has positive characteristic and $G$ is a locally finite $p$-group, we give a complete characterization like this: $RG$ is a $W\sqrt{J}U$ ring if, and only if, either $R$ is a $\sqrt{J}U$ ring and $G$ is a $2$-group, or $R$ is a $W\sqrt{J}U$ ring with $3\in J(R)$ and $G$ is a $3$-group, or $R\cong R_1\times R_2$ with $R_1$ a $\sqrt{J}U$ ring, $R_2$ a $W\sqrt{J}U$ ring and $G$ a trivial group. Our results substantially improve on recent achievements due to Saini and Udar in Czech. Math. J. (2025).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The monograph develops a self-contained, mathematically rigorous framework for massless representations of the conformal group U(2,2) and their restriction to the de Sitter group Sp(2,2). It systematically constructs ladder (massless) representations, computes invariant bilinear forms and Casimir operators, and provides explicit constructions of vertex operators and two-point functions for low-helicity fields. The monograph employs a novel Clifford-split-octonion approach, embedding 8-component Majorana spinors within an alternative composition algebra, which allows for fully explicit algebraic, spinorial, and geometric constructions. The text bridges foundational representation theory, explicit computational methods, and physical applications in quantum field theory and cosmology. While targeted at researchers in mathematical physics, quantum cosmology, and quantum field theory, the exposition is pedagogically structured to guide advanced graduate students through subtle algebraic and representation-theoretic ideas, making complex constructions accessible without sacrificing rigor.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>While the value of the radius of convergence of the generating series of the Catalan numbers is well-known, obtaining it solely from recurrence relations is less immediate. It is sometimes considered that no known proof establishes that the radius $R$ equals 1/4 without relying on the explicit closed formula for the Catalan numbers. In particular, it has been shown that one can obtain, at the cost of substantial technical effort and without resorting to the main Segner recursion relation or to the explicit formula for the Catalan number, the lower bound $R\geq 1/6$. In this work, we prove that Touchard's recurrence alone yields the optimal exponential upper bound $\limsup_{n\to\infty} C_n^{1/n} \le 4$, which implies $R \ge 1/4$. Combined with the classical lower estimate $\limsup_{n\to\infty} C_n^{1/n} \ge 4$, obtained from central binomial coefficients, this gives $R = 1/4$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: cleverref issue solved

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Initiated in work by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten, the area known as $τ$-tilting theory plays a fundamental role in contemporary representation theory. In this paper we explore a higher-dimensional analogue of this theory, formulated with respect to the higher Auslander-Reiten translation $τ_d$. In particular, we associate to any functorially finite $d$-torsion class a maximal $τ_d$-rigid pair and a $(d+1)$-term silting complex. In the case $d=1$, the notions of maximal $τ_d$-rigid and support $τ$-tilting pairs coincide, and our theory recovers the classical bijections. However, the proof strategies for $d>1$ differ significantly. As an intermediate step, we prove that a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of a module category induces a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of the category of $(d+1)$-term complexes, producing novel examples of $d$-exact categories. We introduce the notion of a $d$-torsion class in the exact setup, and use this to obtain the aforementioned $(d+1)$-term silting complex. We moreover apply our theory to study $d$-APR tilting modules and slices. To illustrate our results, we provide explicit combinatorial descriptions of maximal $τ_d$-rigid pairs and $(d+1)$-term silting complexes for higher Auslander and higher Nakayama algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The equivalence classes of irreducible representations of wreath product $\mathfrak{S}_n(T) = T^n \rtimes \mathfrak{S}_n$ of finite group $T$ with respect to symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ are parametrized by $\mathbb{Y}_n(\widehat{T})$, the $\lvert \widehat{T}\rvert$-tuple Young diagrams with total size $n$. We show a formula connecting the Kerov transition measures of these Young diagrams with the Jucys--Murphy elements of $\mathfrak{S}_n(T)$. This formula is due to Biane in the case of symmetric groups. The formula enables us to investigate asymptotic property of the shapes of multi-diagrams through combinatorial analysis for the Jucys--Murphy elements. On the other hand, a Markov chain is introduced on $\mathbb{Y}_n(\widehat{T})$, canonically reflecting the branching rule for the tower of wreath product groups. We have a continuous time stochastic process on $\mathbb{Y}_n(\widehat{T})$ from this chain by replacing the discrete time by a counting process. Our project is to specify the deterministic limit shape of multi-diagrams at each macroscopic time through appropriate space-time scaling limit, and to describe evolution of related quantities characterizing the shape. Especially, we derive dynamical concentrated limit shapes in the case of abelian $T$ by using free probability tools under the assumption of approximate factorization property for initial ensembles with an additional property of a pausing time distribution.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 71 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In our previous paper with Tudor Pădurariu, we introduced the notion of limit categories for moduli stacks of Higgs bundles and formulated the Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence. These limit categories are expected to provide an effective ``classical limit'' of the categories of D-modules on the moduli stack of bundles, and our formulation links categorical Donaldson-Thomas theory with the geometric Langlands correspondence. In this paper, we prove the above Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ over the locus in the Hitchin base where the spectral curves are reduced. This is the first non-trivial case in which the relevant moduli stacks are not quasi-compact, and the use of limit categories is essential to the formulation and proof of the correspondence. Our approach also outlines a strategy for proving the correspondence in greater generality and explains the current obstructions to such an extension.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1994, Kani introduced an algebraic version of the Humbert invariant, known as the refined Humbert invariant. This invariant q_C is a positive definite quadratic form attached to a smooth curve C of genus 2.

When the Jacobian J_C of a genus 2 curve C is isogenous to a product of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication, the forms q_C have been completely classified recently. In this paper, building upon this classification, we present a constructive algorithm that produces J_C and a divisorial representative of a curve C of genus 2 such that its refined Humbert invariant q_C is equivalent to a given integral ternary quadratic form.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a Galois number field $K$, the Galois group $\text{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$ acts on the class group $Cl_K$ in a very natural way: $σ\cdot[I]=[σ(I)]$ for any $σ\in \text{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$, $[I]\in Cl_K$. In this paper, we will explore how the unique properties of this group action work together to elucidate the relationship between these two groups. While previous work on this problem has focused on representation theory, we take a direct approach to some classical and new problems. The paper concludes with an exploration of the class groups of overrings of the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$. These turn out to be powerful tools for understanding $Cl_K$ and overrings of $\mathcal{O}_K$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Include several non-trivial self-similar sets whose intersections with the $τ$-approximable set have the desired Hausdorff dimension

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K\subset\mathbb R^d$ be a compact subset equipped with a $δ$-Ahlfors regular measure $μ$. For any $τ>1/d$ and any ``inhomogeneous'' vector $\boldsymbolθ\in\mathbb R^d$, let $W_d(ψ_τ,\boldsymbolθ)$ denote the set of $(ψ_τ,\boldsymbolθ)$-well approximable numbers, where $ψ_τ(q)=q^{-τ}$. Assuming a local estimate for the $μ$-measure of the intersections of $K$ with the neighborhoods of ``rational'' vectors $(\mathbf p+\boldsymbolθ)/q$, we establish a sharp upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of $K\cap W_d(ψ_τ,\boldsymbolθ)$, together with some nontrivial lower bounds when $τ$ is below a certain threshold. One of the lower bounds becomes sharp in the one-dimensional homogeneous case ($d=1$, $θ=0$) for a class of sufficiently thick self-similar sets $K$, and moreover $K\cap W_1(ψ_τ,0)$ has full $(δ+\frac{2}{1+τ}-1)$-Hausdorff measure. These results have several applications: (1) the set of homogeneous very well approximable numbers has full Hausdorff dimension within strongly irreducible self-similar sets in $\mathbb R^d$, extending a recent result of Chen [arXiv:2510.17096]; (2) the set of inhomogeneous very well approximable numbers has full Hausdorff dimension within sufficiently thick missing digits sets in $\mathbb R$, affirmatively answering a question posed by Yu [arXiv:2101.05910]. Our applications build on the seminal works of Yu [arXiv:2101.05910] and Bénard, He and Zhang [arXiv:2508.09076]. We also provide some non-trivial missing digits set $K\subset[0,1]^d$ whose intersection with $W_d(ψ_τ,0)$ has full $(δ+\frac{1+d}{1+τ}-d)$-Hausdorff measure.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We explicitly describe the derived Picard groups of symmetric representation-finite algebras of type $D$. In particular, we prove that these groups are generated by spherical twists along collections of $0$-spherical objects, the shift and autoequivalences which come from outer automorphisms of a particular representative of the derived equivalence class. The arguments we use are based on the fact that symmetric representation-finite algebras are tilting-connected. To apply this result we in particular develop a combinatorial-geometric model for silting mutations in type $D$, generalising the classical concepts of Brauer trees and Kauer moves. Another key ingredient in the proof is the faithfulness of the braid group action via spherical twists along $D$-configurations of $0$-spherical objects.</p></details>

Moreover, the condition on the first digit of a representation for the value of the function is more general than conditions considered before. The main object of study is a continuous function defined by equality \begin{gather*} f(Δ^{s^*}_{α_1α_2\ldotsα_n\ldots}) = Δ^{2^*}_{β_1β_2\ldotsβ_n\ldots}, \quad α_n \in \{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots, s - 1 \} \equiv A_s, β_1 = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if $α_1 \in A_0$}, 1 & \text{if $α_1 \in A_1$}, \end{cases} \quad β_{n+1} = \begin{cases} β_n & \text{if $α_{n+1} = α_n$}, 1 - β_n & \text{if $α_{n+1} \neq α_n$}. \end{cases} \end{gather*} where $Δ^{s^*}_{α_1α_2\ldotsα_n\ldots}$ is an $s$-symbol representation of a number $x \in [0, 1]$ that is topologically equivalent to the classical $s$-adic representation, $Δ^{2^*}_{β_1β_2\ldotsβ_n\ldots}$ is a two-symbol representation that is topologically equivalent to the classical binary representation, and $A_0 \cup A_1 = A_s$, $A_0 \neq A_s \neq A_1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given $β\in(1,2]$, let $T_β$ be the $β$-transformation on the unit circle $[0,1)$ such that $T_β(x)=βx\pmod 1$. For each $t\in[0,1)$ let $K_β(t)$ be the survivor set consisting of all $x\in[0,1)$ whose orbit $\{T^n_β(x): n\ge 0\}$ never hits the open interval $(0,t)$. Kalle et al. proved in [Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems, 40 (9): 2482--2514, 2020] that the Hausdorff dimension function $t\mapsto\dim_H K_β(t)$ is a non-increasing Devil's staircase. So there exists a critical value $τ(β)$ such that $\dim_H K_β(t)>0$ if and only if $t<τ(β)$. In this paper we determine the critical value $τ(β)$ for all $β\in(1,2]$, answering a question of Kalle et al. (2020). For example, we find that for the Komornik-Loreti constant $β\approx 1.78723$ we have $τ(β)=(2-β)/(β-1)$. Furthermore, we show that (i) the function $τ: β\mapstoτ(β)$ is left continuous on $(1,2]$ with right-hand limits everywhere, but has countably infinitely many discontinuities; (ii) $τ$ has no downward jumps, with $τ(1+)=0$ and $τ(2)=1/2$; and (iii) there exists an open set $O\subset(1,2]$, whose complement $(1,2]\setminus O$ has zero Hausdorff dimension, such that $τ$ is real-analytic, convex and strictly decreasing on each connected component of $O$. Our strategy to find the critical value $τ(β)$ depends on certain substitutions of Farey words and a renormalization scheme from dynamical systems.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In arXiv:2401.00636 we introduced the notion of a periodic pencil of flat connections on a smooth variety $X$. Namely, a pencil is a linear family of flat connections $\nabla(s_1,...,s_n)=d-\sum_{i=1}^r\sum_{j=1}^ns_jB_{ij}dx_i,$ where $\lbrace x_i\rbrace$ are coordinates on $X$ and $B_{ij}: X\to {\rm Mat}_N$ are matrix-valued regular functions. A pencil is periodic if it is generically invariant under the shifts $s_j\mapsto s_j+1$ up to isomorphism. In this paper we show that in characteristic $p>0$, the $p$-curvature operators $\lbrace C_i,1\le i\le r\rbrace$ of a periodic pencil $\nabla$ are isospectral to the commuting endomorphisms $C_i^*:=\sum_{j=1}^n (s_j-s_j^p)B_{ij}^{(1)}$, where $B_{ij}^{(1)}$ is the Frobenius twist of $B_{ij}$. Using the results of arXiv:2401.00636, this allows us to compute the eigenvalues of the $p$-curvature for many important examples of pencils of flat connections, including Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ), Casimir, and Dunkl connections, their confluent limits, and equivariant quantum connections for conical symplectic resolutions with finitely many torus fixed points. In particular, for rational values of parameters these eigenvalues are zero, so the connections are globally nilpotent. We also show that every periodic pencil has regular singularites and its residues have rational eigenvalues for rational values of parameters. In particular, this holds for the aforementioned quantum connections if they have rational coefficients. Also we generalize these results to irregular pencils (KZ, Casimir, Dunkl, and Toda), and relate them in the Dunkl case to representations of rational Cherednik algebras. Finally, we extend our main result to pseudo-pencils and discuss the generalization to difference equations.</p></details>

In 1967 Hooley proved a conditional asymptotic formula $π(u,x)=δ(u)x(\log x)^{-1}+O(\log\log x(\log x)^{-2}$ for the primitive root conjecture. This note proves an unconditional asymptotic formula $π(u,x)=δ(u)x(\log x)^{-1}+O(x(\log x)^{-2}$ of the same result, where $δ(u)>0$ is the density constant.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unconditionally, we prove the Iwaniec-Sarnak conjecture for $L^4$-norms of the Hecke-Maass cusp forms. From this result, we can justify that for even Maass cusp form $φ$ with the eigenvalue $λ_φ=\frac{1}{4}+t_φ^2$, for $a>0$, a sufficiently large $h>0$ and for any $0<ε_1<ε/10^7$ ($ε>0$) , for almost all $1\le k<t_φ^{1-ε}$, we are able to find $β_k=\{X_k+yi:a<y<a+h\}$ with $-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{k-1}{t_φ^{1-ε}}\le X_k\le-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{k}{t_φ^{1-ε}}$ such that the number of sign changes of $φ$ along the segment $β_k$ is $\gg_ε t_φ^{1-ε_1}$ as $t_φ\to\infty$. Also, we obtain the similar result for horizontal lines. On the other hand, we conditionally prove that for a sufficiently large segment $β$ on $\textrm{Re}(z)=0$ and $\textrm{Im}(z)>0$, the number of sign changes of $φ$ along $β$ is $\gg_ε t_φ^{1-ε}$ and consequently, the number of inert nodal domains meeting any compact vertical segment on the imaginary axis is $\gg_ε t_φ^{1-ε}$ as $t_φ\to\infty$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give an elementary proof of the statement that if an idempotent complete preadditive category has weak kernels and weak cokernels, then it has $n$-kernels if and only if it has $n$-cokernels, where $n$ is a nonnegative integer. As a consequence, elementary proofs of two results concerning the equality between the global dimensions of certain right and left module categories are obtained.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a number field $F$ with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_{F}$, one can associate to any torsion free subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathcal{O}_{F})$ of finite index a complete Riemannian manifold of finite volume with fibered cusp ends. For natural choices of flat vector bundles on such a manifold, we show that analytic torsion is identified with the Reidemeister torsion of the Borel-Serre compactification. This is used to obtain exponential growth of torsion in the cohomology for sequences of congruence subgroups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that any (n+1)-term silting complex whose intermediate cohomology vanishes gives rise to an n-silting module, as recently introduced by Mao. Specializing to commutative noetherian rings, we show that this assignment induces a bijection on the respective equivalence classes. Furthermore, we prove in the same setting that the n-silting modules always correspond to a tilting complex, that is, the associated t-structure is of derived type. We use this to exhibit new examples of tilting complexes in the setting of Commutative Algebra and also to show that the finite type property for n-silting modules, as formulated by Mao, can in general fail.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We classify irreducible integrable modules with finite-dimensional weight spaces for toroidal Lie algebras coordinated by rational quantum torus with trivial central action. Let $\mathbb{C}_q$ denote the rational quantum torus associated with a rational quantum matrix $q$, and let $\hatτ(d,q)$ be the toroidal Lie algebra coordinated by rational quantum torus obtained by adjoining the derivation space $D$ to the universal central extension $\tildeτ(d,q)=\mathfrak{sl}_d(\mathbb{C}_q)\oplus HC_1(\mathbb{C}_q)$ of $\mathfrak{sl}_d(\mathbb{C}_q)$. The case of nontrivial central action was previously classified by S. Eswara Rao and K. Zhao. The present work completes the classification by describing all irreducible integrable $\hatτ(d,q)$-modules with finite-dimensional weight spaces in the case where the $n$-dimensional center $C$ acts trivially on the modules.</p></details>
