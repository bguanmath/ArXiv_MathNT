 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Shenghao Hua &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** The proof is incorrect

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a one-sided central limit theorem for the logarithms of regulators of a fixed rational non-CM elliptic curve $E$ over imaginary quadratic fields of rank one, motivated by the Gross--Zagier formula and a result of Radziwi\l\l and Soundararajan. We also establish the existence of many imaginary quadratic fields whose regulators grow at least as fast as the square root of the conductor of the field. When the central value of the $L$-function of $E$ is non-vanishing, these results also hold for the regulator of the quadratic twist $E^{(d)}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Moreover, assuming the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, we obtain the uniform boundedness of the Shafarevich--Tate groups and Tamagawa numbers for these rank-one quadratic twists.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates the dynamical properties of Dickson polynomials over finite fields, focusing on the periodicity and structural behavior of their iterated sequences. We introduce and analyze the sequence $[D_n(x, \alpha) \mod (x^q - x)]_n$, where $D_n(x, \alpha)$ denotes a Dickson polynomial of the first kind, and explore its periodic nature when reduced modulo $x^q - x$. We derive explicit formulas for the period of these sequences, particularly in the case when $n$ is coprime to $q^2 - 1$. In addition, we identify a symmetric property of the polynomial coefficients that plays a crucial role in the analysis of these sequences. Using tools from combinatorics, elementary number theory, and finite fields, we present algorithms to compute the exact period and investigate the dynamical structure of these polynomials. We also highlight open problems in cases where the degree $n$ is not coprime to $q^2 - 1$. Our results offer deep insights into the algebraic structure of Dickson polynomials and their role in dynamical systems over finite fields.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Thanasis Bouganis, Jolanta Marzec-Ballesteros &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is well known that there is a deep relationship between codes and lattices. Concepts from coding theory are related to concepts of lattice theory as, for example, weight enumerators to theta series, MacWilliams identity to Jacobi identity, and Gleason's theorem to Hecke's theorem. In this framework, higher-genus (or multiple) weight enumerators are related to Siegel theta series, which opens up the possibility of introducing concepts from the theory of higher-rank modular forms to coding theory. There has been important work in this direction, for example Runge introduced a coding theory analogue of Siegel's $\Phi$-operator and Nebe analogues of Hecke operators. In this paper, we show that the celebrated Doubling Method from the theory of higher-rank modular forms has a coding theory analogue. Given the impact that the Doubling Method has had in the study of higher-rank modular forms, one may expect that its analogue may prove useful to the study of higher-genus weight enumerators. In this paper we use it to solve an analogue of the "basis problem". That is, we express "cuspidal" polynomials which are invariant under a Clifford-Weil type group as an explicit linear combination of higher-genus weight enumerators of self-dual codes of that type.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 55 pages. Version 2: improved exposition and rewrote various statements; the proof of Theorem 2 now does not rely on the auxilliary conical $\mathbb{C}^\times$-action

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a complex reductive group $G$ and a $G$-representation $\mathbf{N}$, there is an associated Coulomb branch algebra $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^\hbar$ defined by Braverman, Finkelberg and Nakajima. In this paper, we provide a new interpretation of $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^\hbar$ as the largest subcomodule of the equivariant Borel--Moore homology of the affine Grassmannian on which shift operators (and their deformations induced by flavour symmetries) admit non-equivariant limits. The proofs of the main theorems involve showing that the defining equations of the Coulomb branch algebras reflect the properness of moduli spaces required for defining shift operators. As a main application, we give a very general definition of shift operators, and show that if $X$ is a smooth semiprojective variety equipped with a $G$-action, and $f \colon X \to \mathbf{N}$ is a $G$-equivariant proper holomorphic map, then the equivariant big quantum cohomology $QH^\bullet_G(X)$ defines a family of closed Lagrangians in the Coulomb branch $\mathrm{Spec}\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}$, yielding a transformation of 3d branes in 3d mirror symmetry. We further apply our construction to recover Teleman's gluing formula for Coulomb branches and to derive new generalizations of the Peterson isomorphism.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Benjamin Baily, Amichai Lampert &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Improved exposition

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f$ be a homogeneous polynomial over a field. For many fields, including number fields and function fields, we prove that the strength of $f$ is bounded above by a constant multiple of the Birch rank of $f.$ The constant depends only on the degree of $f$ and the absolute transcendence degree of the field. This is the first linear bound obtained for forms of degree greater than three, partially resolving a conjecture of Adiprasito, Kazhdan and Ziegler. Our result has applications for the Hardy-Littlewood circle method. The circle method yields an asymptotic formula for counting integral zeros of (collections of) homogeneous polynomials, provided the Birch rank is sufficiently large -- a natural geometric condition. Our main theorem implies that these formulas hold even if we only assume a similar lower bound on the strength of the (collection of) homogeneous polynomials -- an arithmetic condition which is a priori weaker. This answers questions of Cook-Magyar and Skinner, and also yields a new proof of a seminal result of Schmidt as a consequence of Birch's earlier work. Over finite fields we obtain a quasi-linear bound for partition rank of tensors in terms of analytic rank, improving Moshkovitz-Zhu's state of the art bound.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using spectral flow, we provide a proof of [9, Theorem 9.17] on unitarity of Ramond twisted non-extremal representations of minimal $W$-algebras that does not rely on the still conjectural exactness of the twisted quantum reduction functor (see Conjecture 9.11 of [9]). When $\mathfrak g=spo(2|2n)$, $F(4)$, $D(2,1;\frac{m}{n})$, it is also proven that the unitarity of extremal (=massless) representations of the minimal $W$-algebra $W^k_{\min}(\mathfrak g)$ in the Ramond sector is equivalent to the unitarity of extremal representations in the Neveu-Schwarz sector.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the triple convolution sum of the divisor function given by $$\sum_{n\leq x} d(n)d(n-h)d(n+h)$$ for $h\neq 0$ and $d(n)$ denotes the number of positive divisors of $n$. Based on algebraic and geometric considerations, Browning conjectured that the above sum is asymptotic to $c_hx(\log x)^3$, for a suitable constant $c_h\neq 0$, as $x\to \infty$. This conjecture is still unproved. Using sieve-theoretic results of Wolke and Nair (respectively), it is possible to derive the exact order of the sum. The lower bound of the correct order of magnitude can also be derived by very elementary arguments. In this paper, using the Tauberian theory for multiple Dirichlet series, we prove an explicit lower bound and provide a new theoretical framework to predict Browning's conjectured constant $c_h$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nikola Gyulev, Miroslav Marinov &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 10 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2016, Dummit, Granville, and Kisilevsky showed that the proportion of semiprimes (products of two primes) not exceeding a given $x$, whose factors are congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, is more than a quarter when $x$ is sufficiently large. They have also conjectured that this holds from the very beginning, that is, for all $x \geq 9$. Here we give a proof of this conjecture. For $x\geq 1.1 \cdot 10^{13}$ we take an explicit approach based on their work. We rely on classical estimates for prime counting functions, as well as on very recent explicit improvements by Bennett, Martin, O'Bryant, and Rechnitzer, which have wide applications in essentially any setting involving estimations of sums over primes in arithmetic progressions. All $x < 1.1 \cdot 10^{13}$ are covered by a computed assisted verification.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: 40 pages; some additions (mostly explanations, some more explicit calculations), also some cuts and slight re-organization

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For logarithmic conformal field theories whose monodromy data is given by a not necessarily semisimple modular category, we solve the problem of constructing and classifying the consistent systems of correlators. The correlator construction given in this article applies to the open-closed sector and generalizes the well-known one for rational conformal field theories given by Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert roughly twenty years ago and solves conjectures of Fuchs, Gannon, Schaumann and Schweigert. The strategy is, even in the rational special case, entirely different. The correlators are constructed using the extension procedures that can be devised by means of the modular microcosm principle. It is shown that, as in the rational case, the correlators admit a holographic description, with the main difference that the holographic principle is phrased in terms of factorization homology. The latter description is used to prove that the coefficients obtained by the evaluation of the torus partition function at projective objects are non-negative integers. Moreover, we show that the derived algebra of local operators associated to a consistent system of correlators carries a Batalin-Vilkovisky structure. We prove that it is equivalent to the Batalin-Vilkovisky structure on the Hochschild cohomology of the pivotal module category of boundary conditions, for the notion of pivotality due to Schaumann and Shimizu. This proves several expectations formulated by Kapustin-Rozansky and Fuchs-Schweigert for general conformal field theories.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10153v2'>2508.10153</a>\]&nbsp; **On $q$-analogs of the $3x+1$ Dynamical System**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-31 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kenneth G. Monks &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages, 2 tables

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer $x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$ for $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps $x\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In particular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$. This seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the conjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any correspondence between polynomials and positive integers. In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend their domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that correspond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power series. We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\colon F_2[[q]]\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$ otherwise, where $A,B\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some of these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive integers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that $T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the orbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two fixed points. Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these conjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by replacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic integer. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could settle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for both $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v3: Major revision of Sec. 3 to clarify the paper's scope. Sec. 3 now rigorously establishes the operator's domain of absolute convergence, while the discussion of a localized construction is removed. The global definition via analytic continuation is now framed as future work. Abstract and introduction have been revised accordingly

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper explicitly constructs the integral kernels for a family of weight-shifting operators mapping from the space of weight-k smooth automorphic functions to the space of weight-t automorphic functions. These operators are defined as integral transforms whose kernel, K, is the product of a covariant factor P and a G-invariant function F. The key assumption in the kernel's construction is the spectral condition that K is an eigenfunction of the weight-t hyperbolic Laplacian, Delta_t. This partial differential equation reduces to an ordinary differential equation for the invariant function F, which is shown to be equivalent to the Hypergeometric Differential Equation (HDE). The main result of this paper is the explicit determination of the HDE parameters (a,b,c) as functions of the automorphic data (k,t,q) and the spectral parameter lambda_K. As a foundational step toward the rigorous realization of the operator, we conclude with an analysis of the absolute convergence of the corresponding integral transform. This analysis establishes a region where the operator is well-defined and frames the problem of its global definition via analytic continuation, a task deferred to a subsequent investigation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a mock modular form $M_{\Delta}(\tau)$ that arises naturally from Ramanujan's Delta-function. It is a weight $-10$ harmonic Maass form whose nonholomorphic part is the "period integral function'' of $\Delta(\tau)$. The Hecke operator $T_{-10}(m)$ acts on this mock modular form in terms of Ramanujan's $\tau(m)$ and a monic degree $m$ polynomial $F_m(x),$ evaluated at $x=j(\tau).$ In analogy with results by Asai, Kaneko, and Ninomiya on the zeros of Hecke polynomials for the $j$-function, we prove that the zeros of each $F_m(x)$, including $x=0$ and $x=1728,$ are distinct and lie in $[0, 1728]$. Additionally, as $m \to +\infty,$ these zeros become equidistributed in $[0, 1728].$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a large prime number. We prove that any integer $\lambda$ modulo $p$ can be represented in the form $$ m!n! +\sum_{i=1}^{47}n_i!\equiv \lambda \pmod p, $$ with $\max\{m,n,n_1,\ldots,n_{47}\}\ll p^{1300/1301}.$ This improves the exponent $1350/1351$ of Garaev, Luca and Shparlinski (2005). Furthermore, we prove that any integer $\lambda$ can be represented in the form $$ m_1!n_1! +m_2!n_2!+m_3!n_3! +m_4!n_4!+m_5!n_5! \equiv \lambda \pmod p $$ with $\max\{m_1,n_1,\ldots,m_5,n_5\}\le p^{97/113 +o(1)}.$ This improves the exponent $27/28$ of Garaev and Garcia (2007). The proofs of these two results are based on the recent work of Grebennikov, Sagdeev, Semchankau and Vasilevskii (2024). We also obtain some lower bound estimates on the cardinality of the product set of two factorials modulo a prime. For instance, we prove that if $N<p^{3/5},$ then $$ \#\{m!n!\pmod p; \, 1\le m,n\le N\}\gg N^{1-o(1)}. $$ The proof of this result is based on works of Banks and Shparlinski (2020), Cilleruelo and Garaev (2016), and the work of Katz and Shen (2008) related to the Ruzsa-Pl\"unnecke inequality from additive combinatorics.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 31 pages, new section 9 deals with twin prime conjecture

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We posit that $d_n^2 < 2p_{n+1}$ holds for all $n\geq 1$, where $p_n$ represents the $n$th prime and $d_n$ stands for the $n$th prime gap i.e. $d_n := p_{n+1} - p_n$. Then, the presence of a prime between successive perfect squares, as well as the validity of $\Delta_n := \sqrt{p_{n+1}} - \sqrt{p_n} < 1$ are derived. Next, $\pi(x)$ being the number of primes $p$ up to $x$, we deduce $\pi(n^2-n) < \pi(n^2) < \pi(n^2+n)$ $(n\geq 2)$. In addition, a proof of $\pi((n+1)^k) - \pi(n^k) \geq \pi(2^k)$ \ $(k\geq 2, n\geq 1)$ is worked out. The vanishing nature of $\Delta_n$ as $n$ goes to infinity is set, and used afterwards to achieve both $\displaystyle{\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}d_n/\sqrt{p_n} = 0}$ and the twin prime conjecture. Also, question about the estimate $p_n < 2j_n^2 \ (n\geq 6)$, where $j_n$ counts the twin prime pairs up to $p_n$, is raised. Finally, we put forward the conjecture that any rational number $r$ $(0\leq r \leq 1)$ represents an accumulation point of the sequence $\left(\{\sqrt{p_n}\}\right)_{n\geq 1}$, where $\{x\}$ acts for the fractional part of $x$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Spectral sequences are a common tool to compute cohomology spaces, but higher structure is often lost on the way. In this article we exhibit a strategy to retain the higher structure on the cohomology, which works in case the chain complex with higher structure is presented as the twisting of a simpler chain complex by a Maurer-Cartan element. This works particularly well in case of the Hochschild complex of a minimal $ A_\infty $-category, where the Hochschild complex can be seen as the twisting of the Hochschild complex of the underlying associative algebra or category. As an application, we recover the existing formality result for Hochschild cohomology of wrapped Fukaya categories of punctured surfaces, and provide an $ L_\infty $-quasi-isomorphism between the Hochschild complex and its cohomology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We address two linked problems at the interface of quantum topology and number theory: deriving asymptotic expansions of the Witten--Reshetikhin--Turaev invariants for 3-manifolds and establishing quantum modularity of false theta functions. Previous progress covers Seifert homology 3-spheres for the former and rank-one cases for the latter, both of which rely on single-variable integral representations. We extend these results to negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds and to general false theta functions, respectively. We address this limitation by developing two techniques: a Poisson summation formula with signature and a framework of modular series, both of which enable a precise and explicit analysis of multivariable integral representations. As further applications, our method yields a unified approach to proving quantum modularity for false theta functions, indefinite theta functions, and for Eisenstein series of odd weight.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 57 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Katz-Sarnak density conjecture states that, as the analytic conductor $R \to \infty$, the distribution of the normalized low-lying zeros (those near the central point $s = 1/2$) converges to the scaling limits of eigenvalues clustered near 1 of subgroups of $U(N)$. There is extensive evidence supporting this conjecture for many families, including the family of holomorphic cusp newforms. Interestingly, there are very few choices for the main term of the limiting behavior. In 2009, S. J. Miller computed lower-order terms for the 1-level density of families of elliptic curve $L$-functions and compared to cuspidal newforms of prime level; while the main terms agreed, the lower order terms depended on the arithmetic of the family. We extend his work by identifying family-dependent lower-order correction terms in the weighted 1-level and 2-level densities of holomorphic cusp newforms up to $O\left(1/\log^4 R\right)$ error, sharpening Miller's $O\left(1/\log^3 R\right)$ error. We consider cases where the level is prime or when the level is a product of two, not necessarily distinct, primes. We show that the rates at which the prime factors of the level tend to infinity lead to different lower-order terms, breaking the universality of the main behavior.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Consider the level sets of the Markoff equation $$\mathrm{M}_k: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xyz - 2 = k.$$ The phenomenon of strong approximation, as named by Bourgain, Gamburd, and Sarnak, predicts that every solution of $\mathrm{M}_k$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$ descends from a solution over $\mathbb{Z}$. Moreover, we expect that the action of Vieta involutions (taking $(x, y, z)$ to $(yz-x, y, z)$, $(x, xz-y, z)$, and $(x, y, xy-z)$) on $\mathrm{M}_k(\mathbb{F}_p)$ is essentially transitive. In terms of matrices, Vieta involutions correspond to Nielsen moves in pairs $(A, B) \in \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p) \times \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ for which $\mathrm{tr}([A, B]) = k$. This correspondence is induced by $$\mathrm{Tr}: (A, B) \mapsto (\mathrm{tr}(A), \mathrm{tr}(B), \mathrm{tr}(AB)).$$ McCullough and Wanderley conjectured that Nielsen moves connect two pairs $(A_1, B_1)$, $(A_2, B_2)$ of generators of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ if and only if $[A_1, B_1]$ is conjugate to $[A_2, B_2]$ or $[B_2, A_2]$. Based on this, one expects that generating pairs $(A, B)$ of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ for which $\mathrm{tr}([A, B]) = k$ determine a single orbit of $\mathrm{M}_k(\mathbb{F}_p)$, and the remaining exceptional orbits come from non-generating pairs of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$. In this article, we describe the set of exceptional orbits of $\mathrm{M}_k(\mathbb{F}_p)$, showing that they agree with the finite orbits of the equation $\mathrm{M}_k$ over $\mathbb{C}$ found by Dubrovin and Mazzocco. Furthermore, we prove that the conjecture of McCullough and Wanderley is equivalent to strong approximation when $p \equiv 3 \mod{4}$. Lastly, we present the recent developments of Chen on the problem and use our classification of exceptional orbits to make a divisibility conjecture about the size of the largest orbit of $\mathrm{M}_k(\mathbb{F}_p)$.</p></details>

For example, $K$ may be a totally imaginary number field or a finite extension of a $p$-adic field.

In this paper, we first construct some modules for the BCCA and one of its subalgebras, which we call $\mathcal{O}$, by restriction of well-known modules of the BMS$_3$ and Witt algebras respectively. After showing that such modules are free or ``almost free'', we go through some structure theory on the BCCA to define a new basis and a decreasing filtration on the algebra which lets us construct BCCA-modules intrinsically.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ without complex multiplication, Lang and Trotter conjecture $$ \# \{ p<X \mid E \text{ has a supersingular reduction at } p \} \sim \frac{c\sqrt{X}}{\log X} $$ as $X \rightarrow \infty$, where $c>0$ is a constant depending only on $E$. Fourvy and Murty obtained an average estimation related to the Lang-Trotter conjecture, called the Lang-Trotter conjecture on average. We considered the Lang-Trotter conjecture for curves of genus 2, and obtained a similar result to the Lang-Trotter conjecture on average for the family of curves $C_{\lambda}:y^2=x(x-1)(x+1)(x-{\lambda})(x-1/ \lambda)$. Such curves are characterized as curves of genus two with reduced automorphism group containing the Klein $4$-group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime number and $\zeta_p$ a primitive $p$-th root of unity. Chebotarev's theorem states that every square submatrix of the $p \times p$ matrix $(\zeta_p^{ij})_{i,j=0}^{p-1}$ is non-singular. In this paper we prove the same for principal submatrices of $(\zeta_n^{ij})_{i,j=0}^{n-1}$, when $n=pr$ is the product of two distinct primes, and $p$ is a large enough prime that has order $r-1$ in $\mathbf{Z}_r^*$. As an application, an uncertainty principle for cyclic groups of order $n$ is established when $n=pr$ as described above.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A cluster algebra is an algebraic structure generated by operations of a quiver (a directed graph) called the mutations and their associated simple birational mappings. By using a graph-combinatorial approach, we present a systematic way to derive a tropical, i.e. subtraction-free birational, representation of Weyl groups from cluster algebras. Our results provide an extensive class of Weyl group actions, including previously known examples with algebro-geometric background, and hence are relevant to the q-Painleve equations and their higher-order extensions. Key ingredients of the argument are the combinatorial aspects of the reflection associated with a cycle subgraph in the quiver. We also study symplectic structures of the discrete dynamical systems thus obtained. The normal form of a skew-symmetric integer matrix allows us to choose Darboux coordinates while preserving the birationality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $n\geq 2$, let $\Gamma\subset \mathrm{SU}((n,1),\mathcal{O}_{K})$ be a torsion-free, finite-index subgroup, where $\mathcal{O}_K$ denotes the ring of integers of a totally imaginary number field $K$ of degree $2$. Let $\mathbb{B}^n$ denote the $n$-dimensional complex ball endowed with the hyperbolic metric, and let $X_{\Gamma}:=\Gamma\backslash \mathbb{B}^n$ denote the quotient space. Furthermore, let $\mu_{\mathrm{hyp}}^{\mathrm{vol}}$ denote the volume form associated to the hyperbolic metric. Let $\Lambda:=\Omega_{\overline{X}_{\Gamma}}^{n}$ denote the line bundle, where $\overline{X}_{\Gamma}:=X_{\Gamma}\cup\lbrace \infty\rbrace$. For any $k\geq 1$, let $\lambda^{k}:=\Lambda^{\otimes k}\otimes O_{\overline{X}_{\Gamma}}((k-1)\infty)$. For any $k\geq 1$, the hyperbolic metric induces a point-wise metric on $H^{0}(\overline{X}_{\Gamma},\lambda^{k})$. For any $k\geq 1$, let $\mathcal{B}_{X_{\Gamma}}^{\lambda^{k}}$ denote the Bergman kernel associated $H^{0}(\overline{X}_{\Gamma},\lambda^{k})$. Then, for $k\gg1$, the first main result of the article, is the following estimate $$ \sup_{z\in \overline{X}_{\Gamma}}\big|\mathcal{B}_{X_{\Gamma}}^{\lambda^{k}}(z,z)\big|_{\mathrm{hyp}}=O_{X_{\Gamma}}(k^{n+1/2}).$$ For any $k\geq 1$, and $z\in X_{\Gamma}$, let $\mu_{\mathrm{Ber},k}(z)$ denote the Bergman metric associated to the line bundle $\lambda^{ k}$, and let $\mu_{\mathrm{ber},k}^{\mathrm{vol}}$ denote the associated volume form. Then, for $k\gg1$, the second main result of the article is the following estimate $$ \sup_{z\in \overline{X}_{\Gamma}}\bigg|\frac{\mu_{\mathrm{Ber},k}^{\mathrm{vol}}(z)}{\mu_{\mathrm{hyp}}^{\mathrm{vol}}(z)}\bigg|=O_{X_{\Gamma}}\big(k^{2(n-1)(n+1)+n+3} \big).$$ Our estimate for the Bergman metric completes our arguments and corrects our estimate from arXiv:2305.11609, for $n=1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a fixed $z\in\mathbb{C}$ and a fixed $k\in\mathbb{N}$, let $\sigma_{z}^{(k)}(n)$ denote the sum of $z$-th powers of those divisors $d$ of $n$ whose $k$-th powers also divide $n$. This arithmetic function is a simultaneous generalization of the well-known divisor function $\sigma_z(n)$ as well as the divisor function $d^{(k)}(n)$ first studied by Wigert. The Dirichlet series of $\sigma_{z}^{(k)}(n)$ does not fall under the purview of Chandrasekharan and Narasimhan's fundamental work on Hecke's functional equation with multiple gamma factors. Nevertheless, as we show here, an explicit and elegant Vorono\"{\dotlessi} summation formula exists for this function. As its corollaries, some transformations of Wigert are generalized. The kernel $H_{z}^{(k)}(x)$ of the associated integral transform is a new generalization of the Bessel kernel. Several properties of this kernel such as its differential equation, asymptotic behavior and its special values are derived. A crucial relation between $H_{z}^{(k)}(x)$ and an associated integral $K_{z}^{(k)}(x)$ is obtained, the proof of which is deep, and employs the theory of linear differential equations and the properties of Stirling numbers of the second kind and elementary symmetric polynomials.</p></details>

As an intermediate result we give an explicit description of the Picard-Vessiot rings and of the Galois groups associated to the operators in the image of the Carlitz module, using techniques inspired by the Carlitz-Hayes theory.</p></details>

For $\ell = 2$, this was proved by Kable and Wright using the deep theory of prehomogeneous vector spaces.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod $n$ homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}.$ As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod $n$ homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected and area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Duke, Imamo\=glu, and T\'oth have recently constructed a new geometric invariant, a hyperbolic orbifold, associated to each narrow ideal class of a real quadratic field. Furthermore, they have shown that the projection of these hyperbolic orbifolds onto the modular surface $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}$ equidistributes on average over a genus of the narrow class group as the fundamental discriminant $D$ of the real quadratic field tends to infinity. We extend this construction of hyperbolic orbifolds to allow for a level structure, akin to Heegner points and closed geodesics of level $q$. Additionally, we refine this equidistribution result in several directions. First, we investigate sparse equidistribution in the level aspect, where we prove the equidistribution of level $q$ hyperbolic orbifolds when restricted to a translate of $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}$ in $\Gamma_0(q) \backslash \mathbb{H}$, which presents some new interesting features. Second, we explore sparse equidistribution in the subgroup aspect, namely equidistribution on average over small subgroups of the narrow class group. Third, we prove small scale equidistribution and give upper bounds for the discrepancy. Behind these refinements is a new interpretation of the Weyl sums arising in these equidistribution problems in terms of ad\`elic period integrals, which in turn are related to Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions via Waldspurger's formula. The key remaining inputs are hybrid subconvex bounds for these $L$-functions and a certain homological version of the sup-norm problem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A cryptarithm (or alphametic) is a mathematical puzzle in which numbers are represented with words in such a way that identical letters stand for equal digits and distinct letters for unequal digits. An alphametic puzzle is usually given in the form of an equation that needs to be solved, such as SEND + MORE = MONEY. Alternatively, here we will consider cryptarithms constrained not by an equation but by a particular subsequence of natural numbers, for example perfect squares or primes. Such a cryptarithm has a unique solution if there is exactly one term in the sequence that has the corresponding pattern of digits. We will call such terms cryptarithmically unique. Here we estimate the density of such terms in an arbitrary sequence for which the overall density of terms among integers is known. In particular, among all perfect squares below 10^12, slightly less than one half are cryptarithmically unique, their density increasing toward larger numbers. Cryptarithmically unique prime numbers, however, are initially very scarce. Combinatorial estimates suggest that their density should drop below 10^-300 for decimal lengths of approximately 1829 digits, but then it recovers and is asymptotic to unity for very large primes. Finally, we introduce and discuss primonumerophobic digit patterns that no prime number happens to have.</p></details>

This rather natural sequence is sequence A283190 in the OEIS and while some basic facts are known, it seems that surprisingly it has barely been studied. First, we prove that $s(n) = c \cdot n + O(n/(\log n \log \log n))$, where $c$ is an explicit constant. Then we focus on differences between consecutive terms $s(n)$ and $s(n+1)$. It turns out that the value can always increase by at most one, but there exist arbitrarily large decreases. We show that the differences are bounded by $O(\log \log n)$. Finally, we consider ''iterated remainder sets''. These are related to a problem arising from Pierce expansions, and we prove bounds for the size of these sets as well.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Suppose $\Gamma < \mathrm{PU}(n,1)$ is a cocompact arithmetic lattice of simplest type with profinite completion $\widehat{\Gamma}$. This paper proves there is an open subgroup $\widehat{\Gamma}_0 \le \widehat{\Gamma}$ such that $H^j(\widehat{\Delta}, \mathbb{F}_p)$ is nontrivial for every open subgroup ${\widehat{\Delta} \le \widehat{\Gamma}_0}$, $j \le 2n$, and sufficiently large prime $p$. If $n \ge 2$, nonvanishing is new for all $j \ge 2$. Consequently, the virtual cohomological dimension of $\widehat{\Gamma}$ is at least $2n$, improving the previous lower bound of $1$. The proof shows there is a profinite fundamental class for the associated ball quotient and that its canonical class is profinite modulo torsion. For congruence $\Gamma$ and $j < \frac{n+1}{2}$, restriction ${H^j(\widehat{\Gamma}, \mathbb{F}_p) \to H^j(\Gamma, \mathbb{F}_p)}$ is shown to be almost surjective in a precise sense; this is related to whether lattices in $\mathrm{PU}(n,1)$ are good in the sense of Serre, which is only known to hold for $n=1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a Dirichlet series $L(s) = \sum a_n n^{-s}$, the asymptotic growth rate of $\sum_{n\le X} a_n$ can be determined by a Tauberian theorem. Bounds on the error term are typically controlled by the size of $|L(\sigma+it)|$ for fixed real part $\sigma$. We modify this approach to prove new Tauberian theorems with error terms depending only on the average size of $L(\sigma+it)$ as $t$ varies, and we take care to track explicit dependence on various parameters. This often leads to stronger error bounds, and introduces strong connections between asymptotic counting problems and moments of $L$-functions. We provide self-contained statements of Tauberian theorems in anticipation that these results can be used ``out of the box'' to prove new asymptotic expansions.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1908, Voronoi introduced an algorithm that solves the lattice packing problem in any dimension in finite time. Voronoi showed that any lattice with optimal packing density must be a so-called perfect lattice, and his algorithm enumerates the finitely many perfect lattices up to similarity in a fixed dimension. However, due to the high complexity of the algorithm this enumeration had, until now, only been completed up to dimension 8. In this work we compute all 2237251040 perfect lattices in dimension 9 via Voronoi's algorithm. As a corollary, this shows that the laminated lattice $\Lambda_9$ gives the densest lattice packing in dimension 9. Equivalently, we show that the Hermite constant $\gamma_9$ in dimension 9 equals $2$. Furthermore, we extend a result by Watson (1971) and show that the set of possible kissing numbers in dimension 9 is precisely $2 \cdot \{ 1, \ldots, 91, 99, 120, \ldots, 129, 136 \}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a homogeneous space $X$ over a number field $k$, the Brauer-Manin obstruction has been used to study strong approximation for $X$ away from a finite set $S$ of places, and known results state that $X(k)$ is dense in the omitting-$S$ projection of the Brauer-Manin set $\mathrm{pr}_S(X(\mathbb{A}_k)^{\mathrm{br}})$, under certain assumptions. In order to completely understand the closure of $X(k)$ in the set of $S$-adelic points $X(\mathbb{A}_k^S)$, we ask: (i) whether $\mathrm{pr}_S(X(\mathbb{A}_k)^{\mathrm{br}})$ is closed in $X(\mathbb{A}_k^S)$; (ii) whether $X(k)$ is dense in the closed subset of $X(\mathbb{A}_k^S)$ cut out by elements in $\mathrm{br}X$ which induce zero evaluation maps at all the places in $S$. We also ask these questions considering only the algebraic Brauer group. We give answers to such questions for homogeneous spaces $X$ under semisimple simply connected groups with commutative stabilizers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we introduce the definition of equal-difference cyclotomic coset, and prove that in general any cyclotomic coset can be decomposed into a disjoint union of equal-difference subsets. Among the equal-difference decompositions of a cyclotomic coset, an important class consists of those in the form of cyclotomic decompositions, called the multiple equal-difference representations of the coset. There is an equivalent correspondence between the multiple equal-difference representations of $q$-cyclotomic cosets modulo $n$ and the irreducible factorizations of $X^{n}-1$ in binomial form over finite extension fields of $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. We give an explicit characterization of the multiple equal-difference representations of any $q$-cyclotomic coset modulo $n$, through which a criterion for $X^{n}-1$ factoring into irreducible binomials is obtained. In addition, we present an algorithm to simplify the computation of the leaders of cyclotomic cosets.</p></details>

We establish new infinite families of Ramanujan-type congruences, divisibility results, and positive-density prime sets for which $c_{k, r_1, r_2}(n)$ vanishes modulo a given prime.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a linear--independence principle for finite families of translates in irreducible, square--integrable modulo the center (SI/Z) representations of step--two nilpotent Lie groups with one--dimensional center. Fix a one--parameter subgroup $\exp(\mathbb R X)$ and a noncentral element $Y$ (not assumed to commute with $X$). For every nonzero smooth vector $f$, any finite collection $\{\pi(\exp(x_k X))f\}_{k=1}^m$ (with distinct parameters $x_k$) of translates along $\exp(\mathbb R X)$, together with the single translate $\pi(\exp Y)f$, is linearly independent. The proof combines Schwartz regularity of matrix coefficients in the noncentral variables with an ergodic log--product estimate on a compact torus generated by commutator phases. As a result, we obtain an HRT--type statement for $(m,1)$ configurations (on--line direction with zero $X_{k_0}$--component and rogue $\exp X_{k_0}$) for all nonzero Schwartz windows, without spacing restrictions.</p></details>

Specifically, among other things, I shall show that $$ \forall n \geq 4, \qquad\forall x \geq \exp(\exp(33)), \qquad \hbox{there are primes in the interval} \left[x, x+ x^{1-{1\over n}}\right]; $$ $$ \forall n \geq 91, \qquad\forall x \geq [90^{90}]^{n/(n-90)} , \qquad \hbox{there are primes in the interval} \left[x, x+ x^{1-{1\over n}}\right]. $$ Furthermore $$ \forall n \geq 106, \qquad\forall x \geq 1, \qquad \hbox{there are primes in the interval} \left[x, x+ x^{1-{1\over n}}\right]. $$ In particular this last observation makes both the Hoheisel and Heilbronn results fully explicit and effective.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Arborified multiple zeta values are a generalization of multiple zeta values associated with rooted trees. There are two types of decorated rooted trees, corresponding respectively to the series and the integral expressions. Manchon introduces the contracting arborification (resp. the simple arborification), which is maps from the BCK Hopf algebras of the decorated rooted trees corresponding to the series expression (resp. the integral expression) to the non-commutative polynomial algebras of the set $\mathbb{N}$ (resp. the set $\{0,1\}$). There is a natural map between the two non-commutative polynomial algebras. Manchon posed the question of finding a natural map between the two BCK Hopf algebras that would make the diagram commutative. In this paper, we consider planar rooted trees and use a recursive method to construct such a map between the two BCK Hopf algebras, making the diagram commutative.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A well-known and fundamental property of the Macdonald polynomials $P_\lambda(x;q,t)$ is their invariance under the transformation sending $(q,t)$ to $(q^{-1},t^{-1})$. Recently, Concha and Lapointe showed that this property extends in an interesting, nontrivial way to an identity for partially symmetric Macdonald polynomials. Their identity played a key role in the work of Bechtloff Weising and Orr linking partially symmetric Macdonald polynomials to parabolic flag Hilbert schemes. In this paper, we refine the Concha-Lapointe identity to a sub-family of Alexandersson's permuted basement Macdonald polynomials and give a combinatorial proof of the refined identity. We show also that the Concha-Lapointe identity is equivalent to the assertion that (normalized) partially symmetric Macdonald polynomials are fixed under the Kazhdan-Lusztig involution.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages, latex; new section 4 of rigidity of braided non-semisimple r-categories added in v2

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a field, and let $\mathcal{C}$ be a Cauchy complete $k$-linear braided category with finite dimensional morphism spaces and ${{\rm End}(\bf 1)}=k$. We call an indecomposable object $X$ of $\mathcal C$ non-negligible if there exists $Y\in \mathcal{C}$ such that $\bf 1$ is a direct summand of $Y\otimes X$. We prove that every non-negligible object $X\in \mathcal{C}$ such that ${\rm dim}{\rm End}(X^{\otimes n})<n!$ for some $n$ is automatically rigid. In particular, if $\mathcal{C}$ is semisimple of moderate growth and weakly rigid, then $\mathcal{C}$ is rigid. As applications, we simplify Huang's proof of rigidity of representation categories of certain vertex operator algebras, and we get that for a finite semisimple monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$, the data of a $\mathcal{C}$-modular functor is equivalent to a modular fusion category structure on $\mathcal{C}$, answering a question of Bakalov and Kirillov. Finally, we show that if $\mathcal{C}$ is rigid and has moderate growth, then the quantum trace of any nilpotent endomorphism in $\mathcal{C}$ is zero. Hence $\mathcal{C}$ admits a semisimplification, which is a semisimple braided tensor category of moderate growth. Finally, we discuss rigidity in braided r-categories which are not semisimple, which arise in logarithmic conformal field theory. These results allow us to simplify a number of arguments of Kazhdan and Lusztig.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The $\frak{sl}_2$ KZ differential equations with values in the tensor power of the fundamental representation with parameter $\kappa=\pm 2$ are considered. A Satake-type correspondence is established over complex numbers and subsequently reduced to finite characteristic. This correspondence enables the study of the KZ equations on the lower weight subspaces of the tensor power in terms of the wedge powers of the weight subspace of the weight just below the highest weight. We apply this approach to analyze the $p$-curvature operators associated with our KZ equations, evaluate the dimension of the solution space in characteristic $p$, and determine whether all solutions are generated by the so-called $p$-hypergeometric solutions. In particular, we show that not all solutions of the KZ equations with $\kappa=2$ in characteristic $p$ are generated by $p$-hypergeometric solutions.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, we showed that for every irrational number $\alpha$, there exist infinitely many positive integers $n$ represented by any given positive definite binary quadratic form $Q$, satisfying $||\alpha n||<n^{-(1/2-\varepsilon)}$ for any fixed but arbitrarily small $\varepsilon>0$. We also provided a quantitative version with a lower bound when the exponent $1/2-\varepsilon$ is replaced by weaker exponent $\gamma<3/7-\varepsilon$. In this article we recover this quantitative version with the exponent $1/2-\varepsilon$, but now for the particular case of sums of two squares.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The braid variety of a positive braid and the augmentation variety of a Legendrian link both admit decompositions coming from weaves and rulings, respectively. We prove that these decompositions agree under an isomorphism between the braid variety and the augmentation variety. We also prove that both decompositions coincide with a Deodhar decomposition and another decomposition coming from the microlocal theory of sheaves. Our proof relies on a detailed comparison between weaves and Morse complex sequences. Among other things, we show that the cluster variables of the maximal cluster torus of the augmentation variety can be computed from the Legendrian via Morse complex sequences.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and analyze the ordered Zeckendorf game, a novel combinatorial two-player game inspired by Zeckendorf's Theorem, which guarantees a unique decomposition of every positive integer as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Building on the original Zeckendorf game\ -- previously studied in the context of unordered multisets\ -- we impose a new constraint: all moves must respect the order of summands. The result is a richer and more nuanced strategic landscape that significantly alters game dynamics. Unlike the classical version, where Player 2 has a dominant strategy for all $n > 2$, our ordered variant reveals a more balanced and unpredictable structure. In particular, we find that Player 1 wins for nearly all values $n \leq 25$, with a single exception at $n = 18$. This shift in strategic outcomes is driven by our game's key features: adjacency constraints that limit allowable merges and splits to neighboring terms, and the introduction of a switching move that reorders pairs. We prove that the game always terminates in the Zeckendorf decomposition\ -- now in ascending order\ -- by constructing a strictly decreasing monovariant. We further establish bounds on game complexity: the shortest possible game has length exactly $n - Z(n)$, where $Z(n)$ is the number of summands in the Zeckendorf decomposition of $n$, while the longest game exhibits quadratic growth, with $M(n) \sim \frac{n^2}{2}$ as $n \to \infty$. Empirical simulations suggest that random game trajectories exhibit log-normal convergence in their move distributions. Overall, the ordered Zeckendorf game enriches the landscape of number-theoretic games, posing new algorithmic challenges and offering fertile ground for future exploration into strategic complexity, probabilistic behavior, and generalizations to other recurrence relations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish an effective Bertini-type theorem for hypersurfaces $X_f \colon f = 0$ defined over a finite field $k$ for which $f$ has no linear factors over the algebraic closure $\overline{k}$. Given a line $L$ defined over $k$ and a nonreduced $\overline{k}$-point $x$ on $X_f \cap L$, we give an upper bound on the number of planes $P$ containing $L$ for which $X_f \cap P$ contains a line through $x$. Underlying this result is a factorization algorithm for bivariate polynomials originally due to Kaltofen, which we present with slightly relaxed hypotheses. Our primary application is to Artin's conjecture on $p$-adic forms of degree 7: if $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is a finite extension with residue field isomorphic to $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $F(x_0, \ldots, x_n) \in K[x_0, \ldots, x_{49}]$ is a homogeneous form of degree 7, then there exists a $K$-solution to $F=0$ whenever $q>679$. This improves on a result of Wooley.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A hyperbinary partition of the nonnegative integer n is a partition where every part is a power of 2 and every part appears at most twice. We give three applications of the length generating function for such partitions, denoted by h_q(n). Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko defined the q-analogue of a rational number [r/s]_q in various ways, most of which depend directly or indirectly on the continued fraction expansion of r/s. As our first application we show that [r/s]_q = q h_q(n-1)/h_q(n) where r/s occurs as the nth entry in the Calkin-Wilf enumeration of the non-negative rationals. Next we consider fence posets which are those which can be obtained from a sequence of chains by alternately pasting together maxima and minima. For every n we show there is a fence poset F(n) whose lattice of order ideals is isomorphic to the poset of hyperbinary partitions of n ordered by refinement. For our last application, Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko also showed that [r/s]_q can be computed by taking products of certain matrices which are q-analogues of the standard generators for the special linear group SL(2,R). We express the entries of these products in terms of the polynomials h_q(n).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The author gives nontrivial upper and lower bounds for the number of primes in the interval $[x - x^{\theta}, x]$ for some $0.52 \leqslant \theta < 0.525$, showing that the interval $[x - x^{0.52}, x]$ contains prime numbers for all sufficiently large $x$. This refines a result of Baker, Harman and Pintz (2001) and gives an affirmative answer to Harman and Pintz's argument. New arithmetical information, a delicate sieve decomposition, various techniques in Harman's sieve and accurate estimates for integrals are used to good effect.</p></details>
