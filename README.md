 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sabin Cautis &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>To a quiver we associate a finite length monoidal abelian category which categorifies the corresponding preprojective K-theoretic Hall algebra of Varagnolo-Vasserot. The simples in this category provide a (dual) canonical basis of the Hall algebra. In particular, if the quiver is affine, this provides a basis for the positive half of the corresponding quantum toroidal algebra. We also show that this abelian category is naturally endowed with renormalized r-matrices.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Rohit Nagpal, Andrew Snowden, Teresa Yu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AC &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cohen proved that the infinite variable polynomial ring $R=k[x_1,x_2,\ldots]$ is noetherian with respect to the action of the infinite symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}$. The first two authors began a program to understand the $\mathfrak{S}$-equivariant algebra of $R$ in detail. In previous work, they classified the $\mathfrak{S}$-prime ideals of $R$. An important example of an $\mathfrak{S}$-prime is the ideal $\mathfrak{h}_s$ generated by $(s+1)$st powers of the variables. In this paper, we study the category of $R/\mathfrak{h}_s$-modules. We obtain a number of results, and mention just three here: (a) we determine the Grothendieck group of the category; (b) we show that the Krull--Gabriel dimension is $s$; and (c) we obtain generators for the derived category. This paper will play a key role in subsequent work where we study general modules.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 22 pages, 1 table, comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The aim of this article is to discuss the derived equivalence problem for a local model of the simple flop of type $D_4$, which was found by Kanemitsu. First, tilting bundles on both sides of the flop are constructed, and then those tilting bundles are applied to prove the derived equivalence. This derived equivalence for the flop deduces derived equivalences between general K3 surfaces of degree $12$. The study of this example of a flop is very similar to the author's previous work for the simple of flop of type $G_2^{\dagger}$, but the construction and the analysis of tilting bundles become harder.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb V$ be an $\mathbb N$-graded $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra (VOA), not necessarily rational or self-dual. Using a special case of the sewing-factorization theorem from [GZ25a], we show that the end $\mathbb E=\int_{\mathbb M\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)}\mathbb M\otimes_{\mathbb C}\mathbb M'$ in $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes2})$ (where $\mathbb{M}'$ is the contragredient module of $\mathbb{M}$) admits a natural structure of associative $\mathbb C$-algebra compatible with its $\mathbb{V}^{\otimes2}$-module structure. Moreover, we show that a suitable category $\mathrm{Coh}_{\mathrm{L}}(\mathbb E)$ of left $\mathbb E$-modules is isomorphic, as a linear category, to $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)$, and that the space of vacuum torus conformal blocks is isomorphic to the space $\mathrm{SLF}(\mathbb E)$ of symmetric linear functionals on $\mathbb E$. Combining these results with the main theorem of [GZ25b], we prove a conjecture of Gainutdinov-Runkel: For any projective generator $\mathbb G$ in $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)$, the pseudo-$q$-trace construction yields a linear isomorphism from $\mathrm{SLF}(\mathrm{End}_{\mathbb V}(\mathbb{G})^{\mathrm{opp}})$ to the space of vacuum torus conformal blocks of $\mathbb V$. In particular, if $A$ is a unital finite-dimensional $\mathbb C$-algebra such that the category of finite-dimensional left $A$-modules is equivalent to $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)$, then $\mathrm{SLF}(A)$ is linearly isomorphic to the space of vacuum torus conformal blocks of $\mathbb V$. This confirms a conjecture of Arike-Nagatomo.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, using quaternion arithmetic in the ring of Lipschitz integers, we present a proof of Zh\`i-W\v{e}i S\={u}n's "1-3-5 conjecture" for integral solutions, and for all natural numbers greater than a specific constant. This, together with computations done by the authors and a colleague, which checked the validity of the conjecture up to that constant, completely proves the 1-3-5 conjecture. We also establish some variations of this conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Coorbit spaces provide a rigorous framework for the assessment of the approximation theoretic properties of generalized wavelet systems. It is therefore useful to understand when two different wavelet systems give rise to the same scales of coorbit spaces. This paper provides an exhaustive answer to this question for the case of continuous wavelet transforms associated with matrix groups in dimension two.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Stephen D. Cohen &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\F$ be the finite field of odd prime power order $q$, We find explicit expressions for the number of triples $\{\al-1,\al,\al+1 \}$ of consecutive non-zero squares in $\F$ and similarly for the number of triples of consecutive non-square elements. A key ingredient is the evaluation of Jacobsthal sums over general finite fields by Katre and Rajwade. This extends results of Monzingo(1985) to non-prime fields. Curiously, the same machinery alows the evaluation of the number of consecutive quadruples $\{\al -1, \al,\al+1, \al +2\}$ of square and non-squares over $\F$, when $q$ is a power of 5.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Eden Granot &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study points of moderately low degree on a curve $C$ over a number field, which is embedded on a nice toric surface $S$. Recently, Smith and Vogt related the linear equivalence classes of such points to intersections of $C$ with curves in the ambient surface. We show that when $C$ is sufficiently effective and ample with simple singularities, all but finitely many sufficiently low degree points are obtained via intersections of $C$ with curves in the ambient surface $S$. Our methods make use of the toric geometry of the ambient surface $S$ to produce curves which interpolate the low degree points on $C$. Furthermore, we generalise a result by Debarre and Klassen to singular plane curves and higher degrees of points.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is well-known that ADE Dynkin diagrams classify both the simply-laced simple Lie algebras and simple singularities. We introduce a polygonal wheel in a plane for each case of ADE, called the Coxeter wheel. We show that equivalence classes of edges and spokes of a Coxeter wheel form a geometric root system isomorphic to the classical root system of the corresponding type. This wheel is in fact derived from the Milnor fiber of corresponding simple singularities of two variables, and the bilinear form on the geometric root system is the negative of its symmetrized Seifert form. Furthermore, we give a completely geometric definition of simple Lie algebras using arcs, Seifert form and variation operator of the singularity theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A new sums-of-tails identity involving two parameters $b$ and $d$ is obtained and is used to derive more results of similar type. One of Ramanujan's sums-of-tails identities from the Lost Notebook is shown to be a special case of our result. In the course of deriving Ramanujan's identity, we obtain a new result of combinatorial significance. Two new representations for an infinite series associated to a mock theta function are derived. Also, we give an application of an identity of Andrews and Onofri.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 29 pages, submitted for publication. Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the generating function of the excess number of Rogers-Ramanujan partitions with odd rank over those with even rank, and, using combinatorial and analytical techniques, show that this generating function is closely connected with an interesting class of restricted partitions, namely, partitions into distinct parts where the number of parts is not a part. We derive arithmetic properties of the number of such partitions and conjecture an interesting mod $4$ congruence. Generalizations of most of these results in a parameter $\ell$ are also obtained.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 10 pages, no figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Specification is an important concept in dynamical systems introduced by Bowen. Schmeling proved that the set of $\beta>1$ such that the corresponding $\beta$-shift has specification is of Hausdorff dimension $1$. Hu et al. proved that the set of $\beta>1$ such that the corresponding $(-\beta)$-shift has specification is of Hausdorff dimension $1$. We show that the set of $(\alpha,\beta)\in[0,1)\times(1,\infty)$ such that the corresponding $(\alpha,\beta)$-shift has specification is of Hausdorff dimension $2$. A new difficulty is a simultaneous control of two critical symbol sequences that determine the ambient shift space. We achieve this by taking intersections of two thick Cantor sets in parameter space.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 51 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite central extension $\tilde{G}$ of a classical $p$-adic reductive group, we consider the endomorphism algebra of some induced projective generator \`a la Bernstein of the category of smooth representations of $\tilde{G}$. In the case where the Levi subgroups decompose, we can compute this algebra to get a result similar to the one previously obtained by the first author for classical $p$-adic groups, showing that this intertwining algebra is a twisted semi-direct product of an affine Hecke algebra with parameters by a twisted finite group algebra. We discuss also the general case. We give then an application to the category of genuine representations of a $p$-adic metaplectic group. Using results of C. M\oe glin relative to the Howe correspondence, we show that the Bernstein components of these groups are equivalent to tensor products of categories of unipotent representations of classical groups. This generalizes a previous result of the first author. It implies an equivalence of categories between the category of genuine representations of the $p$-adic metaplectic group and the direct sums of those of smooth representations of the corresponding odd special orthogonal group and its pure inner form.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. Let $R$ be a finite dimensional commutative local $k$-algebra and let $Q$ be a quiver with no oriented cycles. In this paper, we study (signed) $\tau$-exceptional sequences over the algebra $\Lambda = R\otimes kQ$, which is isomorphic to $RQ$. We show there is a bijection between the set of complete (signed) $\tau$-exceptional sequences in $\text{mod }kQ$ and the set of complete (signed) $\tau$-exceptional sequences in $\text{mod }\Lambda$. Moreover, we prove that every $\tau$-perpendicular subcategory of $\text{mod }\Lambda$ is equivalent to the module category of $R\otimes kQ'$, for some quiver $Q'$. As a consequence, we prove that the $\tau$-cluster morphism categories of $kQ$ and $\Lambda$ are equivalent.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper classifies complex homogeneous $2$-local representations of the multiple virtual braid group $M_kVB_n$ into $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ for $n\geq3$ and $k >1$, showing that such representations fall into exactly $2^{k+1}+1$ distinct types, out of which except three all are unfaithful. In addition, this paper investigates complex homogeneous $2$-local representations of the multiple welded braid group $M_kWB_n$ into $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ for $n\geq3$ and $k >1$, identifying $3 \cdot 2^{k-1} +1$ representations. Moreover, the article includes a construction of a non-local representation of $M_2WB_3$ that extends the known LKB representation of the braid group on $3$ strands, namely $B_3$, making a path towards constructing non-local representations of $M_kWB_n$ in general.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by the construction of Newton--Okounkov bodies and toric degenerations via cluster algebras in [GHKK18, FO25], we consider a family of Newton--Okounkov polytopes of a complex smooth Fano variety $X$ related by a composition of tropicalized cluster mutations. According to the work of [HK15], the toric degeneration associated with each Newton--Okounkov polytope $\Delta$ in the family produces a completely integrable system of $X$ over $\Delta$. We investigate circumstances in which each completely integrable system possesses a monotone Lagrangian torus fiber. We provide a sufficient condition, based on the data of tropical integer points and exchange matrices, for the family of constructed monotone Lagrangian tori to contain infinitely many monotone Lagrangian tori, no two of which are related by any symplectomorphism. By employing this criterion and exploiting the correspondence between the tropical integer points and the dual canonical basis elements, we generate infinitely many distinct monotone Lagrangian tori on flag manifolds of arbitrary type except in a few cases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate races among prime ideals in number fields when there are two or more competing conjugacy classes. In their work [4], Fiorilli and Jouve studied two-way races in number fields and showed that-unlike the classical setting of primes in arithmetic progressions-these biases can approach the extreme values of 0 and 1. They also identified when these biases tend toward one-half (as the degree of the extension grows), which we call ''moderate biases'' because that behavior mirrors the classical case. In this paper, we extend their analysis to races with r competing conjugacy classes (rway races) and precisely study the cases where these biases are moderate (meaning they tend to 1/r! as the discriminant of the extension grows). Our first main result is an explicit formula for the bias in any r-way race (for all r $\ge$ 2), generalizing the two-way formula of Fiorilli and Jouve [4] and Lamzouri's r-way expression in the classical case of residue classes modulo q [12], under the same hypotheses. Using this formula, we give a criterion characterizing completely, in the abelian case, r-moderate races. Surprisingly, once r $\ge$ 3 this criterion is independent of r, making the two-way race exceptional. We also construct families of number fields exhibiting such moderacy, we prove density results for the values of logarithmic densities and exhibit different behaviors of those densities between the cases r = 3 and r $\ge$ 4. and showed that its magnitude governs the bias: 2 ) converges to the extreme values 1 or 0. $\bullet$ Moderate bias. Under additional hypotheses (automatically satisfied in the abelian case), if L/K (C 1 , C 2 ) $\rightarrow$ 1/2, mirroring the classical prime-ideal race studied by Rubinstein-Sarnak and Fiorilli-Martin. Applying this criterion to several explicit families such that the degree grows to $\infty$, Fiorilli and Jouve produced examples of both moderate and extreme biases along families of number fields. In the same spirit, Bailleul [1] investigated dihedral and quaternion extensions, uncovering further families in which the densities not only approach the value 1/2 but can again be made to lie arbitrarily near the extremes, while also highlighting the influence of central zeros of Artin L-functions on the behavior of those densities.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A cluster algebra is an algebraic structure generated by operations of a quiver (a directed graph) called the mutations and their associated simple birational mappings. By using a graph-combinatorial approach, we present a systematic way to derive a tropical, i.e. subtraction-free birational, representation of Weyl groups from cluster algebras. Our results provide an extensive class of Weyl group actions, including previously known examples with algebro-geometric background, and hence are relevant to the q-Painleve equations and their higher-order extensions. Key ingredients of the argument are the combinatorial aspects of the reflection associated with a cycle subgraph in the quiver. We also study symplectic structures of the discrete dynamical systems thus obtained. The normal form of a skew-symmetric integer matrix allows us to choose Darboux coordinates while preserving the birationality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider subsets of linearly independent roots in a certain root system $\varPhi$. Let $S'$ be such a subset, and let $S'$ be associated with any Carter diagram $\Gamma'$. The main question of the paper: what root $\gamma \in \varPhi$ can be added to $S'$ so that $S' \cup \gamma$ is also a subset of linearly independent roots? This extra root $\gamma$ is called the linkage root. The vector $\gamma^{\nabla}$ of inner products $\{(\gamma,\tau'_i)\mid \tau'_i \in S'\}$ is called the linkage label vector. Let $B_{\Gamma'}$ be the Cartan matrix associated with $\Gamma'$. It is shown that $\gamma$ is a linkage root if and only if $\mathscr{B}^{\vee}_{\Gamma'}(\gamma^{\nabla}) < 2$, where $\mathscr{B}^{\vee}_{\Gamma'}$ is a quadratic form with the matrix inverse to $B_{\Gamma'}$. The set of all linkage roots for $\Gamma'$ is called a linkage system and is denoted by $\mathscr{L}(\Gamma')$. The Cartan matrix associated with any Carter diagram $\Gamma'$ is conjugate to the Cartan matrix associated with some Dynkin diagram $\Gamma$, [St23]. The sizes of $\mathscr{L}(\Gamma')$ and $\mathscr{L}(\Gamma)$ are the same. Let $W^{\vee}$ be the Weyl group of the quadratic form $\mathscr{B}^{\vee}_{\Gamma'}$. This group acts on the linkage system and forms several orbits. The sizes and structure of orbits for linkage systems $\mathscr{L}(D_l)$ and $\mathscr{L}(D_l(a_k))$ are presented.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 33 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a novel approach to study hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras, and more specifically, the Feingold-Frenkel algebra $\mathfrak{F}$, which is based on considering the tensor algebra of level-one states before descending to the Lie algebra by converting tensor products into multiple commutators. This method enables us to exploit the presence of mutually commuting coset Virasoro algebras, whose number grows without bound with increasing affine level. We present the complete decomposition of the tensor algebra under the affine and coset Virasoro symmetries for all levels $\ell\leq 5$, as well as the maximal tensor ground states from which all elements of $\mathfrak{F}$ up to level five can be (redundantly) generated by the joint action of the affine and coset Virasoro generators, and subsequent conversion to multi-commutators, which are then expressed in terms of transversal and longitudinal DDF states. We outline novel directions for future work.</p></details>

The set of forbidden differences, $X$, is called \textit{intersective} if $D(X,N)=o(N)$, with the most well-studied examples being $X=S=\{n^2: n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ and $X=\mathcal{P}-1=\{p-1: p\text{ prime}\}$. In addition to some new results, including exact formulas and estimates for $D(X,N)$ in some non-intersective cases like $X=\mathcal{P}$ and $X=S+k$, $k\in \mathbb{N}$, we also provide a comprehensive survey of known bounds and extensive computational data. In particular, we utilize an existing algorithm for finding maximum cliques in graphs to determine $D(S,N)$ for $N\leq 300$ and $D(\mathcal{P}-1,N)$ for $N\leq 500$. None of these exact values appear previously in the literature.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Famously, Kohel proved that isogeny graphs of ordinary elliptic curves are beautifully structured objects, now called volcanos. We prove graph structural theorems for abelian varieties of any dimension with commutative endomorphism ring and containing a fixed locally Bass order, leveraging an ideal-theoretic perspective on isogeny graphs. This generalizes previous results, which relied on restrictive additional assumptions, such as maximal real multiplication, ordinary, and absolutely simple (Brooks, Jetchev, Wesolowski 2017). In particular, our work also applies to non-simple and non-ordinary isogeny classes. To obtain our results, we first prove a structure theorem for the lattice of inclusion of the overorders of a locally Bass order in an \'etale algebra which is of independent interest. This analysis builds on a careful study of local singularities of the orders. We include several examples of volcanoes and isogeny graphs exhibiting unexpected properties ultimately due to our more general setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The mass transference principle of Beresnevich and Velani is a powerful mechanism for determining the Hausdorff dimension/measure of $\limsup$ sets that arise naturally in Diophantine approximation. However, in the setting of dynamical Diophantine approximation, this principle often fails to apply effectively, as the radii of the balls defining the dynamical $\limsup$ sets generally depend on the orbit of the point $x$ itself. In this paper, we develop a dimensional mass transference principle that enables us to recover and extend classical results on shrinking target problems, particularly for the $\beta$-transformation and the Gauss map. Moreover, our result shows that the corresponding $\limsup$ sets have large intersection properties. A potentially interesting feature of our method is that, in many cases, shrinking target problems are closely related to finding an appropriate Gibbs measure, which may reveal new aspects of the link between thermodynamic formalism and dynamical Diophantine approximation.</p></details>

Moreover, the strict derived Hecke algebra possesses a rational form that preserves the canonical rational structure on the stable cohomology during the derived Hecke action.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The authors define a Category $\mathcal{O}$ for any quasi-reductive Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with respect to a triangular decomposition. This much needed approach unifies many important constructions in the existing literature in a rigorous fashion. Our Category $\mathcal{O}$ encompasses all highest weight categories for Lie (super)algebras as well as specific examples which may not be highest weight categories. When the decomposition arises from a principal parabolic subalgebra $\mathfrak{p}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$, the Category $\mathcal{O}$ exhibits rich homological properties. For one, the authors show that in contrast to the case of a semisimple Lie algebra, the Category $\mathcal{O}$ is standardly stratified. Moreover, the categorical cohomology of $\mathcal{O}$ is a finitely generated ring. This provides a first step towards developing a support variety theory for Category $\mathcal{O}$. Finally, it is shown that the complexity of modules in Category $\mathcal{O}$ is finite with an explicit upper bound given by the dimension of the subspace of the odd degree elements in $\mathfrak{g}$. This upgrades results known for $\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$ to the more general setting. Our arguments are based on foundational connections between the categorical cohomology and the relative Lie superalgebra cohomology as well as the interplay between Category $\mathcal{O}$ for $\mathfrak{g}$ and the Category $\mathcal{O}$ for its corresponding Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_{\bar 0}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The general linear group $GL_{n}$, along with its adjoint simple group $PGL_n$, can be described by means of weighted planar networks. In this paper we give a network description for simple Lie groups of types $B$ and $C$. The corresponding networks are axially symmetric modulo a sequence of cluster mutations along the axis of symmetry. We extend to this setting the result of Gekhtman, Shapiro, and Vainshtein on the Poisson property of Postnikov's boundary measurement map. We also show that $B$ and $C$ type networks with positive weights parametrize the totally nonnegative part of the respective group. Finally, we construct network parametrizations of double Bruhat cells in symplectic and odd-dimensional orthogonal groups, and identify the corresponding face weights with Fock-Goncharov cluster coordinates.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose new vertex operators, both the type I and the type II dual, of the elliptic quantum toroidal algebra U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}) by combining representations of U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}) and the notions of the elliptic stable envelopes for the instanton moduli space M(n,r). The vertex operators reproduce the shuffle product formula of the elliptic stable envelopes by their composition. We also show that the vacuum expectation value of a composition of the vertex operators gives a correct formula of the K-theoretic vertex function for M(n,r). We then derive exchange relations among the vertex operators and construct a L-operator satisfying the RLL=LLR^* relation with R and R^* being elliptic dynamical instanton R-matrices defined as transition matrices of the elliptic stable envelopes. Assuming a universal form of L, we define a comultiplication \Delta in terms of it. It turns out that the new vertex operators are intertwining operators of the U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor})-modules w.r.t \Delta.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper explores a theoretical approach to enhance RSA's resistance against quantum attacks by optimizing prime selection through R\'enyi entropy constraints. We develop a framework where primes are generated with controlled proximity ($|p-q| < \gamma\sqrt{pq}$) to minimize the collision entropy $\mathscr{H}_2$ of the quantum period-finding operator. The main contributions include: (1) establishing a connection between prime distribution properties and quantum attack complexity via Maynard's prime gap theorem, (2) providing a constructive proof for prime existence under entropy constraints, and (3) demonstrating security reduction to ideal lattice problems under the quantum random oracle model. Theoretical analysis suggests that for $k$-bit moduli with $\gamma < k^{-1/2+\epsilon}$, Shor's algorithm requires $\Omega(\gamma^{-1}k^{3/2})$ quantum operations while maintaining classical security equivalent to standard RSA. Key Enhancements: (1) Prime existence proof via Maynard's theorem (Theorem 3.1), (2) Ideal lattice embedding for SVP reduction (Theorem 5.3), (3) Quantum Fano bound for information-theoretic analysis (Theorem 6.3), (4) Multi-prime RSA extension (Section 7.3).</p></details>

Next, we introduce the notion of Nijenhuis operators on pre-Lie coalgebras and give their constructions, one from a linearly compatible pre-Lie coalgebra structure, and one from pre-Lie bialgebras. We then obtain a bialgebraic structure on Nijenhuis pre-Lie algebras by using dual representations and study their relations with \sss-equations and $\mathcal{O}$-operators. Finally we prove that a Nijenhuis balanced pre-Lie bialgebra produces a Nijenhuis Lie bialgebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In previous papers it has been shown that the coefficients of terms in the large-$N$ expansion of a certain integrated four-point correlator of superconformal primary operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory are rational sums of real-analytic Eisenstein series and "generalised Eisenstein series''. The latter are novel modular functions first encountered in the context of graviton amplitudes in type IIB superstring theory. Similar modular functions, known as two-loop modular graph functions, are also encountered in the low-energy expansion of the integrand of genus-one closed superstring amplitudes. In this paper we further develop the mathematical structure of such generalised Eisenstein series emphasising, in particular, the occurrence of $L$-values of holomorphic cusp forms in their Fourier mode decomposition. We show that both the coefficients in the large-$N$ expansion of the integrated correlator and two-loop modular graph functions admit a unifying description in terms of four-dimensional lattice sums generated by theta lifts of local Maass functions, which generalise the structure of real-analytic Eisenstein series. Through the theta lift representation, we demonstrate that elements belonging to these two families of non-holomorphic modular functions can be expressed as rational linear combinations of generalised Eisenstein series for which all the $L$-values of holomorphic cusp forms precisely cancel.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study central configurations when the set of positions is symmetric. We use a theorem from representation theory of finite groups to explore the symmetry properties of equations for central configurations. This approach simplifies equations for central configurations by considering arbitrary numbers of bodies, symmetry groups, and dimensions. We discuss how to use this theorem to obtain a more refined decomposition of the equations than that given before. The decomposition presented here uses the symmetry-adapted basis method. As an application, we give a complete description of the existence and which masses are possible for central configurations of two nested regular tetrahedrons, two nested regular octahedrons, and two nested regular cubes. To do this, we employ some methods of rational parameterizations and isolation of zeros of multivariate polynomials. The decomposition obtained allows symbolic calculations to be used to study the expressions. This way, we summarize previous discussions and extend them by completing the analysis on the cube case, for both the inverse and direct problems.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the average size of $\mathrm{Cl}_F[2]$ in the family of cubic fields $F = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{n})$. Specifically, as $F$ varies over the subfamily of wildly (resp. tamely) ramified fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{n})$, the average size of $\mathrm{Cl}_F[2]$ is $3/2$ (resp. $2$). This tame/wild dichotomy is not accounted for by the class group heuristics in the literature. Analogously, when the extensions $F = K(\sqrt[3]{n})$ of $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ are ordered by the norm of $n \in \mathcal{O}_K$, we show that the average size of $\mathrm{Cl}_F[2]$ is $3/2$, as is predicted by the Cohen--Martinet heuristics for $C_3$-extensions of $K$. Underlying our proofs is a reciprocity law for the relative class groups $\mathrm{Cl}_{F/K}[2]$ of odd degree extensions of number fields $F/K$. This leads us to propose class group heuristics for families of $K$-extensions with a fixed Galois $K$-group that explains the aberrant behavior in the family $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{n})$ and predicts similar behavior in other special families. The other main ingredient is the work of Alp\"oge--Bhargava--Shnidman on the number of integral $G(\mathbb{Q})$-orbits in a $G$-invariant quadric with bounded invariants.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An invertible matrix is called a Perron similarity if it diagonalizes an irreducible, nonnegative matrix. Each Perron similarity gives a nontrivial polyhedral cone, called the spectracone, and polytope, called the spectratope, of realizable spectra (thought of as vectors in complex Euclidean space). A Perron similarity is called ideal if its spectratope coincides with the conical hulls of its rows. Identifying ideal Perron similarities is of great interest in the pursuit of the longstanding nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem. In this work, it is shown that the character table of a finite group is an ideal Perron similarity. In addition to expanding ideal Perron similarities to include a broad class of matrices, the results unify previous works into a single, theoretical framework. It is demonstrated that the spectracone can be described by finitely-many group-theoretic inequalities. When the character table is real, we derive a group-theoretic formula for the volume of the projected Perron spectratope, which is a simplex. Finally, an implication for further research is given.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel class of prime-generating quadratic polynomials defined by $f_{Z,k,H}(n) = n^2 - (2Zk - 1)n + \frac{(2Zk - 1)^2 + H}{4}$, where $Zk \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ and $H$ belongs to the set of Heegner numbers. This form is closely related to the Euler-Rabinowitsch polynomials through specific substitutions. The structure enables algebraic tuning for prime-rich outputs and provides deeper insight into the impact of Heegner numbers on prime distribution. Using tools such as the Bateman-Horn conjecture and prime-counting functions, we demonstrate that this family can be optimized to generate a high density of primes. This work offers new directions for research in analytic number theory and potential applications in cryptography and signal processing.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The motivic coaction of multiple zeta values and multiple polylogarithms encodes both structural insights on and computational methods for scattering amplitudes in a variety of quantum field theories and in string theory. In this work, we propose coaction formulae for iterated integrals over holomorphic Eisenstein series that arise from configuration-space integrals at genus one. Our proposal is motivated by formal similarities between the motivic coaction and the single-valued map of multiple polylogarithms at genus zero that are exposed in their recent reformulations via zeta generators. The genus-one coaction of this work is then proposed by analogies with the construction of single-valued iterated Eisenstein integrals via zeta generators at genus one. We show that our proposal exhibits the expected properties of a coaction and deduce $f$-alphabet decompositions of the multiple modular values obtained from regularized limits.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we construct the stable derivator associated to a homotopically complete and cocomplete dg-category by explicitly defining homotopy Kan extensions via suitable weighted homotopy limits and colimits in dg-categories. By restricting the domain of the derivator to finite direct categories, we obtain a well-defined derivator even for pretriangulated dg-categories. This definition enables an explicit description of the derivator associated to a weakly idempotent complete Frobenius exact category, leading to a more direct characterization in terms of Gorenstein projective (equivalently, Gorenstein injective) diagrams.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the twisting of motivic $L$-functions by a family of multiplicative characters $\psi$, defined on prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}$ via $\psi(p)=\alpha^{N(\mathfrak{p})}$ for a fixed $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$. One can extend $\psi$ to a continuous non-Hecke character on the idele group of a number field. For $|\alpha|<1$, the resulting $\psi$-twisted $L$-function has interesting analytic properties: an enhanced half-plane of absolute convergence, preservation of the Euler product structure, and meromorphic continuation to the complex plane. We give applications to Dirichlet $L$-functions and $L$-functions associated to modular forms. Furthermore, we show that $\psi$-twisting allows the construction of convergent $p$-adic Dirichlet series and $p$-adic Euler products.</p></details>

Elkies conjectures that the rational points on $X_0(N)^*$ are only cusps or CM points when $N$ is large enough. We establish an integrality result for the $j$-invariants of non-cuspidal rational points on $X_0(N)^*$, representing a significant step toward resolving a key subcase of Elkies' conjecture. To this end, we prove the existence of rank-zero quotients of certain modular Jacobians $J_0(pq)$. Furthermore, we provide a complete classification of the rational points on $X_0(N)^*$ of genus $1 \leq g \leq 5$, when they are finite. In the process we identify exceptional rational points on $X_0(147)^*$ and $X_0(75)^*$ which were not known before.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present the first fixed-length elementary closed-form expressions for the prime-counting function, $\pi(n)$, and the $n$-th prime number, $p(n)$. These expressions are arithmetic terms, requiring only a finite and fixed number of elementary arithmetic operations from the set: addition, subtraction, multiplication, integer division, and exponentiation. Mazzanti proved that every Kalmar function can be represented as an arithmetic term. We develop an arithmetic term representing the prime omega function, $\omega(n)$, which counts the number of distinct prime divisors of a positive integer $n$. From this term, we find immediately an arithmetic term for the prime-counting function, $\pi(n)$. Combining these results with a new arithmetic term for binomial coefficients and novel prime-related exponential Diophantine equations, we manage to develop an arithmetic term for the $n$-th prime number, $p(n)$, thereby providing a constructive solution to the fundamental question: Is there an order to the primes?</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a toy model of a 3-dimensional topological quantum gravity. In this model, a contribution of a given 3-manifold is given by the partition function of an abelian Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT), with a topological boundary condition at the boundary. Using the fact that the TQFT partition function depends only on the first homology group of the 3-manifold with some additional structure, the sum over all 3-manifolds with fixed boundary can be rewritten as a sum over finitely generated abelian groups (and the extra structure). We present bounds on the universal weights in the sum, that is, the measure on the set of isomorphism classes of finitely generated abelian groups (with the extra structure) sufficient for the sum to be convergent. Moreover, with further assumptions on the measure, we argue the existence of a distribution of 2d TQFTs, such that the sum is equal to the ensemble average of their partition functions evaluated on the boundary. For a certain kind of measure, the sum over the abelian groups can be factorized into sums over abelian $p$-groups, and the analysis can be performed independently for each prime $p$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 38 pages; updated formatting, corrected typos, fixed minor mistake in Example 5.9, added Figure 7 illustrating wreath statistics for tableau

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of "color rules" for computing class functions of $Z_k \wr S_n$, where $Z_k$ is the cyclic group of order $k$ and $S_n$ is the symmetric group on $n$ letters. Using a general sign-reversing involution and a map of order $k$, we give a combinatorial proof that the irreducible decomposition of these class functions is given by a weighted sum over semistandard tableaux in the colors. Since using two colors at once is also a color rule, we are consequently able to decompose arbitrary tensor products of representations whose characters can be computed via color rules. This method extends to class functions of $G \wr S_n$ where $G$ is a finite abelian group. We give a number of applications, including decomposing tensor powers of the defining representation, along with a combinatorial proof of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for $Z_k \wr S_n$. Our main application is to the study of the linear action of $Z_k \wr S_n$ on bigraded affine semigroup algebras arising from the product of projective toric varieties. In the case of the product of projective spaces, our methods give the decomposition of these bigraded characters into irreducible characters, thus deriving equivariant generalizations of Euler-Mahonian identities.</p></details>

This approach enables us to reduce the block version of well-known results by the third and fourth authors to a question about almost simple groups. Moreover, this suggests a Galois analogue of the height-zero-equal-degree conjecture of Malle and Navarro, which we formulate. However, the "going up" case of irreducible extensions of principal block characters remains unresolved.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 62 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the map on Balmer spectra induced by a fully faithful geometric functor is a quotient map whose fibers are connected. This is an analogue of the Zariski Connectedness Theorem in algebraic geometry and it can be applied to a plethora of examples in equivariant and motivic mathematics. We isolate a significant source of examples by introducing the "concentration" of a tt-category at a well-behaved chosen set of compact generators. Various categories of cellular objects arise in this way. In particular, the "unitation" of a tt-category is the concentration at the unit object. We compute the Balmer spectrum of the unitation of the equivariant stable homotopy category as well as related categories arising in equivariant higher algebra. We also apply our results to the study of the comparison map of a tt-category. Among other results, we prove that the comparison map of a connective category is a quotient map with connected fibers. This involves studying the tt-geometry of weight complex functors, which may be of independent interest. We also study the relationship between the comparison map and the affinization of the Balmer spectrum viewed as a locally ringed space. These results provide a layered approach to understanding the spectrum of a given tt-category, by starting with the Zariski spectrum of the endomorphism ring of the unit, and then passing backwards to larger and larger concentrations (through quotient maps with connected fibers). Significant stages along the way include the passage to the unitation and the passage to the concentration at the Picard group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper aims to use a cluster-theoretic approach to give a kind of Diophantine equation whose solutions can be obtained by starting from initial solutions through mutations. We establish a novel framework bridging cluster theory and Diophantine equations through the lens of cluster symmetry. On the one hand, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for Laurent polynomials to remain invariant under a given cluster symmetric map. On the other hand, we construct a discriminant algorithm to determine whether the corresponding Laurent polynomial admits a cluster symmetric pair and whether it can be realized in a generalized cluster algebra. As applications of this framework, we solve two Diophantine equations, describe three classes of invariant Laurent polynomial rings, resolve two questions posed by Gyoda and Matsushita in \cite{Gyoda}, and lastly give two Matlab programs, respectively, for constructing invariant Laurent polynomials and finding cluster symmetric pairs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We deform the heat kernel and the Brownian motion on $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ from the perspective of "$(k,a)$-generalized Fourier analysis" with $k=0$. This is a new type of harmonic analysis proposed by S.Ben Sa\"id--T.Kobayashi--B.{\O}rsted from the representation theoretic viewpoint. In this paper, we construct the $a$-deformed heat kernel and $a$-deformed Brownian motion, and explore their some basic properties. We also prove that the $(k,a)$-generalized Fourier integral kernels are polynomial growth when $k=0$, for a justification of some discussions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In two papers entitled ``Two generalizations of almost perfect nonlinearity" and ``On the vector subspaces of $\mathbb F_{2^n}$ over which the multiplicative inverse function sums to zero", the first author has introduced and studied the notion of sum-freedom of vectorial functions, which expresses that a function sums to nonzero values over all affine subspaces of $\Bbb F_{2^n}$ of a given dimension $k\geq 2$, and he then focused on the $k$th order sum-freedom of the multiplicative inverse function $x\in \Bbb F_{2^n}\mapsto x^{2^n-2}$. Some general results were given for this function (in particular, the case of affine spaces that do not contain 0 was solved positively), and the cases of $k\in \{3,n-3\}$ and of $k$ not co-prime with $n$ were solved as well (negatively); but the cases of those linear subspaces of dimension $k\in [\![ 4;n-4]\!]$, co-prime with $n$, were left open. The present paper is a continuation of the previous work. After studying, from two different angles, the particular case of those linear subspaces that are stable under the Frobenius automorphism, we deduce from the second approach that, for $k$ small enough (approximately, $3\le k\leq n/10$), the multiplicative inverse function is not $k$th order sum-free. Finally, we extend a result previously obtained in the second paper mentioned above, and we deduce in particular that, for any even $n$ and every $2\leq k\leq n-2$, the multiplicative inverse function is not $k$th order sum-free.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. In this article, we classify all groups that can arise as $E(\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p))_{\text{tors}}$ up to isomorphism for any prime $p$. When $p - 1$ is not divisible by small integers such as $3, 4, 5, 7$, or $11$, we obtain a sharper classification. For any abelian number field $K$, the torsion subgroup $E(K)_{\text{tors}}$ is a subgroup of $E(\mathbb{Q}^{\text{ab}})_{\text{tors}}$. Our methods provide tools to eliminate non-realized torsion structures from the list of possibilities for $E(K)_{\text{tors}}$.</p></details>
