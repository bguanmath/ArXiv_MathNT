### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22640v1'>2509.22640</a>\]&nbsp; **High-dimensional quantum Schur transforms**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Adam Burchardt, Jiani Fei, Dmitry Grinko, Martin Larocca, Maris Ozols, Sydney Timmerman, Vladyslav Visnevskyi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** quant-ph &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The quantum Schur transform has become a foundational quantum algorithm, yet even after two decades since the seminal 2005 paper by Bacon, Chuang, and Harrow (BCH), some aspects of the transform remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, an alternative approach proposed by Krovi in 2018 was recently found to contain a crucial error. In this paper, we present a corrected version of Krovi's algorithm along with a detailed treatment of the high-dimensional version of the BCH Schur transform. This high-dimensional focus makes the two versions of the transform practical for regimes where the number of qudits $n$ is smaller than the local dimension $d$, with Krovi's algorithm scaling as $\widetilde{O}(n^4)$ and BCH as $\widetilde{O}(\min(n^5,nd^4))$. Our work addresses a key gap in the literature, strengthening the algorithmic foundations of a wide range of results that rely on Schur--Weyl duality in quantum information theory and quantum computation.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gustavo Jasso, Fernando Muro &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $d$ be a positive integer. In a previous article we established a bijective correspondence between the following classes of objects, considered up to the appropriate notion of equivalence: differential graded algebras with finite-dimensional $0$-th cohomology such that the canonical generator of their perfect derived category is a basic $d\mathbb{Z}$-cluster tilting object, and basic Frobenius algebras that are twisted $(d+2)$-periodic as bimodules. For $d=1$ this correspondence specialises to previous work of the second-named author on algebraic triangulated categories of finite type. In this article, we prove a variant of our general correspondence for bimodule right Calabi--Yau dg algebras. A novel ingredient is a new cohomology theory which contains obstructions to the existence and uniqueness of minimal $A_\infty$-bimodule structures on a graded bimodule.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** A. David Christopher &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The number of parts in the partitions (resp. distinct partitions) of $n$ with parts from a set were considered. Its generating functions were obtained. Consequently, we derive several recurrence identities for the following functions: the number of prime divisors of $n$, $p$-adic valuation of $n$, the number of Carlitz-binary compositions of $n$ and the Hamming weight function. Finally, we obtain an asymptotic estimate for the number of parts in the partitions of $n$ with parts from a finite set of relatively prime integers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages, accepted to LuCaNT 2025 conference proceedings. Version 2 addresses referee comments

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present results of quadratic Chabauty experiments on genus 2 bielliptic modular curves of Jacobian rank 2 that have recently been added to the LMFDB. We apply quadratic Chabauty methods over both the rationals and quadratic imaginary fields. In a number of cases, the experiments yielded algebraic irrational points among the set of mock rational points. We highlight specific notable examples, including the non-split Cartan modular curve $X^+_{ns}(15)$. Lastly, we offer a conjecture relating the level of the modular curve to the potential number fields over which points can arise.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nikolaos Diamantis, Joshua Pimm &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a previous work (arXiv:2505.05574), a summation formula for harmonic Maass forms of polynomial growth was established. In this note, we use the theory of $L$-series of harmonic Maass forms to state and prove a summation formula for such forms without any restrictions on their growth. We deduce a summation formula for the partition function. We further employ the same theory to derive a result on classical modular forms, namely, a summation formula and the asymptotics of a Riesz sum attached to a cusp form.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the density hypothesis for congruence subgroups of an irreducible uniform lattice in $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})^d$, extending previous results on the spherical density hypothesis to bound multiplicities of non-tempered non-spherical representations. Our bounds are uniform in the level as well as the spectral parameters.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22390v1'>2509.22390</a>\]&nbsp; **On sharpness in Local Converse Theorems for classical groups and $G_2$**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Moshe Adrian, Shaun Stevens &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove various results about the Local Converse Problem for split reductive groups $G$ over a non-archimedean local field~$F$ of characteristic $0$ and residual characteristic $p$. In particular, we prove that when $G$ is a symplectic or special orthogonal group, or the exceptional group $G_2$, and $p$ is large enough, then the optimal standard Local Converse Theorem for $G(F)$ requires twisting by representations of $GL_r(F)$ with $r$ up to half the dimension of the standard representation of the dual group of $G$. However, if we restrict to generic supercuspidal representations of $G(F)$ then it can be improved when $G=SO_{2N}$; we conjecture that the same is true for symplectic and odd special orthogonal groups. We also consider the possibility of using non-standard representations of the dual group to distinguish representations, giving counterexamples to possible improvements for general linear groups, $G_2$ and $SO_{2N}$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sungmun Cho, Jungtaek Hong, Yuchan Lee &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The ideal class monoid for an order $R$ in a finite field extension $E/F$ of a number field, denoted by $\overline{\mathrm{Cl}}(R)$, is a fundamental object to study in number theory which has useful applications in algebraic geometry and topology. In this paper, we describe an upper bound for $\#\overline{\mathrm{Cl}}(R)$, in terms of the class number of $E$ and (local) orbital integrals for $\mathfrak{gl}_n$. We also describe an upper bound for the class number of $E$ in terms of the Minkowski bound. When $[E:F]\leq 3$ or when $R$ is a Bass order, we refine our upper bound, using a known formula for local orbital integrals in the authors' previous work. In particular, if $R=\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^3-mx^2+(m-1)x-1)$ with $m\in \mathbb{Z}$ which arises in a study of Cappell-Shaneson homotopy 4-spheres in topology, then we further refine our upper bound in terms of the discriminants of $R$ and $E$, which is $\frac{2}{3^5} \Delta_R^{\frac{1}{2}}\cdot \Delta_E^{\frac{3}{2}}$, when $\Delta_E>3075$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yuchan Lee &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X$ be a $G$-homogeneous space over a number field $k$ such that $X\cong G_\gamma\backslash G$. Here, $G$ is a simply connected semisimple group over $k$ and $\gamma\in G(k)$ whose centralizer $G_\gamma$ is a maximal torus in $G$ which is anisotropic over $k$. We formulate the asymptotic for the number of integral points on $X$ bounded by a fixed norm $T>0$ as $T\rightarrow \infty$ in terms of $\kappa$-orbital integrals, which play a role in the stabilization of Arthur's trace formula. This formula coincides with the contribution of the stable conjugacy class of $\gamma$ to the geometric side of the trace formula. As an application, we obtain an asymptotic formula for the number of $n \times n$ matrices over the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_k$ whose characteristic polynomial equals a fixed irreducible polynomial $\chi(x)$ of degree $n$. This result generalizes a case studied by Eskin-Mozes-Shah (1996).</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14413v2'>2504.14413</a>\]&nbsp; **On the $p$-adic Skolem Problem**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Piotr Bacik, Joël Ouaknine, David Purser, James Worrell &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** cs.LO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Skolem Problem asks to determine whether a given linear recurrence sequence (LRS) has a zero term. Showing decidability of this problem is equivalent to giving an effective proof of the Skolem-Mahler-Lech Theorem, which asserts that a non-degenerate LRS has finitely many zeros. The latter result was proven over 90 years ago via an ineffective method showing that such an LRS has only finitely many $p$-adic zeros. In this paper we consider the problem of determining whether a given LRS has a $p$-adic zero, as well as the corresponding function problem of computing exact representations of all $p$-adic zeros. We present algorithms for both problems and report on their implementation. The output of the algorithms is unconditionally correct, and termination is guaranteed subject to the $p$-adic Schanuel Conjecture (a standard number-theoretic hypothesis concerning the $p$-adic exponential function). While these algorithms do not solve the Skolem Problem, they can be exploited to find natural-number and rational zeros under additional hypotheses. To illustrate this, we apply our results to show decidability of the Simultaneous Skolem Problem (determine whether two coprime linear recurrences have a common natural-number zero), again subject to the $p$-adic Schanuel Conjecture.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ángel González-Prieto, Javier Martínez, Vicente Muñoz &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 34 pages, 10 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper reinterprets Alexander-type invariants of knots via representation varieties of knot groups into the group $\textrm{AGL}_1(\mathbb{C})$ of affine transformations of the complex line. In particular, we prove that the coordinate ring of the $\textrm{AGL}_{1}(\mathbb{C})$-representation variety is isomorphic to the symmetric algebra of the Alexander module. This yields a natural interpretation of the Alexander polynomial as the singular locus of a coherent sheaf over $\mathbb{C}^*$, whose fibres correspond to quandle representation varieties of the knot quandle. As a by-product, we construct Topological Quantum Field Theories that provide effective computational methods and recover the Burau representations of braids. This theory offers a new geometric perspective on classical Alexander invariants and their functorial quantization.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19791v3'>2407.19791</a>\]&nbsp; **Locally analytic vectors and decompletion in mixed characteristic**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gal Porat &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Accepted version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In $p$-adic Hodge theory and the $p$-adic Langlands program, Banach spaces with $\mathbb{Q}_p$-coefficients and $p$-adic Lie group actions are central. Studying the subrepresentation of $\Gamma$-locally analytic vectors, $W^{\mathrm{la}}$, is useful because $W^{\mathrm{la}}$ can be analyzed via the Lie algebra $\mathrm{Lie}(\Gamma)$, which simplifies the action of $\Gamma$. Additionally, $W^{\mathrm{la}}$ often behaves as a decompletion of $W$, making it closer to an algebraic or geometric object. This article introduces a notion of locally analytic vectors for $W$ in a mixed characteristic setting, specifically for $\mathbb{Z}_p$-Tate algebras. This generalization encompasses the classical definition and also specializes to super-H\"older vectors in characteristic $p$. Using binomial expansions instead of Taylor series, this new definition bridges locally analytic vectors in characteristic $0$ and $p$. Our main theorem shows that under certain conditions, the map $W \mapsto W^{\mathrm{la}}$ acts as a descent, and the derived locally analytic vectors $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{la}}^i(W)$ vanish for $i \geq 1$. This result extends Theorem C of \cite{Po24}, providing new tools for propagating information about locally analytic vectors from characteristic $0$ to characteristic $p$. We provide three applications: a new proof of Berger-Rozensztajn's main result using characteristic $0$ methods, the introduction of an integral multivariable ring $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}_{\mathrm{LT}}^{\dagger,\mathrm{la}}$ in the Lubin-Tate setting, and a novel interpretation of the classical Cohen ring ${\mathbf{A}}_{\mathbb{Q}_p}$ from the theory of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules in terms of locally analytic vectors.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the action of the full twist is a Serre functor in the homotopy category of dihedral Soergel Bimodules. Our proof relies on the representability of a certain partial trace functor, which we prove using the diagrammatics for Hochschild cohomology of Soergel Bimodules. Leveraging these representability results, we then compute the triply-graded link homology of the Whitehead link.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The ring of dual integers is the bounded polynomial ring $\mathbb Z[\epsilon]=\mathbb Z[T]/(T^2)$ with integer coefficients. We describe the (finitely generated) Gorenstein-projective $\mathbb Z[\epsilon]$-modules as the torsionless $\mathbb Z[\epsilon]$-modules, or equivalently, as the perfect differential structures of abelian groups. Moreover, the stable category of G-proj$\mathbb Z[\epsilon]$ modulo projectives is shown to be equivalent to the orbit category $\mathcal D^b(\mathbb Z)/[1]$ of the derived category of the integers and to the homotopy category of perfect differential structures. We note that the category G-proj$\mathbb Z[\epsilon]$ is related to the embeddings of a subgroup in a free abelian group and has a quotient which is equivalent to the category of finite abelian groups. In fact, we present a cube which has as vertices eight related categories and as edges functors which are such that the faces of the cube give rise to commutative diagrams. Among interesting properties in G-proj$\mathbb Z[\epsilon]$, we note that uniqueness of direct sum decomposition fails.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages. This iteration incorporates improvements in exposition from referee's remarks, and updates the ancillary files. See https://burnolmath.gitlab.io/irwin for the source code repository on Gitlab

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the series of reciprocals of those positive integers with exactly $k$ occurrences of a given $b$-ary digit $d$ (Irwin series), and obtain for their sums geometrically convergent representations. They are expressed in terms of the moments and Stieltjes transforms of certain measures on the unit interval and involve certain recurrences which convert straightforwardly into a numerical implementation. This framework allows a new perspective on the limit for large $k$, and is the basis for obtaining, as the author has done in further works, the asymptotics for large $b$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Morton and Vivaldi defined the polynomials whose roots are parabolic parameters for a one-parameter family of polynomial maps. We call these polynomials delta factors. They conjectured that delta factors are irreducible for the family $z\mapsto z^2+c$. One can easily show the irreducibility for periods $1$ and $2$ by reducing it to the irreducibility of cyclotomic polynomials. However, for periods $3$ and beyond, this becomes a challenging problem. This paper proves the irreducibility of delta factors for the period $3$ and demonstrates the existence of infinitely many irreducible delta factors for periods greater than $3$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An isogeny class $\mathcal{A}$ of abelian varieties defined over finite fields is said to be "cyclic" if every variety in $\mathcal{A}$ has a cyclic group of rational points. In this paper we study the local cyclicity of Weil-central isogeny classes of abelian varieties, i.e. those with Weil polynomials of the form $f_\mathcal{A}(t)=t^{2g}+at^g+q^g$, as well as the local growth of the groups of rational points of the varieties in $\mathcal{A}$ after finite field extensions. We exploit the criterion: an isogeny class $\mathcal{A}$ with Weil polynomial $f$ is cyclic if and only if $f'(1)$ is coprime with $f(1)$ divided by its radical.</p></details>

> **Comment:** comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $X$ a smooth proper $K$-variety with good reduction. Under a mild assumption on the behaviour of Hodge numbers under reduction modulo $p$, we prove that the existence of a non-zero global 2-form on $X$ implies the existence of $p$-torsion Brauer classes with surjective evaluation map, after a finite extension of $K$. This implies that any smooth proper variety over a number field which satisfies weak approximation over all finite extensions has no non-zero global 2-form. The proof is based on a prismatic interpretation of Brauer classes with eventually constant evaluation, and a Newton-above-Hodge result for the mod $p$ reduction of prismatic cohomology. This generalises work of Bright and the second-named author beyond the ordinary reduction case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We derive a new Rademacher complexity bound for deep neural networks using Koopman operators, group representations, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). The proposed bound describes why the models with high-rank weight matrices generalize well. Although there are existing bounds that attempt to describe this phenomenon, these existing bounds can be applied to limited types of models. We introduce an algebraic representation of neural networks and a kernel function to construct an RKHS to derive a bound for a wider range of realistic models. This work paves the way for the Koopman-based theory for Rademacher complexity bounds to be valid for more practical situations.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 87 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There is considerable current interest in applications of generalised Lie algebras graded by an abelian group $\Gamma$ with a commutative factor $\omega$. This calls for a systematic development of the theory of such algebraic structures. We treat the representation theory and invariant theory of the $\Gamma$-graded general linear Lie $\omega$-algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(V(\Gamma, \omega))$, where $V(\Gamma, \omega)$ is any finite dimensional $\Gamma$-graded vector space. Generalised Howe dualities over symmetric $(\Gamma, \omega)$-algebras are established, from which we derive the first and second fundamental theorems of invariant theory, and a generalised Schur-Weyl duality. The unitarisable $\mathfrak{gl}(V(\Gamma, \omega))$-modules for two ``compact'' $\ast$-structures are classified, and it is shown that the tensor powers of $V(\Gamma, \omega)$ and their duals are unitarisable for the two compact $\ast$-structures respectively. A Hopf $(\Gamma, \omega)$-algebra is constructed, which gives rise to a group functor corresponding to the general linear group in the $\Gamma$-graded setting. Using this Hopf $(\Gamma, \omega)$-algebra, we realise simple tensor modules and their dual modules by mimicking the classic Borel-Weil theorem. We also analyse in some detail the case with $\Gamma={\mathbb Z}^{\dim{V(\Gamma, \omega)}}$ and $\omega$ depending on a complex parameter $q\ne 0$, where $\mathfrak{gl}(V(\Gamma, \omega))$ shares common features with the quantum general linear (super)group, but is better behaved especially when $q$ is a root of unity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop invariant theory for the quantum group ${\rm U}_q$ of $G_2$ at generic $q$ in the setting of braided symmetric algebras. Let ${\mathcal A}_m$ be the braided symmetric algebra over $m$-copies of the $7$-dimensional simple ${\rm U}_q$-module. A set of ${\rm U}_q$-invariants in ${\mathcal A}_m$ attached to certain acyclic trivalent graphs is obtained, which spans the subalgebra ${\mathcal A}_m^{{\rm U}_q}$ of invariants as vector space. A finite set of homogeneous elements is constructed explicitly, which generates ${\mathcal A}_m^{{\rm U}_q}$ as algebra. Commutation relations among the algebraic generators are determined. These results may be regarded as a non-commutative first fundamental theorem of invariant theory for ${\rm U}_q$. The algebra ${\mathcal A}_m$ is a non-flat quantisation of the coordinate ring of ${\mathbb C}^7\otimes{\mathbb C}^m$. As ${\rm U}_q$-module, ${\mathcal A}_m={\mathcal A}_1^{\otimes m}$ and we decompose ${\mathcal A}_1$ into simple submodules. The affine scheme associated to the classical limit of ${\mathcal A}_m$ is described. This is a rare case where the structure of a non-flat quantisation is understood.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Jiang and Rallis (1997) defined a family of local integrals attached to a cubic polynomial and proved explicit evaluations of them over a non-archimedean local field $F$, when either $F$ contains three third roots of unity, or the defining polynomial is reducible. The restriction on $F$ allowed them, among other things, to reduce the case of irreducible polynomials of the form $x^3-a$. Pleso (2009) began the work of removing the restriction on $F$ by expressing the integral as a sum of $16$ integrals for the cubic polynomial $x^3 - b x - c$ with $b,c\in F$, and computing nine of them. In this work, we compute $15$ of Pleso's integrals, and reduce the last to an elementary assertion about the number of points on a surface over a finite field, in the special case when $F$ is the $p$-adic numbers, $F=\mathbb{Q}_p$, and $p$ is equivalent to $5$ mod $6$. Our computations essentially complete Pleso's work in that special case. In the interim, Xiong (2020) has computed the integrals for an arbitrary non-archimedean local field by a totally different approach. Our direct approach might be more extendable to analogous integrals defined using quintic polynomials, in a higher-rank setting.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 101 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a framework for two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) in the language of analytic number theory. Attached to the torus partition function of every two-dimensional CFT is a self-dual, degree-4 $L$-function of root number $\varepsilon=1$, with a universal gamma factor determined by $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and local conformal invariance. Due to the richness of CFT operator spectra, these are not, in general, standard $L$-functions. We explicate their analytic structure, exploring the interplay of the Hadamard product over non-trivial zeros with the generalized Dirichlet series over CFT scalar primary conformal dimensions. We derive a zero sum rule in terms of the spectrum, and a global zero density bound in terms of the spectral gap. Convergence of the series representation implies square root cancellation of the degeneracies; we relate this to random matrix behavior of high-energy level spacings. Random matrix universality of the CFT implies "Riemann zeta universality" of the $L$-function: an average relation between the $L$-function on the critical line and Riemann zeta on the 1-line. This in turn yields a subconvexity bound. For a compact free boson, the $L$-function is a product of Riemann zeta functions times an analytic factor. Extensions to correlator $L$-functions and spinning spectra are briefly discussed. In the course of this work, we are led to sharpen the notion of random matrix universality in two-dimensional CFTs. We formulate a precise version of the following standalone conjecture, logically independent of $L$-functions: in unitary, compact Virasoro CFTs with central charge $c>1$, fixed-spin primary spectra at high energy are asymptotically simple, with random extreme gap statistics.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We find a group-theoretical condition under which a twist of a group algebra, in Movshev's way, admits an integral Hopf order. Let $K$ be a (large enough) number field with ring of integers $R$. Let $G$ be a finite group and $M$ an abelian subgroup of $G$ of central type. Consider the twist $J$ for $K\hspace{-0.8pt}G$ afforded by a non-degenerate $2$-cocycle on the character group $\widehat{M}$. We show that if there is a Lagrangian decomposition $\widehat{M} \simeq L \times \widehat{L}$ such that $L$ is contained in a normal abelian subgroup $N$ of $G$, then the twisted group algebra $(K\hspace{-0.8pt}G)_J$ admits a Hopf order $X$ over $R$. The Hopf order $X$ is constructed as the $R$-submodule generated by the primitive idempotents of $K\hspace{-1.1pt}N$ and the elements of $G$. It is indeed a Hopf order of $K\hspace{-0.8pt}G$ such that $J^{\pm 1} \in X \otimes_R X$. Furthermore, we give some criteria for this Hopf order to be unique. We illustrate this construction with several families of examples. As an application, we provide a further example of simple and semisimple complex Hopf algebra that does not admit integral Hopf orders.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a strong form of the cohomological integrality theorem, decomposing the cohomology of smooth symmetric stacks as the cohomological Hall induction of the intersection cohomology of the good moduli spaces of stacks of graded points. This generalizes the previous result by the second author together with Bu--Davison--Ib\'a\~nez Nu\~nez--P\u{a}durariu to non-orthogonal stacks, and confirms a conjecture of the first author that the algebraic BPS cohomology of the quotient stack of a symmetric representation matches the intersection cohomology group whenever it is nonzero. As a consequence, we obtain a version of the cohomological integrality theorem for general 0-shifted symplectic stacks with good moduli spaces, as well as for the character stacks of general compact oriented $3$-manifolds with reductive gauge groups. As an application, we prove Halpern-Leistner's conjecture on the purity of the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks admitting proper good moduli spaces. Our proof combines a cohomological bound for the algebraic BPS cohomology, due to the first author and based on Efimov's lemma, with a vanishing-cycle argument due to the second author in collaboration with Bu--Davison--Ib\'a\~nez Nu\~nez--P\u{a}durariu.</p></details>

We extend this compatible system by constructing a Weil group representation associated to $M$ for every place of $F$. To this end we generalize the Tate module construction to a tensor functor on $F_{\mathfrak{p}}$-isocrystals that are not necessarily pure. To prove that this yields a compatible system, we work out how that construction behaves under reduction of $M$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A noncommutative (NC) version of Poisson geometry was initiated by Van den Bergh by introducing at the level of associative algebras the formalism of double Poisson brackets. Their key property is to induce (standard) Poisson brackets under each representation functor. Then, Pichereau and Van de Weyer developed and studied the corresponding cohomology theory under the assumption that there exists a NC bivector defining the double Poisson bracket. Our first main result is that one can remove this assumption by constructing a completed double Poisson cohomology valid in any situation, hence generalizing the approach of Pichereau-Van de Weyer. As an application, we show that the double Poisson cohomology complex associated to the path algebra of a quiver is acyclic. Furthermore, we show that this new double Poisson cohomology theory can be adapted to weaker forms of double Poisson brackets (called quasi-Poisson and gauged Poisson), and that it is compatible with representation functors. A second focus of this memoir concerns the formalism of double Poisson vertex algebras. These were introduced by De Sole, Kac and the second author, as NC versions of Poisson vertex algebras, which induce the latter structures under each representation functor. Our second main result is the development of cohomology theories for double Poisson vertex algebras. These are NC analogues of the basic, reduced and variational Poisson vertex algebra cohomologies. More importantly, we prove that under each representation functor these cohomology theories are compatible with their commutative counterparts. As an application, we compute the double Poisson vertex algebra cohomology of the generalized NC de Rham complex and of the generalized NC variational complex. Finally, we describe the relation between the double Poisson algebra and double Poisson vertex algebra cohomologies using jet and quotient functors.</p></details>

This realization has some applications to the $p$-adic local Langlands program, including a locality theorem for Galois representations arising from classical automorphic forms, an admissibility result for coherent cohomology of Drinfeld curves, and some special cases of the Breuil's locally analytic Ext$^1$-conjecture for $\mathrm{GL}_2(L)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is a survey of a connection between the distribution of certain power residues modulo $p$, $p$ a prime, and relative class numbers. The focus lies on quadratic residues and sixth power residues. Dirichlet's class number formula yields a number of results about the distribution of quadratic residues, for instance, the well-known fact that the interval $[0,p/2]$ contains more quadratic residues than nonresidues. This class number formula is also responsible for some properties of the digit expansions of numbers $m/p$, $p\NDIV m$. In a certain sense the results based on Dirichlet's formula can be extended to sixth power residues, where geometry plays an important role.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix a rational prime $r \geq 5$. In this article, we study the integer solutions of the generalized Fermat equation of signature $(2p,2q,r)$, namely $x^{2p}+y^{2q}=z^r$, where the primes $p,q \geq 5$ are varying. For each rational prime $r \geq 5$, we first establish a condition on the solutions of the $S$-unit equation over $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_r+ \zeta_r^{-1})$ such that there exists a constant $V_{r}>0$ (depending on $r$) for which the equation $x^{2p}+y^{2q}=z^r$ with $p,q \geq V_r$ has no non-trivial primitive integer solutions. Then for each rational prime $r \geq 2$, we prove that every elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_r+ \zeta_r^{-1})$ is modular. As an application of this, we prove that the above constant $V_r$ is effectively computable. Finally, we provide a criterion for $r$ such that the equation $x^{2p}+y^{2q}=z^r$ with $p,q \geq V_r$ has no non-trivial primitive integer solutions when the narrow class number of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_r+ \zeta_r^{-1})$ is odd.</p></details>

The key new ingredient that we prove is a modular analog of the standard character formula for a cuspidal representation of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_\ell)$, an enhancement that allows us to easily compute the group cohomology of a $3$-adic lattice in such a representation. In fact, we provide a general framework for proving such modular analogs for a broader class of representations using results of Brou\'e and Puig in modular representation theory. We show that this class includes certain Deligne--Lusztig representations and representations coming from higher-depth supercuspidal representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a locally elliptic group, $(\Phi,\Psi)$ a complementary pair of Young functions, and $\omega: G \rightarrow [1,\infty)$ a weight function on $G$ such that the weighted Orlicz space $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is a Banach $*$-algebra when equipped with the convolution product and involution $f^*(x):=\overline{f(x^{-1})}$ ($f \in L^\Phi(G,\omega)$). Such a weight always exists on $G$ and we call it an $L^\Phi$-weight. We assume that $1/\omega \in L^\Psi(G)$ so that $L^\Phi(G,\omega) \subseteq L^1(G)$. This paper studies the spectral theory and primitive ideal structure of $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$. In particular, we focus on studying the Hermitian, Wiener and $*$-regularity properties on this algebra, along with some related questions on spectral synthesis. It is shown that $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is always quasi-Hermitian, weakly-Wiener and $*$-regular. Thus, if $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is Hermitian, then it is also Wiener. Although, in general, $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is not always Hermitian, it is known that Hermitianness of $L^1(G)$ implies Hermitianness of $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ if $\omega$ is sub-additive. We give numerous examples of locally elliptic groups $G$ for which $L^1(G)$ is Hermitian and sub-additive $L^\Phi$-weights on these groups. In the weighted $L^1$ case, even stronger Hermitianness results are formulated.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Building on the work of Yang, Key, and Muller, we investigate the spectral theory of solvable Lie algebras through their characteristic polynomials and associated spectral invariants. We begin by studying the general case: we compare two notions of spectral equivalence, establish the first known lower bound for the spectral invariant $k(L)$ via the weight decomposition of the nilradical, and introduce a new notion of spectral rigidity to study spectral equivalence within parameterized families. Then, we apply this framework to the classification of solvable Lie algebras with Heisenberg nilradical by Rubin and Winternitz, as we compute $k(L)$ and characteristic polynomials for all low-dimensional solvable extensions, construct the first explicit examples of spectrally equivalent yet non-isomorphic non-nilpotent solvable Lie algebras, derive two upper bounds for $k(L)$, and conclude by applying our rigidity criterion to these families.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $V$ be a $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra without nonzero elements of negative weights. We prove the conjecture that the spaces spanned by analytic extensions of pseudo-$q$-traces ($q=e^{2\pi i\tau}$) shifted by $-\frac{c}{24}$ of products of geometrically-modified (logarithmic) intertwining operators among grading-restricted generalized $V$-modules are invariant under modular transformations. The convergence and analytic extension result needed to formulate this conjecture and some consequences on such shifted pseudo-$q$-traces were proved by Fiordalisi in [F1] and [F2] using the method developed in [H2]. The method that we use to prove this conjecture is based on the theory of the associative algebras $A^{N}(V)$ for $N\in \mathbb{N}$, their graded modules and their bimodules introduced and studied by the author in [H8] and [H9]. This modular invariance result gives a construction of $C_2$-cofinite genus-one logarithmic conformal field theories from the corresponding genus-zero logarithmic conformal field theories.</p></details>

> **Comment:** rewrite to focus less on the formalism, flesh out more the applications. comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using a complex parameterizing rational spherical chains, we construct explicit cocycles for $\mathrm{GL}_n(\Q)$ valued in the motivic cohomology of (open subsets of) the algebraic $n$-torus $\mathbb{G}_m^n$. The resulting cocycles directly generalize the work of Sharifi and Venkatesh from the case $n=2$ \cite{SV}. Even in this special case, our systematic use of pushforwards allows us to avoid the use of their ``connecting sequences,'' and allows us to refine the construction and Hecke properties of the Sharifi map $\varpi$ to the maximal expected statements, while inverting only the prime $2$. For general $n$, the $d\log$ regulator of our cocycle is related by convex conical duality to cocycles constructed from Shintani cones. This affords a systematic approach to $p$-adic $L$-functions for totally real fields without need for auxiliary data or logarithm sheaf coefficients, including a distribution-valued $\GL_n(\Z)$-cocycle specializing in a simple way to all such $p$-adic $L$-functions. It moreover provides a direct conceptual link between polylogarithmic constructions of Eisenstein classes (e.g., in \cite{BKL}), and those constructed using Shintani cones (e.g., in \cite{CDG}). We also show how our formalism gives an alternate proof of the exceptional divisibilities of the Deligne-Ribet $2$-adic $L$-function in almost all cases.</p></details>

For example, let $p \geq 5$ be a prime, if $\left(\frac{-3}{p}\right)_L = -1$, then for all $n, k \geq 0$ with $p \nmid n$, we have \begin{equation*} b\left( 3p^{2k+1}n + \frac{p^{2k+2}-1}{2} \right) \equiv 0 \pmod{2}. \end{equation*} Let $p \geq 5$ be a prime and $1 \leq \ell \leq p - 1$ such that $\left( \frac{12\ell + 9}{p} \right)_L = -1$. Then for all $n, k \geq 0$, we have \begin{equation*} b\left(6p^{2k+3}n + \frac{3p^{2k+2}(4\ell+3)-1}{2}\right) \equiv 0 \pmod{36}. \end{equation*} Our techniques involve elementary $q$-series and Maple.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article we study the algebraic structure of fine Mordell--Weil groups, plus/minus Mordell--Weil groups, Selmer groups, and plus/minus Selmer groups in the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of abelian number fields. As a first, we prove theorems on the equivariant structure of fine Mordell--Weil groups and plus/minus Mordell--Weil groups. In other words, we study the explicit shape of the fine, plus/minus objects as a $\Lambda(\mathcal{G})$-module with $\mathcal{G} \simeq \mathbb{Z}_p \times G$ and $G$ a finite abelian group. We prove refinements of previously known results over $\mathbb{Q}$ for the classical Selmer group and the plus/minus Selmer group, and subsequently also the Shafarevich--Tate group, and the plus/minus Shafarevich--Tate group. This gives new evidence towards an affirmative answer for the Kurihara--Pollack problem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define new algebras, local bimodules, and bimodule maps in the spirit of Ozsvath-Szabo's bordered knot Floer homology. We equip them with the structure of 2-representations of the categorified negative half U^- of U_q(gl(1|1)), 1-morphisms of such, and 2-morphisms respectively, and show that they categorify representations of U_q(gl(1|1)^-) and maps between them. Unlike with Ozsvath-Szabo's algebras, the algebras considered here can be built from a higher tensor product operation recently introduced by Rouquier and the author. Our bimodules are all motivated by holomorphic disk counts in Heegaard diagrams; for positive and negative crossings, the bimodules can also be expressed as mapping cones involving a singular-crossing bimodule and the identity bimodule. In fact, they arise from an action of the monoidal category of Soergel bimodules via Rouquier complexes in the usual way, the first time (to the author's knowledge) such an expression has been obtained for braiding bimodules in Heegaard Floer homology. Furthermore, the singular crossing bimodule naturally factors into two bimodules for trivalent vertices; such bimodules have not appeared in previous bordered-Floer approaches to knot Floer homology. The action of the Soergel category comes from an action of categorified quantum gl(2) on the 2-representation 2-category of U^- in line with the ideas of skew Howe duality, where the trivalent vertex bimodules are associated to 1-morphisms E, F in categorified quantum gl(2).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the minimax problem for restricted two-fold self-sumsets in $k$-colorings of $\mathbb{Z}_n$. For primes $p$ with $2\le k\le p$ we determine the exact minimum $\max\{0,\,2\lceil p/k\rceil-3\}$. For general $n$ (with $m=\lceil n/k\rceil$) we bound the optimum between a size term $\min\{p(n),\,2m-3\}$ and a periodicity term $f\big(n/q(n,k)\big)$, and show these bounds are tight when $2m-3\le p(n)$ or $f\big(n/q(n,k)\big)\le \min\{p(n),\,2m-3\}$. We further prove a stability inequality and a threshold theorem that force concentration in a single subgroup coset near the periodic scale. In the prime case with $m\ge 5$ and $2m-3<p$, every optimal coloring contains a class of size $m$ that is an arc (an arithmetic progression up to an affine automorphism). Our approach combines the restricted Erd\H{o}s--Heilbronn phenomenon with block/coset colorings and an injectivity window.</p></details>

This allows us to provide various interesting examples of double Poisson vertex algebras, in particular from double quivers.</p></details>

In case i), assume that $\mu_{p^2} \subset F$. We give an elementary and unified proof that every representation $\rho_1: \Gamma \to \mathbf{GL}_d(\mathbb{F}_p)$ lifts to a representation $\rho_2: \Gamma \to \mathbf{GL}_d(\mathbb{Z}/p^2)$. [In case i), it is understood these are continuous.] The actual statement is much stronger: for all $r \geq 1$, under "suitable" assumptions, triangular representations $\rho_r: \Gamma \to \mathbf{B}_d(\mathbb{Z}/p^r)$ lift to $\rho_{r+1}: \Gamma \to \mathbf{B}_d(\mathbb{Z}/p^{r+1})$, in the strongest possible step-by-step sense. Here "suitable" is made precise by the concept of $\textit{Kummer flag}$. An essential aspect of this work, is to identify the common properties of groups i) and ii), that suffice to ensure the existence of such lifts.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1975, G. E. Andrews challenged the community to provide a proof that takes the summatory forms of the Rogers--Ramanujan $q$-series as input and directly establishes their modularity. This question is important because many different $q$-series appearing in combinatorics, representation theory, and physics often seem to be mysteriously modular, yet there is no general test to confirm this directly from the exotic $q$-series expressions. In this note, solve this general problem using $q$-series algebra and $q$-series systems of differential equations. Specifically, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for when holomorphic $q$-series on $|q|<1$ form a vector-valued modular function. This result offers a clear and conceptual path to modularity for "strange" $q$-series.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given positive integers $h, N$ satisfying $1 \leqslant h \leqslant 2N^2$, we define $T(h,N)$ to be the number of $2\times 2$ integer matrices with determinant equal to $h$ whose entries lie in $[-N,N]$. Our first result states that for any $\varepsilon >0$, one has $$ T(h,N) = \frac{16}{\zeta(2)} N^2 \bigg( \sum_{d |h} \frac{1}{d} \bigg) + O_{\varepsilon}(N^{\varepsilon} (N+ h)).$$ This quantitatively improves upon recent work of Afifurrahman and Ganguly--Guria. We further show that when $N^{1 + \delta} \leqslant h \leqslant 2N^2$ for any fixed $\delta>0$, the error term above is of roughly the right order. Our second result delivers an asymptotic formula for $T(h,N)$ with square-root cancellation whenever $h = N^2 + O(N)$. This error term is much stronger than its corresponding analogue in the smoothened version of this problem. More generally, for any $\varepsilon >0$ and any $N,h \in \mathbb{N}$ with $1\leq h \leq 2N^2$, we prove that $$ T(h,N) = \bigg( \frac{8}{\zeta(2)} - 4 \bigg)N^2 \bigg( \sum_{d |h} \frac{1}{d} \bigg) + O_{\varepsilon}(N^{\varepsilon}(N+ |h-N^2|)). $$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The periodic Temperley-Lieb category consists of connectivity diagrams drawn on a ring with $N$ and $N'$ nodes on the outer and inner boundary, respectively. We consider families of modules, namely sequences of modules $\mathsf{M}(N)$ over the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra for varying values of $N$, endowed with an action $\mathsf{M}(N') \to \mathsf{M}(N)$ of the diagrams. Examples of modules that can be organised into families are those arising in the RSOS model and in the XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain, as well as several others constructed from link states. We construct a fusion product which outputs a family of modules from any pair of families. Its definition is inspired from connectivity diagrams drawn on a disc with two holes. It is thus defined in a way to describe intermediate states in lattice correlation functions. We prove that this fusion product is a bifunctor, and that it is distributive, commutative, and associative.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a nonarchimedean local field with residue field of cardinality $q$, let $G$ be the $F$-points of a connected reductive group defined over $F$, let $P$ and $Q$ be two parabolic subgroups with the same Levi factor $M$. We construct intertwining operators $J_{Q|P}$ and the Harish-Chandra $j$-function $j^G$ for finitely generated smooth $A[M]$-modules, where $A$ is any commutative Noetherian algebra over $\mathbb{Z}' :=\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{q}^{-1}]$. The construction is functorial, compatible with extension of scalars, and generalizes the previously known constructions. We prove a generic Schur's lemma result for parabolic induction, which circumvents the need for generic irreducibility in defining $j^G$. Setting $A=\mathbb{Z}'$ and applying the construction to finitely generated projective generators produces a universal $j$-function that is a rational function with coefficients in the Bernstein center of $M$ over $\mathbb{Z}'$, and which gives the $j$-function of any object via specializing at points of the Bernstein scheme. We conclude by characterizing the local Langlands in families morphism (when it exists) for quasisplit classical groups in terms of an equality of $j$-functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $L/K$ be a cyclic extension of number fields, and let $S$ be a finite set of places of $K$ containing the ramified and Archimedean ones. We say that $L/K$ has the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property if, for any generator $\sigma \in \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$, the kernel of the arithmetic norm map $\mathrm{cl}^S(L)\rightarrow \mathrm{cl}^S(K)$ coincides with $(1-\sigma)\mathrm{cl}^S(L)$. We establish an effective criterion for the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property and investigate its connections with Iwasawa theory, in particular its relation to the Gross--Kuz'min conjecture. This yields a new method for verifying the property by explicit computation, with further links to the theory of spins of prime ideals. We conjecture that in the totally real case the property fails for at most finitely many primes, and we present numerical evidence supporting a heuristic toward this conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we obtain under the assumption of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis upper bounds for all high integral moments of sums of Fourier coefficients of a given modular form twisted by quadratic Dirichlet characters. We show the bounds are optimal by establishing unconditionally the corresponding lower bounds for all even integer moments.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce axioms for towers of infinite-dimensional algebras such that the corresponding Grothendieck groups of projective and finite-dimensional modules are Hopf dual to each other. This duality gives rise to an action of the Hesienberg double -- a generalization of the classical Hesienberg algebra -- on the Grothendieck group. We categorify this action and, as an application, construct a categorical realization of quantum differential operators on $\mathbb{A}^1_{\mathbb{Z}[v,v^{-1}]}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>What is the maximum number of $r$-term sums admitting rational values in $n$-element sets of irrational numbers? We determine the maximum when $r<4$ or $r\geq n/2$ and also in case when we drop the condition on the number of summands. It turns out that the $r$-term sum problem is equivalent to determine the maximum number of $r$-term zero-sum subsequences in $n$-element sequences of integers, which can be seen as a variant of the famous Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv theorem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\ell$ and $p \geq 3$ be different primes. Let $E/\mathbb{Q}_\ell$ and $E'/\mathbb{Q}_\ell$ be elliptic curves with isomorphic $p$-torsion. Assume that $E$ has potentially multiplicative reduction. We classify when all $G_{\mathbb{Q}_\ell}$-isomorphisms $\phi : E[p] \to E'[p]$ have the same symplectic type and prove two new criteria to determine the type in that case. In particular, when both curves have multiplicative reduction, our results cover the case of unramified $p$-torsion which is not covered by the original criterion due to Kraus and Oesterl\'e. We also give a variant of a symplectic criterion for the case when both $E$ and~$E'$ have good reduction and provide an algorithm to apply it. As an application, we determine the symplectic type of all the mod $p \geq 5$ congruences between rational elliptic curves with conductor $\leq 500 000$ that satisfy the hypothesis of either of our criteria at some prime~$\ell$.</p></details>
