 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ingrid Beltita, Daniel Beltita &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.OA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We verify the conjecture on continuous-trace subquotients for $C^*$-algebras of nilpotent linear dynamical systems, where by linear dynamical system we mean a continuous action of the additive group of real numbers by linear maps on a finite-dimensional real vector space. In addition, we show that the dimension of the ambient vector space can be recovered from the corresponding $C^*$-algebra and, if the action is nilpotent of degree two, the corresponding group is $C^*$-rigid within the class of 1-connected nilpotent Lie groups with coadjoint orbits of dimension $\le 2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using a previous novel way of defining kernel functions for Laplacian integral operators on a compact $p$-adic analytic manifold $X$, one such operator $Δ_0^s$ with $s\in\mathds{R}$ is applied to hearing the Serre invariant $i(X)$ by showing that a wavelet eigenvalue is always congruent to $i(X)$ modulo $q-1$, where $q$ is the cardinality of the residue field $k$ attached to a $p$-adic number field $K$. It is shown how the number of $k$-rational points of the special fibre of the Néron model of an elliptic curve defined over $K$ relates to the wavelet spectrum of $Δ^s_0$, and this then leads to the realisation that the Serre invariant $i(E(X))$ in the case of an elliptic curve $E$ with split multiplicative reduction vanishes modulo $q-1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A class number formula is proved for extended ring class fields $L_{\mathcal{O},9}$ over imaginary quadratic fields $K_d = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d})$, in which the prime $p = 3$ splits, by determining the fields generated by the periodic points of a well-chosen algebraic function. The number of periodic points of a given period $n \ge 2$ for this algebraic function equals six times the sum of class numbers of imaginary quadratic orders $\textsf{R}_{-d}$, for which the Artin symbol for a prime ideal divisor $\wp_3$ in $K_d$ of $3$ has order $n$ in the Galois group of $F_d/K_d$, where $F_d$ is the inertia field of $\wp_3$ in $L_{\mathcal{O},9}/K_d$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09031v6'>2005.09031</a>\]&nbsp; **Isogeny graphs of superspecial abelian varieties and Brandt matrices**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Bruce W. Jordan, Yevgeny Zaytman &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix primes $p$ and $\ell$ with $\ell\neq p$. If $(A,λ)$ is a $g$-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety, an $(\ell)^g$-isogeny of $(A,λ)$ has kernel a maximal isotropic subgroup of the $\ell$-torsion of $A$; the image has a natural principal polarization. We define three isogeny graphs associated to such $(\ell)^g$-isogenies -- the big isogeny graph $\mathit{Gr}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$, the little isogeny graph $\mathit{gr}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$, and the enhanced isogeny graph $\widetilde{\mathit{gr}}_{\!g}(\ell, p)$. We prove that all three isogeny graphs are connected. One ingredient of the proof is strong approximation for the quaternionic unitary group, which has previously been applied to moduli of abelian varieties in charateristic $p$ by Chai, Ekedahl/Oort, and Chai/Oort. The adjacency matrices of the three isogeny graphs are given in terms of the Brandt matrices defined by Hashimoto, Ibukiyama, Ihara, and Shimizu. We study some basic properties of these Brandt matrices and recast the theory using the notion of Brandt graphs. We show that the isogeny graphs $\mathit{Gr}_{\!g}(\ell, p)$ and $\mathit{gr}_{\!g}(\ell, p)$ are in fact our Brandt graphs. We give the $\ell$-adic uniformization of $\mathit{gr}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$ and $\widetilde{\mathit{gr}}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$. The $(\ell+1)$-regular isogeny graph $\mathit{Gr}_1(\ell,p)$ for supersingular elliptic curves is well known to be Ramanujan. We calculate the Brandt matrices for a range of $g>1$, $\ell$, and $p$. These calculations give four examples with $g>1$ where the regular graph $\mathit{Gr}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$ has two vertices and is Ramanujan, and all other examples we computed with $g>1$ and two or more vertices were not Ramanujan. In particular, the $(\ell)^g$-isogeny graph is not in general Ramanujan for $g>1$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** E. Dyachenko &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the problem of representing the fraction $5/P$ as a sum of three distinct unit fractions $1/A+1/B+1/C$ with $A<B<C$ and $A,B,C\in\mathbb{N}$. The case of primes $P\equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ is analyzed, where two constructive types of solutions arise: ED1 (exactly one denominator divisible by $P$, namely $C=cP$) and ED2 (exactly two denominators divisible by $P$, namely $B=bP$ and $C=cP$). Parametric constructions and enumeration algorithms are developed, including explicit transitions between ED1 and ED2. A deterministic algorithm is proposed, based on the intersection of a parametric lattice defined by pairs $(α,d')$ with bounded boxes. For each fixed prime $P\equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ the algorithm constructively produces a solution. Using analytic methods such as the Bombieri--Vinogradov theorem and the Chebotarev density theorem, it is shown that the density of admissible parameters is high, which yields polylogarithmic search complexity in the average case. A strict complexity guarantee for all primes remains conditional and depends on the finite covering hypothesis. This study extends previous work for coefficient $4$ (the Erdős--Straus conjecture) to coefficient $5$, transferring the same structure of parametrization and constructive solutions. Analytic applications provide averaging tools used for density estimates in parametric boxes.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tanush Shaska &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates the distribution of rational and algebraic points of bounded weighted height in weighted projective spaces over number fields. For a weighted projective space with weights q over a number field k of degree m, we derive an asymptotic formula for the count of such points, featuring a leading term D times X raised to m e Q, plus an error term, where e is the extension degree and Q is the sum of the weights. The constant D combines geometric aspects of the weights with an arithmetic obstruction given by the reciprocal of the gcd of the least common multiple of the weights and Euler's totient of m e. This obstruction stems from the non-surjectivity of the natural morphism from the weighted space to ordinary projective space on rational points, linked to nontrivial torsors under groups of roots of unity. We provide a cohomological interpretation, analogous to the Brauer-Manin obstruction. These findings refine a weighted version of the Batyrev-Manin conjecture and open avenues for applications in moduli theory and arithmetic geometry.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20316v1'>2511.20316</a>\]&nbsp; **On lattices over Fermat function fields**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Rafael Froner Prando, Pietro Speziali &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Function field lattices are an interesting example of algebraically constructed lattices. Their minimum distance is bounded below by a function of the gonality of the underlying function field. Known explicit examples--coming mostly from elliptic and Hermitian curves--typically meet this lower bound. In this paper, we construct, for every integer $n \geqslant 4$, a new family of lattices arising from the Fermat function field $F_n$ and the set of its $3n$ total inflection points. These lattices have rank $3n-1$, and we show that their minimum distance equals $\sqrt{2n}$, thereby exceeding the classical bound $\sqrt{2γ(F_n)} = \sqrt{2(n-1)}$. We also determine their kissing number, which turns out to be independent of $n$, and analyze the structure of the second shortest vectors. Our results provide the first explicit examples of function field lattices of arbitrarily large rank whose minimum distance surpasses the expected bound, offering new geometric features of potential interest for coding-theoretic and cryptographic applications.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe an algorithm to numerically evaluate Riemann theta functions in any dimension in quasi-linear time in terms of the required precision, uniformly on reduced input. This algorithm is implemented in the FLINT number theory library and vastly outperforms existing software. As an application, we evaluate the theta constants attached to certain special abelian varieties of dimension 6 to construct explicit polynomials of degree 65 over $\mathbb{Q}$ with conjectural Galois group $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{64})$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Mathieu Da Silva &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the proportion of conics given by $(\mathcal{C}_{\mathbf{F}, \mathbf{y}}) : F_0(\mathbf{y})x_0^2 + F_1(\mathbf{y})x_1^2 = F_2( \mathbf{y})x_2^2 $ which have a rational point $\mathbf{x} = (x_0 :x_1:x_2) \in \mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{Q})$, where $\mathbf{y} = (y_0 : \dots : y_n)\in \mathbb{P}^n(\mathbb{Q})$ and $F_0,F_1,F_2 \in \mathbb{Z}[X_0,\ldots, X_n]$ are homogeneous polynomials in many variables of the same degree $d$. We provide an asymptotic formula for the number of $\mathbf{y}$ of bounded height such that the corresponding conic $(\mathcal{C}_{\mathbf{F}, \mathbf{y}})$ has a rational point. In particular, our result agrees with the Loughran--Smeets and the Loughran--Rome--Sofos conjectures. Our strategy is based on a recent result of Destagnol--Lyczak--Sofos relying on the circle method to estimate the average of an arithmetic function over polynomials in many variables. To this end, we study the proportion of conics $t_0x_0^2 + t_1x_1^2 + t_2x_2^2 = 0$ having a rational point, and coefficients $t_0,t_1,t_2$ in arithmetic progressions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: 151 pages. minor changes on typos. Added: A workflow diagram; Section 5.5 on nearby cycles

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we construct good toroidal and minimal compactifications in the sense of Lan-Stroh for integral models of abelian-type Shimura varieties. We start with finding suitable types of cusp labels and cone decompositions which are compatible with those of the associated Hodge-type Shimura varieties. We then study the action of $\mathbb{Q}$-points of the adjoint group on boundary charts and toroidal compactifications of Hodge-type integral models. In particular, we extend the twisting construction of Kisin and Pappas to boundary charts. Finally, up to taking refinements of cone decompositions, we construct an abelian-type toroidal compactification as an open and closed algebraic subspace of a quotient from a disjoint union of Hodge-type toroidal compactifications and construct minimal compactifications with a similar method. Furthermore, we show results on nearby cycles of these compactifications and verify Pink's formula when the level at $p$ is an intersection of $n$ quasi-parahoric subgroups.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Lorenzo Furio, Davide Lombardo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 35 pages. Final version, to appear in Algebra & Number Theory

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Serre's uniformity question asks whether there exists a bound $N>0$ such that, for every non-CM elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ and every prime $p>N$, the residual Galois representation $ρ_{E,p}:\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}) \to \mathrm{Aut}(E[p])$ is surjective. The work of many authors has shown that, for $p>37$, this representation is either surjective or has image contained in the normaliser of a non-split Cartan subgroup $C_{ns}^+(p)$. Zywina has further proved that, whenever $ρ_{E,p}$ is not surjective for $p>37$, its image is either $C_{ns}^+(p)$ or a certain subgroup $G(p)$ of $C_{ns}^+(p)$ of index $3$. Recently, Le Fourn and Lemos showed that the index-$3$ case cannot arise for $p>1.4 \cdot 10^7$. We strengthen this result by proving that the image of $ρ_{E, p}$ is not conjugate to $G(p)$ for any prime larger than $5$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Alexandre Benoist, Jean Kieffer &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We generalize the notion of Elkies primes for elliptic curves to the setting of abelian varieties with real multiplication (RM), and prove the following. Let $A$ be an abelian variety with RM over a number field whose attached Galois representation has large image. Then the number of Elkies primes (in a suitable range) for reductions of $A$ modulo primes converges weakly to a Gaussian distribution around its expected value. This refines and generalizes results obtained by Shparlinski and Sutherland in the case of non-CM elliptic curves, and has implications for the complexity of the SEA point counting algorithm for abelian surfaces over finite fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a commutative noetherian ring $R$ and a finite acyclic quiver $Q$, we study the tensor triangulated category $\mathcal{D}(RQ)$ endowed with the vertexwise tensor product. We find a description of the internal hom functor and show that the category is not rigid.

After introducing the notion of tensor-t-structure, we give a classification of the compactly generated ones and prove the tensor telescope conjecture.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 29 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A=A(α, β)$ be a graded down-up algebra with weights $({\rm deg}\, x, {\rm deg}\, y)=(n,m)$ and $β\neq 0$, and $\nabla A$ the Beilinson algebra of $A$. Note that $A$ is a $3$-dimensional cubic AS-regular algebra. Assume that $\gcd(n, m)=1$ and $m \geq n$. If $n=1$ and $m=1$, then a description of the Hochschild cohomology group of $\nabla A$ was already known by Belmans. If $n=1$ and $m \geq 2$, then the dimensional formula of the Hochschild cohomology group of $\nabla A$ was given by the first author and Ueyama. In this paper, we give the dimensional formula of the Hochschild cohomology group of $\nabla A$ for the case that $n \geq 2$ and $m \geq 2$. As a byproduct of this dimensional formula, we prove that, for $m>n>1$, the derived category of a non-commutative projective scheme associated to $A$ is not equivalent to the derived category of any smooth projective surface. Moreover, we give the ring structure on the Hochschild cohomology group with the Yoneda product for the case that $m\geq n\geq 1$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 43 pages, LaTeX

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The affine vertex operator algebras for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and the Virasoro minimal models are related by Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction and by the Goddard-Kent-Olive coset construction. In this work, we propose another connection based on certain character identities between these vertex operator algebras and their modules. This relates the simple affine vertex operator algebras $L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at admissible levels $k=-2+q/p$ to the rational $(q,3p)$-minimal models $L_\mathrm{Vir}(c_{q,3p},0)$, and also extends to the nonadmissible levels with $q=1$. Several special cases are particularly interesting. In the nonadmissible case $q=1$, the character identities extend to certain abelian intertwining algebras, specifically $\mathcal{V}^{(p)}$ and the doublet $\mathcal{A}^{(3p)}$. Specialising further to $p=2$, where $\mathcal{V}^{(2)}$ is the simple small $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal algebra of central charge $c=-9$, this recovers, via the 4d/2d-correspondence, a known identity between the Schur indices of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $(3,2)$ Argyres-Douglas theory. In the boundary admissible case $q=2$, in a similar vein, we obtain an identity between the Schur indices of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Argyres-Douglas theories of types $(A_1,D_{2n+1})$ and $(A_1,A_{6n})$. On the other hand, for integral levels, $p=1$, where both involved vertex operator algebras are strongly rational, our character identity induces a Galois conjugation between the representation categories $\mathrm{Rep}(L_{-2+q}(\mathfrak{sl}_2))$ and $\mathrm{Rep}(L_\mathrm{Vir}(c_{q,3},0))$. We conjecture that the characters are related by the action of certain Hecke operators. Finally, we also sketch how to extend the results of this paper to relaxed highest-weight and Whittaker modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the framework of a generalized design, which represents any linear operator as a finite sum of local linear maps attached to finitely many points, thereby abstracting the core of design theory without employing integration. We then construct such a design on the space of sections of the tautological bundle over the complex projective line. By using the irreducible decomposition of this space as an SU(2)-representation, we show that the projection onto its lowest-dimensional summand can be realized as a finite sum of these local maps. Our construction relies on invariant theory for the binary icosahedral group and an analysis of fixed-point subspaces in symmetric tensor representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Montgomery in 1973 introduced the pair correlation method to study the vertical distribution of Riemann zeta-function zeros. This work assumed the Riemann Hypothesis (RH). One striking application was a short proof that at least 2/3 of zeta-zeros are simple zeros, the first result of its type. Over the last 50 years, most work on pair correlation of zeta-zeros has continued to assume RH. Here we show that if RH could be removed from Montgomery's simple zero proof, then this would also give a proof that 2/3 of the zeros are on the critical line. While at present we cannot unconditionally obtain this result, we have proved in joint work that this is true if we assume all the zeros are in a narrow enough region centered on the critical line. In separate joint work we use the same idea with a related pair correlation method to prove that assuming the Pair Correlation Conjecture, also without the assumption of RH, we obtain 100\% of the zeros are simple and on the critical line.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Continued fractions have been generalized over the field of $p$-adic numbers, where it is still not known an analogue of the famous Lagrange's Theorem. In general, the periodicity of $p$-adic continued fractions is well studied and addressed as a hard problem. In this paper, we show a strong connection between periodic $p$--adic continued fractions and the convergence to real quadratic irrationals. In particular, in the first part we prove that the convergence in $\mathbb{R}$ is a necessary condition for the periodicity of the continued fractions of a quadratic irrational in $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Moreover, we leave several conjectures on the converse, supported by experimental computations. In the second part of the paper, we exploit these results to develop a probabilistic argument for the non-periodicity of Browkin's $p$-adic continued fractions. The probabilistic results are conditioned under the assumption of uniform distribution of the $p$-adic digits of a quadratic irrational, that holds for almost all $p$-adic numbers.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Weronika Czerniawska, Ivan Fesenko &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The space of two-dimensional geometric adeles of a surface is far from being a locally compact space and there is no translation countably additive invariant nontrivial measure on it. At the same time, certain subquotients of the adeles are direct limits of compact subquotients or inverse limits of discrete subquotients, compatible in a special way. Using this fact, the paper defines a translation invariant measure and integration on certain subquotients of the geometric adeles of surfaces. This theory is considerably different from the theory of integration on analytic adeles of surfaces. After revising aspects of one-dimensional theory, the paper includes a full definition of two-dimensional geometric adeles. A number of their new topological properties are established. The new translation invariant measure and integration on selective subquotients of the geometric adeles is used for integrals of certain functions in a two-dimensional method describing the size of adelic cohomology groups of surfaces, without using standard adelic complexes. A formula for the Euler characteristic of the surface and its divisor in terms of integrals over subquotients of geometric adeles is proved. Using the Euler characteristic, a new two-dimensional adelic intersection number is introduced. For geometric surfaces it is a positive multiple of the standard intersection number. Several results in the previous study of geometric adeles are given new proofs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We extend based cluster algebras from the finite rank case to the infinite rank case. By extending (quantum) cluster algebras whose initial seeds are associated with signed words (arising from double Bott--Samelson cells), we recover infinite rank cluster algebras arising from representations of (shifted) quantum affine algebras. As a main application, we show that the fundamental variables of the cluster algebras arising from double Bott--Samelson cells can be computed via a braid group action when the Cartan matrix is of finite type. We also obtain the equality A=U for the associated infinite rank (quantum) cluster algebras. Additionally, several conjectures regarding quantum virtual Grothendieck rings due to Jang--Lee--Oh and Oh--Park follow as consequences. Finally, we show that the cluster algebras arising from representations of shifted quantum affine algebras, discovered by Geiss--Hernandez--Leclerc, admit natural quantizations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We solve the conjecture of Ginzburg, Guay, Opdam, and Rouquier regarding constructing highest weight covers of the Hecke algebra, in type D. Departing from existing Cherednik-algebra techniques, our new theory is based on an interplay between a natural generalization of dual Specht modules, and a Grothendieck spectral sequence for finite-dimensional algebras that admit (inverse) Schur functors. While the main result is regarding type $D_{2m} = G(2,2,2m)$, partial results are proved along the way for complex reflection groups $G(d,d,dm)$ and $G(m,1,d)$. Our framework should extend to all Weyl groups and general $G(m,r,n)$. A key ingredient in our methods is a unifying construction of modules over quantum wreath products, in terms of parabolic inductions on tensor products of the ``wreath modules'' introduced in the article. This construction simultaneously recovers (and hence provides a more transparent realization of) important families of modules in the literature, including simple modules over the Ariki-Koike algebra, (anti)spherical modules and the Kashiwara-Miwa-Stern modules over the affine Hecke algebra, as well as the Specht and simple modules over the Hu algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Harish-Chandra classified discrete series representations of real semisimple Lie groups by describing their characters as tempered distributions with an explicit formula on the elliptic set. His approach was inspired by Weyl's proof of the character formula for irreducible representations of compact Lie groups. Hecht, Miličić, Schmid and Wolf gave an alternative construction using the localization theory of Beilinson and Bernstein: the discrete series are the global sections of standard Harish-Chandra sheaves on the flag variety attached to the closed orbits of the complexification of a maximal compact subgroup. Their approach was inspired by the Borel-Weil theorem. In this paper, we give an explicit correspondence between these parametrizations. First, for a nilpotent radical $\mathfrak{n}$ of any Borel subalgebra, we establish a geometric formula for the $\mathfrak{n}$-homology of a module over the universal enveloping algebra of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, in terms of its localization on the flag variety of $\mathfrak{g}$. Then we give applications of the formula to the discrete series. First, we give a geometric proof of Schmid's result describing the $\mathfrak{n}$-homology of discrete series representations for the nilpotent radical $\mathfrak{n}$ attached to a Borel subalgebra containing the Lie algebra of a maximal torus. Using Osborne's formula, this gives the formula for the character on the elliptic set, and leads to the matching of Harish-Chandra's parameters for discrete series representations with the geometric parameters. This gives an alternative approach to the study of the discrete series. As an example, we deduce Blattner's conjecture on the multiplicities of K-types of the discrete series from the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem for the maximal compact subgroup.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f$ and $f'$ be genus $2$ cuspidal Siegel paramodular newforms. We prove that if their Hecke eigenvalues $a_p$ and $a_p'$ satisfy a non-trivial polynomial relation $P(a_p, a_p') = 0$ for a set of primes $p$ of positive density, then $f$ is a scalar multiple of a quadratic twist of $f'$. This result extends the strong multiplicity one theorem, which handles the case $P(x,y) = x - y$, to arbitrary polynomial relations. Our proof analyses the image of the product Galois representation attached to the pair $(f, f')$: we show that this image is as large as possible, unless $f$ is a twist of $f'$. Our results also apply to elliptic modular forms. They therefore provide a unified method for distinguishing both elliptic and Siegel modular forms based on their Hecke data, including their Hecke eigenvalues, Satake parameters, Sato--Tate angles, and the coefficients of their $L$-functions. We apply our methods to recover and generalise a range of existing results and to prove new ones in both the elliptic and Siegel settings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Since their introduction, torsion theories have played a key role in the study of abelian and pointed categories. In representation theory, torsion theories and lattices of torsion classes of mod$ A$, for $A$ a finite-dimensional algebra, have been widely studied. The more recent definition of pretorsion theories, that can be given for any category, has expanded the theory, giving many more instances of ``non-pointed torsion theories'' in unexpected settings. In this work, we introduce and study the lattice $\mathcal{L}_t(A)$ of pretorsion classes of mod$ A$. These lattices are in close connection with the lattices tors$ A$ of torsion classes of mod$ A$. We fully describe the completely join-irreducible elements of $\mathcal{L}_t(A)$. Moreover, we characterise and give a full classification of when $\mathcal{L}_t(A)$ is distributive and further describe when it can be identified with the \emph{distributive closure} of tors$ A$. Finally, we show how the lattices of pretorsion classes, together with their duals, can be used to build pretorsion theories in mod$ A$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unfolding singular points in linear differential equations is a classical technique for studying the properties of irregular singularities by relating them to regular singularities. In this paper, we propose a general framework for unfolding unramified irregular singularities of meromorphic connections on the trivial principal $G$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. One of our main results is the description of the unfolding of singularities in terms of deformations of their moduli spaces. We show that every moduli space of irreducible meromorphic $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ can be deformed into a moduli space of irreducible Fuchsian $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. Furthermore, we study the unfolding of additive Deligne-Simpson problems, in which the unfolding of irregular singularities naturally generates a family of such problems. As an application of our main result, we prove that a Deligne-Simpson problem for $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities admits a solution if and only if every unfolded Deligne-Simpson problem in the family admits a simultaneous solution. We also provide a combinatorial and diagrammatic framework of the unfolding process in terms of spectral types and unfolding diagrams. Finally, we address a conjecture proposed by Oshima concerning the existence of irreducible $G$-connections that realize prescribed spectral types and their unfoldings. Our main result gives an affirmative answer to this conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the study of minimal torsion curves within a fixed geometric isogeny class. For a $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-isogeny class $\mathcal{E}$ of elliptic curves and $N \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, we wish to determine the least degree of a point on the modular curve $X_1(N)$ associated to any $E \in \mathcal{E}$. In the present work, we consider the cases where $\mathcal{E}$ is rational, i.e., contains an elliptic curve with rational $j$-invariant, or where $\mathcal{E}$ consists of elliptic curves with complex multiplication (CM). If $N=\ell^k$ is a power of a single prime, we give a complete characterization upon restricting to points of odd degree, and also in the case where $\mathcal{E}$ is CM. We include various partial results in the more general setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $Γ$ denote a distance-regular graph with vertex set $X$ and diameter $D \geq 3$. Fix a vertex $x \in X$. Let the field $\mathbb{F}$ be either $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. Let $\mathrm{Mat}_X(\mathbb{F})$ denote the $\mathbb{F}$-algebra of matrices whose rows and columns are indexed by $X$ and all entries in $\mathbb{F}$. The Terwilliger algebra $T^\mathbb{F} = T^\mathbb{F}(x)$ is the subalgebra of $\mathrm{Mat}_X(\mathbb{F})$ generated by the adjacency matrix $A$ of $Γ$ and the dual primitive idempotents $\{E_i^*\}_{i=0}^D$ of $Γ$ with respect to $x$. Let $\{E_i\}_{i=0}^D$ denote the primitive idempotents of $A$. Assume that the ordering $\{E_i\}_{i=0}^D$ is $Q$-polynomial. Let $W$ denote an irreducible $T^\mathbb{F}$-module. We say that $W$ is sharp over $\mathbb{F}$ whenever $\dim (E_r^* W) = 1$, where $r$ is the endpoint of $W$. It is known, by Nomura and Terwilliger (2008), that every irreducible $T^\mathbb{C}$-module is sharp. In this paper, we prove that every irreducible $T^\mathbb{R}$-module is sharp. Once this is established, we obtain four additional results: (i) if $W$ is an irreducible $T^\mathbb{R}$-module, then its complexification $W^\mathbb{C}= W \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C}$ is an irreducible $T^\mathbb{C}$-module; (ii) two irreducible $T^\mathbb{R}$-modules $W_1$ and $W_2$ are isomorphic if and only if their complexifications $W_1^\mathbb{C}$ and $W_2^\mathbb{C}$ are isomorphic as $T^\mathbb{C}$-modules; (iii) if $\bigoplus_{i=1}^h \mathrm{Mat}_{n_i}(\mathbb{C})$ is the Wedderburn decomposition of $T^\mathbb{C}$, then $\bigoplus_{i=1}^h \mathrm{Mat}_{n_i}(\mathbb{R})$ is the Wedderburn decomposition of $T^\mathbb{R}$; (iv) each of the subalgebras $E_1^* T E_1^*$, $E_1 T E_1$, $E_D^* T E_D^*$, and $E_D T E_D$ is commutative and every element of these algebras is a symmetric matrix.</p></details>

Our construction relies on a new theta operator and its $p$-adic variation which plays a role analogous to the classical Ramanujan-Serre theta operator in Hida's $p$-adic Rankin-Selberg method. The interpolation formula, including the modified Euler factors at $p$ and at the real place, is consistent with the conjectural shape of $p$-adic $L$-functions predicted by Coates and Perrin-Riou.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 29 pages. This is a revision of the part on stable equivalences in arXiv:2312.08794. New results are added. We stress that every finite-dimensional algebra over a field R is isomorphic to the centralizer of two matrices in a full matrix algebra over the field R. Thus the class of all centralizers of one matrix is an impotent part of finite-dimensonal algebras over fields

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As is known, every finite-dimensional algebra over a field is isomorphic to the centralizer algebra of two matrices. So it is fundamental to study first the centralizer algebra of a single matrix, called a centralizer matrix algebra. In this article, stable equivalences between centralizer matrix algebras over arbitrary fields are completely characterized in terms of a new equivalence relation on matrices. Moreover, stable equivalences of centralizer matrix algebras over perfect fields induce stable equivalences of Morita type, thus preserve dominant, finitistic and global dimensions. Our methods also show that algebras stably equivalent to a centralizer matrix algebra over a field have the same number of non-isomorphic, non-projective simple modules. Thus the Auslander--Reiten conjecture on stable equivalences holds true for centralizer matrix algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Vafa-Witten observed that Yoshioka's blow-up formula for the Euler characteristics of rank $r$ instantons on an algebraic surface coincides with the character of the Wess-Zumino-Witten model for $\mathrm{SU}(r)$ at level $1$, and raised the question of finding a rational conformal field theory explanation for this striking coincidence. In this work, we provide an answer to this question by constructing and analyzing the affine $\mathrm{gl}_r$ action on various cohomology theories, including the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves, Hochschild homology, Chow groups, and Hodge cohomology, of the moduli space of stable sheaves on a blown-up surface. A key ingredient in our proof is a representation-theoretic reformulation of the theory of Grassmannians of Tor-amplitude $[0,1]$-perfect complexes studied by the first-named author in terms of the spin representation of the finite-dimensional Clifford algebra. This may be viewed as a finite analog of the question of Vafa-Witten via the Boson-Fermion correspondence.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Mahler equations arise in a wide range of contexts including the study of finite automata, regular sequences, algebraic series over Fp(z), and periods of Drinfeld modules. Introduced a century ago by K. Mahler to study the transcendence of certain complex numbers, they have recently been the subject of several works establishing a deep connection between such transcendence properties and the nature of their solutions. While numerous studies have investigated these solutions, existing algorithms can only compute them in specific rings: rational functions, power series, Puiseux series, or Hahn series. This paper solves the problem by providing an algorithm that computes a complete basis of solutions for any Mahler equation, along with a decomposition of each solution over the field of Puiseux series. Along the way, we describe an algorithm that computes a fundamental matrix of solutions for any Mahler system.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given an elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ and non-zero integer $r$, the Lang--Trotter conjecture predicts a striking asymptotic formula for the number of good primes $p\leqslant x$, denoted by $π_{E,r}(x)$, such that the Frobenius trace of $E$ at $p$ is equal to the given integer $r$. We focus on the CM case in this memoir, and show how to realize the following two goals: (1) to give an unconditional estimate for $π_{E,r}(x)$, which confirms the upper bound part of the conjecture up to a constant multiple; (2) to give a conditional explicit asymptotic formula for $π_{E,r}(x)$ based on the Hardy--Littlewood conjecture on primes represented by quadratic polynomials. For completeness, we also summarize classical results on quadratic, cubic and quartic residues, as well as the corresponding reciprocity laws. This part should be of independent interests and could provide useful materials for more junior readers. We also highlight some possible extensions of the arguments in this memoir that may work for other statistical problems of CM elliptic curves.</p></details>

The proof reduces to bounding a quintilinear sum of Kloosterman sums, to which we introduce a new shifting argument inspired by Vinogradov--Burgess--Karatsuba, going beyond the classical Fourier-analytic approach thanks to a deep algebro-geometric result of Kowalski--Michel--Sawin on sums of products of Kloosterman sums.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce integer sequences satisfying new congruence properties inspired by the Euler and Gauss congruences, which we call Euler-Gauss sequences. Noting that every Gauss sequence is an Euler-Gauss sequence, we compare them with certain generalizations of Gauss sequences and provide several counterexamples. In particular, the important Smallest Prime Factor (SPF) and Greatest Prime Factor (GPF) sequences (suitably defined at 1) are Euler-Gauss sequences but not Gauss sequences. We further extend these congruence-based integer sequences to a q-analog setting and establish characteristic properties that reveal their structure and fill gaps in the literature on q-Gauss sequences. In recent works, q-Gauss sequences have been shown to admit interesting combinatorial interpretations and to exhibit the Cyclic Sieving Phenomenon (CSP). Not only do our q-Euler-Gauss sequences satisfy the standard CSP with some restriction, but we also derive a new CSP condition for the SPF and GPF sequences, not hitherto known in the literature.</p></details>

We also provide some observations on the behavior of the totient function with an arbitrary jth elementary symmetric polynomial. We then outline a method for solving a certain the restricted linear congruence problem with a greatest common divisor constraint on a quadratic form, illustrated by a concrete example. Most importantly, we demonstrate the equivalence between obtaining product forms for generalized totient functions, counting zeros of specific polynomials over finite fields, and resolving a broad class of restricted linear congruence problems .</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Vertex algebras (and their modules) can be described as vector spaces together with a linear operator-valued series in one parameter $z$. With the interpretation of $z$ as a coordinate at a point on a curve, one can construct algebraic structures on the moduli space of curves from $V$-modules. Here we propose a generalization of vertex algebras involving linear operators in parameters $z_1,\ldots,z_n$. One may interpret these as being the components of a set of coordinates on an $n$-dimensional algebraic variety. These are referred to as cohomological vertex algebras (CVAs): the formal punctured 1-disk underlying a vertex algebra is replaced by a ring modeling the cohomology of certain modifications of the formal $n$-disk. We prove several structural theorems for CVAs and give a definition of cohomological vertex operator algebras (CVOAs). Using a reconstruction theorem for CVAs, we provide basic examples such as the $βγ$-system, the Heisenberg CVA, and the affine Kac-Moody CVAs. We use these constructions to describe BRST reduction, leading to an analog of W-algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic, $\mathfrak{g}$ be its Lie algebra, and $B$ be a Borel subgroup. We prove a formula for the dimensions of extension groups, in the principal block of the category of strongly $B$-equivariant $\mathfrak{g}$-modules (also called modular category $\mathcal{O}$), from a simple object to a costandard object, under the assumption that Lusztig's conjecture holds (which is known in large characteristic). The answer is given by a coefficient of a periodic Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial associated with the corresponding affine Weyl group. Among other things, the proof uses a torus-equivariant version of the Koszul duality for $\mathfrak{g}$-modules constructed by the first author.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a new quadratic Chabauty method to compute the integral points on certain even degree hyperelliptic curves. Our approach relies on a nontrivial degree zero divisor supported at the two points at infinity to restrict the $p$-adic height to a linear function; we can then express this restriction in terms of holomorphic Coleman integrals under the standard quadratic Chabauty assumption. Then we use this linear relation to extract the integral points on the curve. We also generalize our method to integral points over number fields. Our method is significantly simpler and faster than all other existing versions of the quadratic Chabauty method. We give examples over $\Q$ and $\Q(\sqrt{7})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is an introduction to the finite groups, with focus on the groups of permutations and reflections, and more generally, on the finite groups of unitary matrices. We first discuss the basics of group theory, featuring the cyclic, dihedral and symmetric groups, and the structure result for finite abelian groups. Then we study the complex reflection groups, with general theory and examples, classification results, and with a look into braid groups too. We then go into the study of representation theory, and of more advanced aspects, such as Tannakian duality, Brauer theorems and Clebsch-Gordan rules. Finally, we discuss, using representation theory methods, a number of advanced analytic aspects, for the most in relation with questions coming from probability.</p></details>

This improves a recent result of Tsuda. We also demonstrate that a straightforward application of the Maynard-Tao method is insufficient to improve this bound. However, it allows us to establish the existence of bounded gaps between Goldbach primes with bounded error for almost all even integers $N$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1973 Montgomery formulated the pair correlation conjecture, predicting that the local spacing statistics of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function coincide with those of eigenvalues of large Hermitian matrices from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). The zeta function, however, is a fixed deterministic object, and the mechanism by which its zeros reproduce random matrix statistics has remained unclear. In this paper, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we prove Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of Hardy's $Z$-function. Building on earlier works, we use a finite-dimensional variational space of sections $Z_N(t;a)$ that approximate $Z(t)$ on each window $[2N,2N+2]$. Inside this space we define the real hall $\mathcal{RH}_N(\mathbb{R})$, consisting of those sections whose zeros in the corresponding critical rectangle are real, simple, and remain so along any homotopy from the core section. This real hall plays the role of a random matrix ensemble. Equipping it with a probability measure with smooth, strictly positive density on the coefficient space, we construct a Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equation with reflection at the discriminant boundary. We show that the induced dynamics of the unfolded zeros are, in the bulk, equivalent in law to Dyson Brownian motion with $β=2$, and by invoking modern universality results for Dyson Brownian motion and log-gases we obtain that, for any such measure, the ensemble-averaged local pair-correlation converges to the GUE sine-kernel law. Finally, using Selberg's probabilistic theory of the argument $S(t)$, we prove that the pair-correlation observables of the canonical approximants $Z_N(t;1)$ over disjoint windows behave asymptotically like decorrelated samples drawn from this GUE-distributed ensemble, and we upgrade the averaged GUE law to a deterministic pair-correlation law for the zeros of $Z(t)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(a_n)_{n \geq 1}$ be a sequence of distinct positive integers. The metric theory of minimal gaps for the sequence $\{αa_n \text{ mod }1, 1\leq n \leq N\}$ as $N \to \infty$ was initiated by Rudnick, who established that the minimal gap admits an asymptotic upper bound expressible in terms of the additive energy of $\{a_1,\ldots,a_N\}$ for almost every $α$. Later, Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch demonstrated that the metric theory of minimal gaps for such sequences is governed not by the additive energy, but by the cardinality of the difference set of $\{a_1,\ldots,a_N\}$. They established a sharp convergence test for the typical asymptotic order of the minimal gap and proved general upper and lower bounds that are readily applicable. A key element of their proof relies on the resolution of the Duffin--Schaeffer conjecture by Koukoulopoulos and Maynard. In this article, we generalise several results from the article of Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch on \emph{integer} sequences to the case of \emph{real} sequences. While an upper bound for $δ_{\min}^α(N)$ remains elusive, we obtain one for its floored counterpart $\lfloor δ^α_{\min} \rfloor (N)$ for real sequences $(a_n)_{n \geq 1}$ of distinct numbers. Our theorems recover Theorems 1-3, as well as the result from Section 4.3 of the article by Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds for the minimal gaps of well-spaced sequences and, more generally, of a broader family that contains them.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a finite group. A finite collection of elements from $G$, where the order is disregarded and repetitions are allowed, is said to be a product-one sequence if its elements can be ordered such that their product in $G$ equals the identity element of $G$. Then, the Gao's constant $\mathsf E (G)$ of $G$ is the smallest integer $\ell$ such that every sequence of length at least $\ell$ has a product-one subsequence of length $|G|$. For a positive integer $n$, we denote by $C_n$ a cyclic group of order $n$. Let $G = C_n \rtimes_s C_2$ with $s^2\equiv 1\pmod n$ be a metacyclic group. The direct and inverse problems of $\mathsf E (G)$ were settled recently, except for the case that $G=C_{3n_2}\rtimes_s C_2$ with $n_2\neq 1$, $\gcd(n_2,6)=1$, $s\equiv -1 \pmod 3$, and $s\equiv 1\pmod {n_2}$. In this paper, we complete the remaining case and hence for all metacyclic groups of the form $G=C_n \rtimes C_2$, the Gao's constant and the associated inverse problem are now fully settled (see Theorem 1.2).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Riemann-Hilbert method is employed to carry out an asymptotic analysis of a family of $σ$-Painlevé V functions associated with Hankel determinants involving the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind. In the large-matrix limit, this family degenerates to a family of $σ$-Painlevé III$'$ functions, whose precise asymptotic behavior is also obtained. Both families of Painlevé functions arise in the study of the joint moments of the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of a CUE random matrix and the polynomial itself, whose asymptotics are closely related to the moments of the Riemann zeta function and the Hardy $\mathsf{Z}$-function on the critical line. One of our main results establishes a representation of the leading coefficients of these joint moments in terms of $σ$-Painlevé III$'$ functions for general real exponents. The other main result resolves a question of Assiotis et al. in [Probab. Math.

Their algorithm only works for modules whose generators and relations are distinctly graded. We extend their approach to work on \emph{all} finitely presented modules and introduce several improvements that lead to significant speed-ups in practice. Our algorithm is fixed parameter tractable with respect to the maximal number of relations with the same degree and with further optimisation we obtain an $O(n^3)$ algorithm for interval-decomposable modules. In particular, we can decide interval-decomposability in this time. As a by-product to the proofs of correctness we develop a theory of parameter restriction for persistence modules. Our algorithm is implemented as a software library \textsc{aida} which is the first to enable the decomposition of large inputs.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be an abelian variety defined over a number field $K$ and $\hat{h}$ be the Néron-Tate height on $A(\overline{K})$ corresponding to a symmetric ample line bundle on $A$. Let $\mathcal{K}/K$ be an asymptotically positive infinite extension as defined in \cite{AB-SK} which includes infinite Galois extensions with finite local degree at a non-archimedean place. In this article, we prove that the Néron-Tate height of non-torsion points in $A(\mathcal{K})$ is bounded below by an absolute constant depending only on $A$, $K$, and $\mathcal{K}$. As a consequence, we obtain the Bogomolov property for totally $p$-adic points of an abelian variety $A/\mathbb{Q}$ in the case when $A$ has good reduction at $p$. This is the first instance where such a result has been obtained in the good reduction case; previously, it was known only in the bad reduction case via Gubler's tropical equidistribution theorem. Moreover, our result also implies the finiteness of torsion points in $A(\mathcal{K})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that Lusztig's semi-infinite Deligne--Lusztig variety for $\mathrm{GSp}$ (and its inner form) is isomorphic, as a set with action, to an affine Deligne--Lusztig variety at infinite level, generalizing a result of Chan--Ivanov. Furthermore, we show that a component of some affine Deligne--Lusztig variety $X^0_{w_r}(b)_{\mathcal{L}}$ for $\mathrm{GSp}$ can be written, up to perfection, as a direct product of a classical Deligne--Lusztig variety with an affine space. We also study the varieties $X_h$ defined by Chan and Ivanov, and show that $X_h$ at infinite level can be realized as a subset of semi-infinite Deligne--Lusztig varieties defined using components of affine Deligne--Lusztig varieties such as $X^0_{w_r}(b)_{\mathcal{L}}$ above, even in the $\mathrm{GSp}$ case. This reinterprets previous constructions of representations from $X_h$ as instances of Lusztig's conjectural picture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using the subdivision schemes theory, we develop a criterion to check if any natural number has at most one representation in the $n$-ary number system with a set of non-negative integer digits $A=\{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n\}$ that contains zero. This uniqueness property is shown to be equivalent to a certain restriction on the roots of the trigonometric polynomial $\sum_{k=1}^n e^{-2πi a_k t}$. From this criterion, under a natural condition of irreducibility for $A$, we deduce that in case of prime $n$ the uniqueness holds if and only if the digits of $A$ are distinct modulo $n$, whereas for any composite $n$ we show that the latter condition is not necessary. We also establish the connection of this uniqueness to the semigroup freeness problem for affine integer functions of equal integer slope; this together with the two criteria allows to fill the gap in the work of D. Klarner on the question of P. Erdös about densities of affine integer orbits and establish a simple algorithm to check the freeness and the positivity of density when the slope is a prime number.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We generalize the classification of isomorphism classes of Schubert varieties in complete flag varieties G/B to a class of partial flag varieties G/P. In particular, we classify all Schubert varieties in G/P where P is a minimal parabolic subgroup and all Schubert surfaces. We also obtain several pairs of isomorphisms of Schubert varieties from folding the root system. This allows us to find an upper bound of the cardinality of isomorphism classes of Schubert three-folds.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The chiral algebra of 4D $\mathcal{N}=4$ SU$(N)$ super-Yang-Mills theory is an $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal vertex operator algebra. We analyse the structure of this algebra by studying recursively the constraints that are required by the associativity of the operator product expansion. We find that the algebra is uniquely characterized by the central charge (which can take an arbitrary value), without any additional free parameter. Furthermore, the truncation pattern of the OPE coefficients suggests that the algebra cannot arise from the symmetric orbifold.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $k\geq 2$, we give a detailed exposition of the superior $k$-highly composite numbers. We then consider the function $$f_k(n)=\frac{\log d_k(n)\log\log n}{\log k\log n},\quad n\geq 3$$ which has a maximum value $λ(k)$ at a superior $k$-highly composite number. We develop an efficient algorithm to compute $λ(k)$ and the positive integer $N_{\max}(k)$ where $f_k$ achieves the value $λ(k)$. The results for $2\leq k\leq 100$ are tabled.</p></details>
