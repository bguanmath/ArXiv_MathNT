 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ken Ono &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this note, we confirm a conjecture of Larson that arises in the Adams--Novikov spectral sequence (ANSS) for the stable homotopy groups of spheres and, specifically, in Behrens' program on explicit modular forms detecting $v_2$--periodic classes in the divided $\beta$-family. The conjecture predicts the supersingular order of the weight $12t$ form $L_2(\Delta^t)$, when $(p-1)\mid 12t,$ attached to the $\Gamma_0(2)$ Hecke correspondence. We prove the prediction for all primes $p\ge5$, thereby providing the precise modular input that calibrates the relevant ANSS differentials in the Behrens program and removes the last obstruction to using pure $\Delta$-power across the range of indices where Hodge-scaling cancels.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Terwilliger algebras are a subalgebra of a matrix algebra constructed from an association scheme. In 2010, Tanaka defined what it means for a Terwilliger algebra to be almost commutative and gave five equivalent conditions for a Terwilliger algebra to be almost commutative. In this paper we look at Terwilliger algebras coming from strong Gelfand pairs $(G,H)$ for a finite group $G$. From such a pair, one can create a Terwilliger algebra using the Schur ring of $H-$classes of elements of $G$. We determine all strong Gelfand pairs that give an Almost Commutative Terwilliger algebra.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** A. Grishkov, D. Logachev &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 9 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give in this paper a survey of results obtained in our earlier papers, and state explicitly some problems of further research, for example: are the analytic ranks bounded, or not? Twists of Carlitz modules are parametrized by polynomials over finite fields $\Bbb F_q$. The analytic rank of a twist is the order of zero of its L-function at a point. The set of polynomials of degree $\le m$ such that the analytic ranks of the corresponding twists are $\ge i$ is $X(m,i)(\Bbb F_q)$ where $X(m,i)$ is an affine variety defined over $\Bbb F_p$ (we do not know what is its dimension). We consider also a related invariant of a twist, namely, the behaviour of its L-function at infinity (the rank at infinity). We know much more on varieties corresponding to twists of a fixed rank at infinity and on their lifts from $\Bbb F_p$ to $\Bbb Z$ . For example, for $q=2$ the irreducible components of these varieties are described in terms of finite rooted weighted binary trees. A similar description for $q>2$ is not found yet.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** RaphaÃ«l Paegelow &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we study the decomposition into irreducible components of the fixed point locus under the action of $\Gamma$ a finite subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ of the smooth Nakajima quiver variety of the Jordan quiver. The quiver variety associated with the Jordan quiver is either isomorphic to the punctual Hilbert scheme in $\mathbb{C}^2$ or to the Calogero-Moser space. We describe the irreducible components using quiver varieties of McKay's quiver associated with the finite subgroup $\Gamma$ and we have given a general combinatorial model of the indexing set of these irreducible components in terms of certain elements of the root lattice of the affine Lie algebra associated with $\Gamma$. Finally, we prove that for every projective, symplectic resolution of a wreath product singularity, there exists an irreducible component of the fixed point locus of the punctual Hilbert scheme in the plane that is isomorphic to the resolution.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Terwilliger algebras are a subalgebra of a matrix algebra constructed from an association scheme. Rie Tanaka defined what it means for a Terwilliger algebra to be almost commutative and gave five equivalent conditions. In this paper we first determine an equivalent sixth condition for a Terwilliger algebra coming from a commutative Schur ring to be almost commutative. We then provide a classification of which finite groups result in an almost commutative Terwilliger algebra when looking at the group association scheme determined by the conjugacy classes. In particular, we show that all such groups are either abelian, or Camina groups. We then compute the dimension of each Terwilliger algebra, and we also express each of the group association schemes with an almost commutative Terwilliger algebra as a wreath product of the group schemes of finite abelian groups and $1-$class association schemes. Furthermore, we give the non-primary primitive idempotents for each Terwilliger algebra for those groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the function field analogue of Shanks bias. For Liouville function $\lambda(f)$, we compare the number of monic polynomials $f$ with $\lambda(f) \chi_m(f) = 1$ and $\lambda(f) \chi_m(f) = -1$ for a nontrivial quadratic character $\chi_m$ modulo a monic square-free polynomial $m$ over a finite field. Under Grand Simplicity Hypothesis (GSH) for $L$-functions, we prove that $\lambda \cdot \chi_m$ is biased towards $+1$. We also give some examples where GSH is violated.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06439v3'>2306.06439</a>\]&nbsp; **Universal families of twisted cotangent bundles**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Peter Crooks &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a complex algebraic group $G$ and complex $G$-variety $X$, one can study the affine Hamiltonian Lagrangian (AHL) $G$-bundles over $X$. Lisiecki indexes the isomorphism classes of such bundles in the case of a homogeneous $G$-variety $X=G/H$; the indexing set is the set of $H$-fixed points $(\mathfrak{h}^*)^H\subset\mathfrak{h}^*$, where $\mathfrak{h}$ is the Lie algebra of $H$. In very rough terms, one may regard $\psi\in(\mathfrak{h}^*)^H$ as labeling the isomorphism class of a $\psi$-twisted cotangent bundle of $G/H$. These twisted cotangent bundles feature prominently in geometric representation theory and symplectic geometry. We introduce and examine the notion of a universal family of AHL $G$-bundles over a $G$-variety $X$, as part of a broader program on Lie-theoretic and incidence-theoretic constructions of regular Poisson varieties. This family is defined to be a flat family $\pi:\mathcal{U}\longrightarrow Y$, in which $\mathcal{U}$ is a Poisson variety, the fibers of $\pi$ form a complete list of representatives of the isomorphism classes of AHL $G$-bundles over $X$, and other pertinent properties are satisfied. Our first main result is the construction of a universal family of AHL $G$-bundles over a homogeneous base $X=G/H$, for connected $H$. In our second main result, we take $X$ to be a conjugacy class $\mathcal{C}$ of self-normalizing closed subgroups of $G$. We associate to $\mathcal{C}$ a regular Poisson variety $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{C}}$, defined in incidence-theoretic terms. Attention is paid to the case of conjugacy classes of normalizers of symmetric subgroups. In the case of a connected semisimple group $G$ and conjugacy class $\mathcal{C}$ of parabolic subgroups, our third main result relates $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{C}}$ to the partial Grothendieck-Springer resolution for $\mathcal{C}$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16108v1'>2509.16108</a>\]&nbsp; **Geodesic clustering of zeros of Eisenstein series for congruence groups**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** SebastiÃ¡n Carrillo Santana, Gunther Cornelissen, Berend Ringeling &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 65 pages (a4paper, fullpaper), 15 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a set of generators for the space of Eisenstein series of even weight $k$ for any congruence group $\Gamma$ and study the set of all of their zeros taken for $\Gamma(1)$-conjugates of $\Gamma$ in the standard fundamental domain for $\Gamma(1)$. We describe (a) an upper bound $\kappa_\Gamma + O(1/k)$ for their imaginary part; (b) a finite configuration of geodesics segments to which all zeros converge in Hausdorff distance as $k \rightarrow \infty$; (c) a finite set containing all algebraic zeros for all weights. The bound in (a) depends on the (non-)vanishing of a new generalization of Ramanujan sums. The proof of (b) originates in a method used to study phase transitions in statistical physics. The proof of (c) relies on the theory of complex multiplication. The results can be made quantitative for specific groups. For $\Gamma=\Gamma(N)$ with $4 \nmid N$, $\kappa_\Gamma=1$ and the zeros tend to the unit circle, whereas if $4 \mid N$, $\kappa_\Gamma=2$ and the limit configuration includes parts of vertical geodesics and circles of radius $2$. In both cases, the only algebraic zeros are at $\mathrm{i}$ and $\exp(2\pi \mathrm{i}/3)$ for sufficiently large $k$. For $\Gamma(N)$ with $N$ odd, we use finer estimates to prove a trichotomy for the exact `convergence speed' of the zeros to the unit circle, as well as angular equidistribution of the zeros as $k \rightarrow \infty$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Barna Schefler, Kevin Zhao, Qinghai Zhong &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AC &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a finite group acting on a finite dimensional complex vector space $V$ via linear transformations. Let $\mathbb{C}[V]^G$ be the algebra of polynomials that are invariant under the induced $G$-action on the polynomial ring $\mathbb{C}[V]$. A subset $S\subseteq\mathbb{C}[V]^G$ is a separating set if it separates the orbits of the group action. If $G$ is abelian, then there exist finite separating sets consisting of monomials. In this paper we investigate properties of separating sets from four different points of view, including the monoid theoretical properties of separating sets consisting of monomials, the minimal size of separating sets consisting of monomials, the exact value of the separating Noether number $\sepbeta(G)$ of abelian groups of rank $4$, and the inverse problem of $\sepbeta(G)$ for abelian groups of rank $2$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 Pages, Comments Welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The structure groups and monoids of set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter Equation can be regarded as deformations of free abelian groups resp. monoids. In this work, we obtain explicit formulae for the growth series of the structure groups and monoids of transposition and dihedral quandles, and of the structure groups of permutation quandles. These quandles provide important families of YBE solutions. The intricate nature of our formulae confirms that, while preserving many nice properties of free abelian groups, even the simplest structure groups and monoids are remarkably rich objects. We also establish some structural properties and easily computable normal forms for the monoids considered.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nguyen Manh Linh &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 27 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the patching setting, given a factorization inverse system of fields over which patching for finite-dimensional vector spaces holds, together with a crossed module over the inverse limit field, the corresponding six-term Mayer--Vietoris sequence is constructed, generalizing the classical result of Harbater--Hartmann--Krashen for linear algebraic groups. When the crossed module is a two-term complex of tori, the above sequence is extended into a nine-term exact sequence, notably without any assumption on global domination of Galois cohomology of the inverse system. To this end, we develop a theory of (co-)flasque resolutions for short complexes of tori which is built on the work of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Sansuc. As an application, we show that patching holds for nonabelian second Galois cohomology of reductive groups with smooth centers. We also obtain a weak local--global principle for this cohomology set in the simply connected semisimple case.</p></details>

We investigate Brauer-Manin obstructions to weak approximation coming from the real places on such surfaces.</p></details>

For the case when the hyperplane section is geometrically the union of three lines and $k=\mathbb{Q}$, we give examples where the Galois invariant part descends to $\mathbb{Q}$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Josef Dick, Friedrich Pillichshammer &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The star discrepancy is a quantitative measure of the uniformity of a point set in the unit cube. A central quantity of interest is the inverse of the star discrepancy, $N(\varepsilon, s)$, defined as the minimum number of points required to achieve a star discrepancy of at most~$\varepsilon$ in dimension~$s$. It is known that $N(\varepsilon, s)$ depends only linearly on the dimension~$s$. All known proofs of this result are non-constructive. Finding explicit point set constructions that achieve this optimal linear dependence on the dimension remains a major open problem. In this paper, we make progress on this question by analyzing point sets constructed from a multiset union of digitally shifted Korobov polynomial lattice point sets. Specifically, we show the following two results. A union of randomly generated Korobov polynomial lattice point sets shifted by a random digital shift of depth $m$ can achieve a star discrepancy whose inverse depends only linearly on $s$. The second result shows that a union of all Korobov polynomial lattice point sets, each shifted by a different random digital shift, achieves the same star discrepancy bound. While our proof relies on a concentration result (Bennett's inequality) and is therefore non-constructive, it significantly reduces the search space for such point sets from a continuum of possibilities to a finite set of candidates, marking a step towards a fully explicit construction.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G \subset SL_3(\mathbb{C})$ be a finite abelian subgroup, and let $Y = G\mathrm{-}\mathrm{Hilb}(\mathbb{C}^3)$ be the corresponding $G$-Hilbert scheme. Denote by $\Psi: D^b_G(\mathrm{Coh}(\mathbb{C}^3)) \to D^b(\mathrm{Coh}(Y))$ the Bridgeland--King--Reid derived equivalence. For a nontrivial character $\chi$ of $G$, let $\chi^!$ be the corresponding skyscraper sheaf supported at the origin. It is known that $\Psi(\chi^!)$ is always a pure sheaf supported either in degree $0$ or in degree $-1$. We prove that the proportion of characters $\chi$ for which $\Psi(\chi^!)$ is supported in degree $0$ is a rational number lying between $0.25$ and $1$, with both bounds being sharp. Moreover, we exhibit families of resolutions for which these proportions attain certain explicit values within this range.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Starting from its original definition in module categories with respect to projective modules, the index has played an important role in various aspects of homological algebra, categorification of cluster algebras and $K$-theory. In the last few years, the notion of index has been generalised to several different contexts in (higher) homological algebra, typically with respect to a (higher) cluster-tilting subcategory $\mathcal{X}$ of the relevant ambient category $\mathcal{C}$. The recent tools of extriangulated and higher-exangulated categories have permitted some conditions on the subcategory $\mathcal{X}$ to be relaxed. In this paper, we introduce the index with respect to a generating, contravariantly finite subcategory of a $d$-exact category that has $d$-kernels. We show that our index has the important property of being additive on $d$-exact sequences up to an error term.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A field $F$ is a $\mathfrak{B}_s$-field if, for every finite extension $E'/E$ of $F$, the norm map $K_s^M(E')\to K_s^M(E)$ of the Milnor $K$-groups is surjective. In particular, finite fields ($s=1$), local fields, and certain global fields (with $s=2$) satisfy this condition. For such a field $F$ and a $d$-dimensional variety $X$ over $F$, we prove that $CH^{d+n}(X,n)$ is divisible for $n \geq s+1$, and $CH^{d+s}(X,s)$ is isomorphic to the direct sum of the Milnor $K$-group $K_{s}^M(F)$ and a divisible group. As an application, we study the Kato homology groups $KH_0^{(n)}(X,\mathbb{Z}/l^r\mathbb{Z})$ for any prime $l$ different from the characteristic of $F$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Dongfang Zhao &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical fiber product in algebraic geometry provides a powerful tool for studying loci where two morphisms to a base scheme, $\phi: X \to S$ and $\psi: Y \to S$, coincide exactly. This condition of strict equality, however, is insufficient for describing the geometric structure of semantic spaces in modern large language models, whose foundational architecture is the Transformer. The token spaces of these models are fundamentally arithmetic, and recent work has revealed complex geometric singularities, challenging the classical manifold hypothesis. This paper develops a new framework to study and quantify the nature of approximate alignment between morphisms in the context of arithmetic geometry, using the tools of \'etale homotopy theory. We introduce the central object of our work, the \'etale mismatch torsor, a sheaf of torsors over the product scheme $X \times_S Y$. The structure of this sheaf serves as a rich, intrinsic, and purely algebraic measure of the global relationship between the two morphisms. Our main theorem provides a complete classification of these structures, establishing a bijection between their isomorphism classes and the first \'etale cohomology group $H^1_{\text{\'et}}(X \times_S Y, \underline{\pi_1^{\text{\'et}}(S)})$. This result yields a discrete, algebraic invariant that replaces the non-intrinsic, metric-based notions of approximation first explored in applied contexts. We apply this framework to the concrete case of generalized Howe curves over finite fields to illustrate its connection to classical problems. This work introduces new homotopical invariants to arithmetic geometry, opening new avenues for the structural analysis of complex discrete systems.</p></details>

The numbers in this base are $$x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty {a(n)\over e^{\pi n}}$$ where $a(n)$ is taken from the OEIS catalog. These experiments were inspired by several facts. Indeed, it is known that the formula generating the partitions of integers is generated by an infinite product $$\prod_{k\ge1}^\infty {1\over 1-x^k} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty p(n)x^n$$ that when evaluated at $x=e^{-\pi}$ is equal to $${2^{3/8} \Gamma(3/4) \over \pi^{1/4} e^{\pi/24}}\ .\qquad\qquad (1)$$ By analyzing the 387500 sequences of the OEIS catalog, the model that was used is based on the fact that the infinite sum evaluated at $e^\pi$, is an expression that can be detected using a program like lindep from Pari-Gp. The process made it possible to find 793 expresssions similar to (1).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a complex reductive group, $\theta \colon G \to G$ an involution, and $K = G^\theta$. In arXiv:1206.5547, W. Schmid and the second named author proposed a program to study unitary representations of the corresponding real form $G_\mathbb{R}$ using $K$-equivariant twisted mixed Hodge modules on the flag variety of $G$ and their polarizations. In this paper, we make the first significant steps towards implementing this program. Our first main result gives an explicit combinatorial formula for the Hodge numbers appearing in the composition series of a standard module in terms of the Lusztig-Vogan polynomials. Our second main result is a polarized version of the Jantzen conjecture, stating that the Jantzen forms on the composition factors are polarizations of the underlying Hodge modules. Our third main result states that, for regular Beilinson-Bernstein data, the minimal $K$-type of an irreducible Harish-Chandra module lies in the lowest piece of the Hodge filtration of the corresponding Hodge module. An immediate consequence of our results is a Hodge-theoretic proof of the signature multiplicity formula of arXiv:1212.2192, which was the inspiration for this work.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Hodge filtrations of Schmid and Vilonen on unipotent representations of real reductive groups. We show that for various well-defined classes of unipotent representations (including, for example, the oscillator representations of metaplectic groups, the minimal representations of all simple groups, and all unipotent representations of complex groups) the Hodge filtration coincides with the quantization filtration predicted by the Orbit Method. We deduce a number of longstanding conjectures about such representations, including a proof that they are unitary and a description of their $K$-types in terms of co-adjoint orbits. The proofs rely heavily on certain good homological properties of the Hodge filtrations on weakly unipotent representations, which are established using a Hodge-theoretic upgrade of the Beilinson-Bernstein theory of intertwining functors for $\mathcal{D}$-modules on the flag variety. The latter consists of an action of the affine Hecke algebra on a category of filtered monodromic $\mathcal{D}$-modules, which we use to compare Hodge filtrations coming from different localizations of the same representation. As an application of the same methods, we also prove a new cohomology vanishing theorem for mixed Hodge modules on partial flag varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent papers [1,2], a new method to cross the natural boundary has been proposed, and applied to Mordell-Borel integrals arising in the study of Chern-Simons theory, based on decompositions into {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}. Resurgent analysis on the Stokes line leads to a unique transseries decomposition in terms of unary false theta functions, which can be continued across the natural boundary to produce dual $q$-series whose integer-valued coefficients enumerate BPS states. This constitutes a deeper new manifestation of resurgence in quantum field theoretic path integrals. In this paper we show that the algebraic structure of the {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}, combined with just the leading term of the $q$-series, completely determines the large order rate of growth of the dual $q$-series coefficients. The essential exponent of this asymptotic growth has a Cardy-like interpretation [10] of an effective central charge in a 3 dimensional quantum field theory with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry related to the Chern-Simons theory through the $3d$-$3d$ correspondence.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the asymptotic behavior of entropy polymatroids associated with algebraic matroids over finite fields. Given an algebraic matroid ${\sf M}:=(\mathcal{E},r)$ and the irreducible variety $V$ associated with ${\sf M}$, we consider the polymatroid $h_{\mathbb{F}}$ induced by the entropies of the projections of $V(\mathbb{F})$, where $\mathbb{F}$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb{G}$. Revisiting a construction of Mat\'u$\check{\mathrm{s}}$, we show that the polymatroid $h_{\mathbb{F}}$ converges to the rank function $r$ of ${\sf M}$ as $q:=|\mathbb{F}|$ tends to infinity. Our main contribution is to make this convergence quantitative: we derive explicit uniform error bounds for the deviation $|h_\mathbb{F}-r|$, expressed in terms of the degree of $V$, the ground set size $|\mathcal{E}|$, the rank $r(\mathcal{E})$, and $q$. The proofs combine tools of algebraic geometry (effective Lang-Weil estimates and intrinsic degree bounds for annihilating polynomials of circuits) with information-theoretic arguments (submodularity of entropy and conditional entropy estimates). These results provide the first effective and uniform approximation bounds for algebraic matroids by entropy polymatroids, clarifying the quantitative link between algebraic independence (captured by matroid rank) and information-theoretic independence (captured by entropy).</p></details>

These objects capture the combinatorics of the graphs $G(p,\ell,H)$, the $\ell$-isogeny graphs of supersingular elliptic curves with $H$-level structure. In particular they allow for the study of non-backtracking walks, primes, and zeta functions. We prove an analogue of Ihara's determinant formula for the zeta function of an abstract isogeny graph. For $B_1(N) \subseteq H \subseteq B_0(N)$ and $p > 3$, we use this formula to relate the Ihara zeta function of $G(p,\ell,H)$ to the Hasse-Weil zeta functions of the modular curves $X_{H, {\mathbb{F}_{\ell}}}$ and $X_{H \times B_0(p), \mathbb{F}_{\ell}}$. As applications, we give an explicit formula relating point counts on $X_0(pN)_{\mathbb{F}_{\ell}}$ and $X_0(N)_{\mathbb{F}_{\ell}}$ to cycle counts in $G(p,\ell,B_0(N))$ and prove that the number of non-backtracking cycles of length $r$ in $G(p,\ell,B_0(N))$ is asymptotic to $\ell^r$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the finite field $k := \mathbb Z_2$ and $G(q)$ be the general linear group of rank $q$ over $k.$ A well-known open problem in algebraic topology is the explicit determination of the cohomology groups of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}^{q, *}_A(k, k),$ for all homological degrees $q \geq 0.$ The Singer algebraic transfer of rank $q,$ formulated by William Singer in 1989, serves as a valuable method for the description of such Ext groups. This transfer maps from the coinvariants of a certain representation of $G(q)$ to ${\rm Ext}^{q, *}_A(k, k).$ Singer predicted that the algebraic transfer is always injective, but this has gone unanswered for all $q\geq 4.$ This paper establishes Singer's conjecture for rank four in the generic degrees $n = 2^{s+t+1} +2^{s+1} - 3$ whenever $t\neq 3$ and $s\geq 1,$ and $n = 2^{s+t} + 2^{s} - 2$ whenever $t\neq 2,\, 3,\, 4$ and $s\geq 1.$ In conjunction with our previous results, this completes the proof of the Singer conjecture for rank four. All the obtained results can be verified directly by using the program suite of our novel algorithms presented in [17, 18, 19, 20]. We note that although Singer's conjecture still holds for the case of rank 4, it no longer holds for rank 6, as announced in our most recent work [20].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a field $L$ of characteristic $p$, a polynomial $f \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p[x]$ and $\alpha, \beta \in L$, let $\mathrm{Prep}(f;\alpha,\beta)$ be the set of all $\lambda \in \overline{L}$ such that both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are preperiodic under the action of $f_{\lambda}(x) := f(x) + \lambda$. Ghioca and Hsia proved that for certain families of polynomials, this set is infinite if and only if $f(\alpha)=f(\beta)$ or $\alpha, \beta \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$. Building on their earlier work, we determine the condition that $\mathrm{Prep}(f;\alpha,\beta)$ is infinite for two classes of binomials that were left open. Specifically, let $f(x)=c_1 x^{d_1} + c_2 x^{d_2} \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p[x]$, where $c_i \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p^*$, $1 \le d_1 < d_2$ and $d_i=p^{\ell_i}s_i$ with $\ell_i \ge 0$ and $p \nmid s_i$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We revisit the effective Erdos-Wintner theorem for Zeckendorf expansions. Drmota and the author obtained a uniform Kolmogorov bound whose error involves $T\sum_{j>L-2h}|f(F_j)|$, which assumes absolute convergence of the linear tail $\sum_j f(F_j)$. We remove this assumption. Grouping the transfer matrices in pairs and working to second order on the logarithm of the product, after extracting the common linear phase along the dominant direction, yields a quadratic tail $T^2\sum_{j>L-2h} f(F_j)^2$, or, in a flexible variant, the split tail $T\sum_{|f(F_j)|>1/T}|f(F_j)| + T^2\sum_{|f(F_j)|\le 1/T} f(F_j)^2$. Either form requires only $\sum f(F_j)^2<\infty$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A maximal curve over a finite field $\mathbb F_q$ is a curve whose number of points reaches the upper Hasse-Weil-Serre bound. We define the discriminant of $\mathbb F_q$ as $d(\mathbb F_q):= \lfloor2\sqrt{q}\rfloor^2-4q$, which arises as the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius for a maximal elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb F_q$. In this article we investigate the existence of a maximal curve of genus $5$ defined over a finite field $\mathbb F_q$ of discriminant $-19$. Using the knowledge on the automorphism group of such a curve, we prove that such curve does not exist when $q\equiv 2,3,4 \mod 5$. In the case $q\equiv 1\mod 5$ we give models of the potential maximal curve. Finally, for the case $q\equiv 0\bmod 5$, we prove that such a curve might exist only for $q=5^7$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A well-known result by Larson and Sweedler shows that integrals on a Hopf algebra can be obtained by applying the Structure Theorem for Hopf modules to the rational part of its linear dual. This fact can be rephrased by saying that taking the space of integrals comes from a right adjoint functor from a category of modules to the category of vector spaces. This observation inspired the categorical approach that we advocate in this work, which yields to a new notion of integrals for bialgebras in the linear setting. Despite the novelty of the construction, it returns the classical definition in the presence of an antipode. We test this new concept on bialgebras that satisfy at least one of the following properties: being coseparable as regular module coalgebras, having a one-sided antipode, being commutative, being cocommutative, or being finite-dimensional. One of the main results we obtain in this process is a dual Maschke-type theorem relating coseparability and total integrals. Remarkably, there are cases in which the space of integrals turns out to be isomorphic to that of the associated Hopf envelope. In particular, this space results to be one-dimensional for finite-dimensional bialgebras, providing an existence and uniqueness theorem for integrals in the finite-dimensional case. Furthermore, explicit computations are given for concrete examples including the polynomial bialgebra with one group-like variable, the quantum plane and the coordinate bialgebra of $n$-by-$n$ matrices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let \( E \) be a complex elliptic curve with conductor \( N \) and modular invariant \( j(E) \in \mathbb{Q} \). We construct a class of modular polynomials $F_N(x,j)$ that relate the modular function $x$ on $X_0(N)$ to the $j$-invariant $j$, where $x$ is obtained by composing the first coordinate function of $E$ with the modular parametrization $\varphi: X_0(N) \rightarrow E$. Using $F_N(x,j)$, we can precisely determine the poles of $\varphi$, compute exact values of $\varphi$ at cusps, and develop an algorithm for calculating ramification points of $\varphi$. Moreover, $F_N(x,j)$ yields an efficient algorithm for computing the fibres of $\varphi$ over arbitrary points on $E$. In some sense, $F_N(x,j)$ also provides a ``total" formula for computing the minimal polynomial of the images of Heegner points on $X_0(N)$ under $\varphi$. Especially, we compute the semi-trace of the image $\varphi ([\frac{{ - 1 + \sqrt { - 3} }}{2}])$ of the CM-point $[\frac{-1 + \sqrt{-3}}{2}]$ on $X_{0}(389)$, under the action of a 65-element subgroup of the 260-element Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3}, j(389 \cdot \frac{-1 + \sqrt{-3}}{2}))$. Finally, we associate a point of infinite order in~\( E(\mathbb{Q}) \) with an infinite sequence~$\{ (j(\tau_n), j(N\tau_n)) \}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}^+} $ of algebraic numbers whose degrees are bounded by the degree of~$\varphi$. This provides one seemingly practicable approach to addressing the BSD conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a prime $p$, the $p$-adic Littlewood Conjecture stands as a well-known arithmetic variant of the celebrated Littlewood Conjecture in Diophantine Approximation. In the same way as the latter, it admits a natural function field analogue depending on the choice of an irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ with coefficients in a field $\mathbb{K}$. This analogue is referred to as the $P(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture ($P(t)$-LC for short). $P(t)$-LC is proved to fail for any choice of irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ over any ground field $\mathbb{K}$ with characteristic $ \ell \equiv 3\pmod{4}$. The counterexample refuting it is shown to present a local arithmetic obstruction emerging from the fact that -1 is not a quadratic residue modulo a prime $\ell\equiv 3\pmod{4}$. The theory developed elucidates and generalises all previous approaches towards refuting the conjecture. They were all based on the computer-assisted method initiated by Adiceam, Nesharim and Lunnon (2021) which has been able to establish that $P(t)$-LC fails in some small characteristics (essentially up to 11). This computer-assisted method is, however, unable to provide a general statement as it relies on ad hoc computer verifications which, provided they terminate, refute $P(t)$--LC in a given characteristic. This limitation is overcome by exhibiting an arithmetic obstruction to the validity of $P(t)$--LC in infinitely many characteristics. The existence of arithmetic obstructions within the context of $P(t)$--LC leaves the remaining case of odd characteristics $ \ell\equiv 1\pmod{4}$ dependent on their determination. This is shown to hold in an effective and explicit way.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any block of a finite group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $2$ which has dihedral, semidihedral, or generalized quaternion defect groups, we determine explicitly the decomposition of the associated diagonal $p$-permutation functor over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $0$ into a direct sum of simple functors. As a consequence we see that two blocks with dihedral, semidihedral, or generalized quaternion defect groups are functorially equivalent over $\mathbb{F}$ if and only if their fusion systems are isomorphic. It is an open question if two blocks (with arbitrary defect groups) that are functorially equivalent over $\mathbb{F}$ must have isomorphic fusion systems.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by the 1920's seminal work of Major MacMahon, Amdeberhan--Andrews--Tauraso recently introduced an infinite family of $q$-series $$ \mathcal{U}_{t}(a;q):= \sum_{1\le n_1<n_2<\cdots<n_t} \frac{q^{n_1+n_2+\cdots+n_t}}{(1+aq^{n_1}+q^{2n_1})(1+aq^{n_2}+q^{2n_2})\cdots (1+aq^{n_t}+q^{2n_t})} $$ and proved that these functions are linear combinations of quasimodular forms. In this paper, we study a broader family of $q$-series that contains the collection $\{\mathcal{U}_t\}_{t \in \mathbb{N}}$. Using the theory of quasi shuffle algebras, we show that this extended family also lies in the algebra of quasimodular forms. Moreover, we determine the precise weights and levels of these functions, thereby making Amdeberhan--Andrews--Tauraso's result sharp. We further investigate the limiting behavior of these functions. In particular, we demonstrate that the sequence of quasimodular forms~$\{\mathcal{U}_t(1;q)\}_{t\in\mathbb{N}}$ gives an approximation for the ordinary partition function. We also establish infinitely many closed formulas for reciprocals of certain infinite products in terms of~$\mathcal{U}_{t}(a;q)$.</p></details>

This result is a homotopy version of the lax functoriality of center of an algebra obtained by Davydov, Kong, Runkel, Grady, Oren, et al, in the more general context of dg categories, and extends the restricted functoriality of Hochschild cochain complex of a dg category obtained by Keller to global lax functoriality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Machine learning explorations can make significant inroads into solving difficult problems in pure mathematics. One advantage of this approach is that mathematical datasets do not suffer from noise, but a challenge is the amount of data required to train these models and that this data can be computationally expensive to generate. Key challenges further comprise difficulty in a posteriori interpretation of statistical models and the implementation of deep and abstract mathematical problems. We propose a method for scalable tasks, by which models trained on simpler versions of a task can then generalize to the full task. Specifically, we demonstrate that a transformer neural-network trained on predicting permutations from words formed by general transpositions in the symmetric group $S_{10}$ can generalize to the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with near 100\% accuracy. We also show that $S_{10}$ generalizes to $S_{16}$ with similar performance if we only use adjacent transpositions. We employ identity augmentation as a key tool to manage variable word lengths, and partitioned windows for training on adjacent transpositions. Finally we compare variations of the method used and discuss potential challenges with extending the method to other tasks.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In \cite{Broer1993}, it was shown that certain line bundles on $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}}=T^*G/B$ have vanishing higher cohomology. We prove a generalization of this theorem for real reductive groups in the case when $G$ is adjoint. More specifically, if $\mathcal{N}_\theta$ denotes the cone of nilpotent elements in a Cartan subspace $\mathfrak{p},$ we have a similar construction of a resolution of singularities $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}.$ We prove that for a certain cone of weights $H^i(\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta},\mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}}(\lambda))=0$ for $i> 0.$ This follows by combining a simple calculation of the canonical bundle for $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}$ with Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing. We use this to show that for groups of QCT (Definition 2), $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{N}_\theta]$ is equivalent as a $K$-representation to a certain cohomologically induced module giving a new proof of a result in \cite{KostantRallis1971}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the set ${\mathscr S}_Q$ of Farey fractions $d/b$ of order $Q$ with the property that there exists a matrix $\left( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix} \right) \in \mathrm{SL}(2,{\mathbb Z})$ of trace at most $Q$, with positive entries and $a\ge \max\{ b,c\}$. For every $Q\ge 3$, the set ${\mathscr S}_Q \cup \{ 0\}$ is shown to define a unimodular partition of the interval $[0,1]$. We also prove that the elements of ${\mathscr S}_Q$ are asymptotically distributed with respect to the probability measure with density $(1/(1+x) -1/(2+x) )/\log (4/3) $ and that the sequence of sets $({\mathscr S}_Q)_Q$ has a limiting gap distribution as $Q\rightarrow \infty$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer $x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$ for $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps $x\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In particular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$. This seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the conjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any correspondence between polynomials and positive integers. In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend their domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that correspond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power series. We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\colon F_2[[q]]\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$ otherwise, where $A,B\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some of these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive integers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that $T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the orbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two fixed points. Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these conjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by replacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic integer. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could settle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for both $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The demand to know the structure of functionally independent invariants of tensor fields arises in many problems of theoretical and mathematical physics, for instance for the construction of interacting higher-order tensor field actions. In mathematical terms the problem can be formulated as follows. Given a semi-simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ and a $\mathfrak g$-module $V$, one may ask about the structure of the sub-ring of $\mathfrak g$-invariants inside the ring freely generated by the module. We point out how some information about the ring of invariants may be obtained by studying an extended Lie algebra. Numerous examples are given, with particular focus on the difficult problem of classifying invariants of a self-dual 5-form in 10 dimensions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a generalisation of vector fields on a vector space, where the vector space is generalised to a highest-weight module over a Kac-Moody algebra. The generalised vector field is an element in a non-associative superalgebra defined by the module and the Kac-Moody algebra. Also the Lie derivative of a vector field parameterised by another is generalised and expressed in a simple way in terms of this superalgebra. It reproduces the generalised Lie derivative in the general framework of extended geometry, which in special cases reduces to the one in exceptional field theory, unifying diffeomorphisms with gauge transformations in supergravity theories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1959, Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres posed a series of problems concerning the size of polynomials of the form $$ P_n(z) = \prod_{j=1}^n (1 - z^{s_j}), $$ where $s_1, \dots, s_n$ are positive integers. Of particular interest is the quantity $$ f(n) = \inf_{s_1,\dots,s_n\ge 1} \max_{|z|=1} |P_n(z)|. $$They proved that $\lim_{n\to\infty} f(n)^{1/n} = 1$, and also established the classical lower bound $f(n) \ge \sqrt{2n}$. However, despite extensive effort over more than six decades, no stronger general lower bound had been established. In this paper, we obtain the new bound $$ f(n) \ge 2\sqrt{n}. $$This gives the first improvement of the classical lower bound for the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres problem in the general case since 1959.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical notion of splitting a binary quadratic operad $\mathcal{P}$ gives the notion of pre-$\mathcal{P}$-algebras characterized by $\mathcal{O}$-operators, with pre-Lie algebras as a well-known example. Pre-$\mathcal{P}$-algebras give a refinement of the structure of $\mathcal{P}$-algebras and is critical in the Manin triple approach to bialgebras for $\mathcal{P}$-algebras. Motivated by the new types of splitting appeared in recent studies, this paper aims to extend the classical notion of splitting, by relaxing the requirement that the adjoint actions of the pre-$\mathcal{P}$-algebra form a representation of the $\mathcal{P}$-algebra, to allow also linear combinations of the adjoint actions to form a representation. This yields a whole family of type-$M$ pre-structures, parameterized by the coefficient matrix $M$ of the linear combinations. Using the duals of the adjoint actions gives another family of splittings. Similar generalizations are given to the $\mathcal{O}$-operator characterization of the splitting, and to certain conditions on bilinear forms. Furthermore, this general framework is applied to determine the bialgebra structure induced from averaging Lie bialgebras, lifting the well-known fact that an averaging Lie algebra induces a Leibniz algebra to the level of bialgebras. This is achieved by interpreting the desired bialgebra structure for the Leibniz algebra as the one for a special type-$M$ pre-Leibniz algebra for a suitably chosen matrix $M$ in the above family.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 36 pages, v2: examples added in Section 6.1, to be published in the special issue of Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics in honor of Vyjayanthi Chari, v3: minor edits

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The deformation approach of arXiv:2104.07816 for computing zeta functions of one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds is generalised to cover also multiparameter manifolds. Consideration of the multiparameter case requires the development of an improved formalism. This allows us, among other things, to make progress on some issues left open in previous work, such as the treatment of apparent and conifold singularities and changes of coordinates. We also discuss the efficient numerical computation of the zeta functions. As examples, we compute the zeta functions of the two-parameter mirror octic, a non-symmetric split of the quintic threefold also with two parameters, and the $S_5$ symmetric five-parameter Hulek-Verrill manifolds. These examples allow us to exhibit the several new types of geometries for which our methods make practical computations possible. They also act as consistency checks, as our results reproduce and extend those of arXiv:hep-th/0409202 and arXiv:math/0304169. To make the methods developed here more approachable, a Mathematica package "CY3Zeta" for computing the zeta functions of Calabi-Yau threefolds, which is attached to this paper, is presented.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{P}_k(\delta)$, where $k$ is a positive integer and $\delta$ some complex parameter, be the classical partition algebra over the complex numbers. In the case when $\delta=n$, it is well-known that the algebra $\mathcal{P}_k(\delta)$ is the centralizer of the symmetric group $S_n$ acting on the $k$-fold tensor space of the natural representation of $S_n$, for $n\geq 2k$. The algebra $\mathcal{P}_k(\delta)$ is semi-simple for generic values of $\delta$. In this paper, we show that semi-simple partition algebras appear as the centralizer algebras for certain representations of the rook monoids given by an iterative restriction-induction of the trivial representation. Along the way, we also give a decomposition of this iterative representation of the rook monoid into various tensor spaces and show that the corresponding dimensions are given by generalized Bell numbers.</p></details>

In this work, we give combinatorial interpretations of two subclasses of these determinants in terms of domino tilings and nonintersecting lattice paths, thereby partially answering a question of theirs. Furthermore, the determinant evaluations established by Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser produce many product formulas for our weighted enumerations of domino tilings and nonintersecting lattice paths. However, there are still two enumerations left corresponding to conjectural formulas made by the three. We hereby prove the two conjectures using the principle of holonomic Ansatz plus the approach of modular reduction for creative telescoping, and hence fill the gap.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a Bridgeland stability condition on a 2-Calabi--Yau category, we define a simplicial complex that encodes the Harder--Narasimhan filtrations of spherical objects. For 2-Calabi--Yau categories of type A, we relate this complex to the complex of pointed pseudo-triangulations on configurations of points on the plane. Using this connection, we prove that the complex undergoes piecewise-linear wall-crossings as we vary the stability condition, and is piecewise-linearly homeomorphic to a sphere. Additionally, we prove that for a generic stability condition on a 2-Calabi--Yau category, a spherical object is determined by the ordered list of its Harder--Narasimhan factors.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a theory of Euler and Kolyvagin systems relative to the Nekov\'{a}\v{r}-Selmer complexes of $p$-adic representations over local complete Gorenstein rings. This is simultaneously finer, and requires weaker hypotheses, than the theory of Kolyvagin systems developed by Mazur and Rubin over discrete valuation rings and then by Sakamoto, Sano and the second author over Gorenstein rings. To illustrate its advantages, we prove new cases of Kato's generalised Iwasawa main conjecture for $\mathbb{Z}_p(1)$ and the $p$-adic Tate modules of rational elliptic curves, as well as of the Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjecture, and we also strengthen existing results on the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for CM elliptic curves.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we define a Grothendieck ring as a fusion ring categorifiable into a fusion category over the complex field. An integral fusion ring is called Drinfeld if all its formal codegrees are integers dividing the global Frobenius--Perron dimension. Every integral Grothendieck ring is necessarily Drinfeld. Using the fact that the formal codegrees of integral Drinfeld rings form an Egyptian fraction summing to 1, we derive a finite list of possible global FPdims for small ranks. Applying Normaliz, we classify all fusion rings with these candidate FPdims, retaining only those admitting a Drinfeld structure. To exclude Drinfeld rings that are not Grothendieck rings, we analyze induction matrices to the Drinfeld center, classified via our new Normaliz feature. Further exclusions and constructions involve group-theoretical fusion categories and Schur multipliers. Our main result is a complete classification of integral Grothendieck rings up to rank 5, extended to rank 7 in odd-dimensional and noncommutative cases using Frobenius--Schur indicators and Galois theory. Moreover, we show that any noncommutative, odd-dimensional, integral Grothendieck ring of rank at most 22 is pointed of rank 21. We also classify all integral 1-Frobenius Drinfeld rings of rank 6, identify the first known non-Isaacs integral fusion category (which turns out to be group-theoretical), classify integral noncommutative Drinfeld rings of rank 8, and integral 1-Frobenius MNSD Drinfeld rings of rank 9. Finally, we determine the smallest-rank exotic simple integral fusion rings: rank 4 in general, rank 6 in the Drinfeld case, and rank 7 in the 1-Frobenius Drinfeld case.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 57 pages, final version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study isolated quotient singularities by finite and linearly reductive group schemes (lrq singularities for short) and show that they satisfy many, but not all, of the known properties of finite quotient singularities in characteristic zero: (1) From the lrq singularity we can recover the group scheme and the quotient presentation. (2) We establish canonical lifts to characteristic zero, which leads to a bijection between lrq singularities and certain characteristic zero counterparts. (3) We classify subgroup schemes of ${\mathbf{GL}}_d$ and ${\mathbf{SL}}_d$ that correspond to lrq singularities. For $d=2$, this generalises results of Klein, Brieskorn, and Hashimoto. Also, our classification is closely related to the spherical space form problem. (4) F-regular (resp. F-regular and Gorenstein) surface singularities are precisely the lrq singularities by finite and linearly reductive subgroup schemes of ${\mathbf{GL}}_2$ (resp. ${\mathbf{SL}}_2$). This generalises results of Klein and Du Val. (5) Lrq singularities in dimension $\geq 4$ are infinitesimally rigid. We classify lrq singularities in dimension $3$ that are not infinitesimally rigid and compute their deformation spaces. This generalises Schlessinger's rigidity theorem to positive and mixed characteristic. Finally, we study Riemenschneider's conjecture in this context, that is, whether lrq singularities deform to lrq singularities.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the cohomology ring $H^*(U,\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$ for $U=X\setminus S$ where $X$ is the spectrum of the ring of integers of a number field $K$ and $S$ is a finite set of finite primes. As a consequence, we obtain an efficient way to compute presentations of $Q_2(G_S)$, where $G_S$ is Galois group of the maximal extension of $K$ unramified outside of a finite set of primes $S$, for varying $K$. This includes the following cases (for $p$ any prime dividing $n$): $\mu_p(\overline{K}) \not\subseteq K$; $S$ does not contain the primes above $p$; and $p=2$ with $K$ admitting real archimedean places. We also show how to recover the classical reciprocity law of the Legendre symbol from the graded commutativity of the cup product.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the effect of a quantum Frobenius twist on Ext-groups in the category of quantum polynomial functors. We use quantum versions of the de Rham and Koszul complexes, and compute their homologies. We use them to do several Ext-computations, and obtain a formula to compute Ext-groups between two functors obtained via the Frobenius, in characteristic zero or in big enough characteristic. Finally, we make some advancements toward a general formula in arbitrary characteristic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The distribution of the properly renormalized gaps of $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ with $n < N$ converges (when $N\rightarrow \infty$) to a non-standard limit distribution, as Elkies and McMullen proved in 2004 using techniques from homogeneous dynamics. In this paper we give an essentially self-contained proof based on the circle method. Our main innovation consists in showing that a new type of correlation functions of $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ converge. To define these correlation functions we restrict, smoothly, to those $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ that lie in minor arcs, i.e. away from rational numbers with small denominators.</p></details>
