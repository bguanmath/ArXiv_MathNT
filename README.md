 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Victor V. Albert, Eric Kubischta, Mikhail Lemeshko, Lee R. Liu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** quant-ph &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We formulate a quantum phase space for rotational and nuclear-spin states of rigid molecules. For each nuclear spin isomer, we re-derive the isomer's admissible angular momentum states from molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, introduce its angular position states using quantization theory, and develop a generalized Fourier transform converting between the two. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We discuss two general features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, we quantify when and how an isomer's state space is completely rotation-spin entangled, meaning that it does not admit any separable states. Second, we identify isomers whose position states house an internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline how the fiber can be used as a quantum error-correcting code and discuss scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed</p></details>

> **Comment:** 72 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the specializations $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}^ε$ at roots of unity $ε$ of odd order of the graph algebras, associated to a simply-connected complex semi-simple algebraic group $G$ and a compact oriented surface $Σ_{g,n}^{\circ}$ with genus $g$, $n$ punctures, and one boundary component. We prove that the central localizations of $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}^ε$ and of its subalgebra $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}^{u_ε}$ of invariant elements under the coadjoint action of a small quantum group, are central simple algebras of PI degrees that we compute. Also, we describe their centers, and show they are integrally closed rings.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Matthew Stover &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** To appear in IMRN

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A Fuchsian group $Γ$ has a modular embedding if its adjoint trace field is a totally real number field and every unbounded Galois conjugate $Γ^σ$ comes equipped with a holomorphic (or conjugate holomorphic) map ${φ^σ: \mathbb{B}^1 \to \mathbb{B}^1}$ intertwining the actions of $Γ$ and $Γ^σ$ on the Poincaré disk $\mathbb{B}^1$. This paper provides the first cocompact nonarithmetic Fuchsian groups with a modular embedding that are not commensurable with a triangle group. The main result, proved using period domains, is that any immersed totally geodesic complex curve on a complex hyperbolic $2$-orbifold has a modular embedding. Another consequence is arithmeticity of totally geodesic curves on finite-volume complex hyperbolic surfaces that are commensurable with quotients of $\mathbb{B}^1$ by the group generated by reflections in quadrilaterals satisfying certain angle conditions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Christian Bernert, Ulrich Derenthal, Judith Ortmann, Florian Wilsch &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 20 pages, 5 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an asymptotic formula for the number of integral points of bounded log anticanonical height on a singular quartic del Pezzo surface over arbitrary number fields, with respect to the largest admissible boundary divisor. The resulting Clemens complex is more complicated than usual, and leads to particularly interesting effective cone constants, associated with exponentially many polytopes whose volumes appear in the expected formula. Like a jigsaw puzzle, these polytopes fit together to one large polytope. The volume of this polytope appears in the asymptotic formula that we obtain using the universal torsor method via o-minimal structures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Following the work of Mestre, we use Weil's explicit formulas to compute explicit lower bounds on the conductors of elliptic curves and abelian varieties over number fields. Moreover, we obtain bounds for the conductor of elliptic curves and abelian varieties over $\mathbb{Q}$ with specified bad reduction and over number fields. As an application, for specific fields, we prove the non-existence of abelian varieties with everywhere good reduction.</p></details>

Published version, to appear in Annals of Probability

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove dynamical local limits for the singular numbers of $p$-adic random matrix products at both the bulk and edge. The limit object which we construct, the reflecting Poisson sea, may thus be viewed as a $p$-adic analogue of line ensembles appearing in classical random matrix theory. However, in contrast to those it is a discrete space Poisson-type particle system with only local reflection interactions and no obvious determinantal structure. The limits hold for any $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)$-invariant matrix distributions under weak universality hypotheses, with no spatial rescaling.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jiahe Shen, Roger Van Peski &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** v1: 30 pages. Comments welcome! v2: minor revisions in response to referee comments, appears in IMRN

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We relate the combinatorics of Hall-Littlewood polynomials to that of abelian $p$-groups with alternating or Hermitian perfect pairings. Our main result is an analogue of the classical relationship between the Hall algebra of abelian $p$-groups (without pairings) and Hall-Littlewood polynomials. Specifically, we define a module over the classical Hall algebra with basis indexed by groups with pairings, and explicitly relate its structure constants to Hall-Littlewood polynomials at different values of the parameter $t$. We also show certain expectation formulas with respect to Cohen-Lenstra type measures on groups with pairings. In the alternating case this gives a new and simpler proof of previous results of Delaunay-Jouhet.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Our primary concern is the computational complexity of algorithms that find all Carmichael numbers less than some specified bound $B$. We have three related results. First, we show CARMICHAELS is in $\textbf{P}$, where only the run-time is conditioned on the ERH. Second, we state a heuristically optimal tabulation algorithm, which is the first asymptotic improvement to tabulation algorithms in the $50$ years since Swift first described the prime-by-prime approach. Third, we implemented a related algorithm that tabulated $100$ times further while only doing about $5$ times the work of the prior tabulation. We found $308,279,939$ Carmichael numbers less than $10^{24}$ and we provide some statistics on these numbers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** To appear in the Proceedings of the ICM 2026; typos corrected

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We survey three settings in which dimensions of intersection cohomology groups of algebraic varieties provide deep combinatorial and representation-theoretic information, and computations of the groups themselves have been made using combinatorial sheaves on finite posets. These settings are (1) intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and their realizations via moment graph sheaves and Soergel bimodules; (2) intersection cohomology of toric varieties, the associated g-polynomials of convex polytopes, and their realization via the theory of intersection cohomology of fans; and (3) intersection cohomology of arrangement Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of matroids, and their realization via intersection cohomology of matroids. In all three settings these constructions are valid in more general situations where the variety does not exist, leading to "intersection cohomology without spaces." We give parallel presentations of these three stories, highlighting applications to KLS-polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We extend a conjugacy Theorem of Cartan subalgebras, originally established for symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras, to the broader context of affine Kac-Moody superalgebras. Along the way, we obtain several results that deepen our understanding of the structure of affine Kac-Moody superalgebras. Additionally, we achieve findings regarding the relations within the imaginary root spaces of symmetrizable affine Kac-Moody superalgebras, providing new insights into their algebraic properties.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08612v1'>2601.08612</a>\]&nbsp; **On the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-property for Selmer groups at supersingular reduction**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sören Kleine, Ahmed Matar, Sujatha Ramdorai &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 101 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ which has good supersingular reduction at the odd prime $p$. We study the variation of Iwasawa invariants and the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-property for signed Selmer groups over $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of an imaginary quadratic number field $K$ that lie inside the $\mathbb{Z}_p^2$-extension $\mathbb{K}_\infty$ of $K$ and are not necessarily cyclotomic. We prove several equivalent criteria for the validity of the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-property which involve the growth of $μ$-invariants of the signed Selmer groups over intermediate shifted $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions in $\mathbb{K}_\infty$, and the boundedness of $λ$-invariants as one runs over $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of $K$ inside $\mathbb{K}_\infty$. We give examples where the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-property holds, and also examples where we can prove that it does not hold. It is striking that although the case of supersingular reduction is much more difficult than the case of ordinary reduction, we get finer results here; moreover, we are able to derive analogous criteria for the validity of the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-property of the classical Selmer group, as well as the fine Selmer group. Many of the properties that we investigate have not been studied before in this non-torsion setting. Further, we study various implications between the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-properties for Selmer groups, signed Selmer groups and fine Selmer groups. We apply our results to a conjecture of Mazur, and prove implications between the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-property and Conjectures A and B of Coates and Sujatha.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 24 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:math/0610368 by other authors

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\Cr_\Q(2)$ be the Cremona group of rank $2$ over rational numbers. we give a classification of large finite subgroups $G$ of $\Cr_\Q(2)$ and give a new sharp bound smaller (but not multiplicative) than $M(\Q)=120960 = 2^7\cdot3^3\cdot5\cdot7$; the one given in \cite{MR2567402}. In particular, we prove that any finite subgroup $G \subset\Cr_\Q(2)$ has order $\mid G\mid \le 432$ and Lemma \ref{lemm-17} provides a group of order $432$. We use the modern approach of minimal $G-$surfaces, given a (smooth) rational surface $S\subset\p^2$ defined over $\Q$, we study the finite subgroups $G \subset \Aut_{\Q}(S)$ of automorphisms of $S$. We give the best bound for the order of $G\subset\Aut(S)$ for surfaces with a conic bundle structure invariant by $G$. We also give the best bound for the order of $G\subset \Aut_\Q(S)$ for all rational Del Pezzo surfaces of some given degree. In addition, we give descriptions of the finite subgroups of automorphisms of conic bundles and Del Pezzo surfaces of maximal size.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Pankaj Patel, Debopam Chakraborty, Jaitra Chattopadhyay &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we consider two infinite parametric families of elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ given by the equations $E_{a,b} : y^{2} = x^{3} - a^{2}x + b^{2}$ and $E^{\prime}_{a,b} : y^{2} = x^{3} - a^{2}x + b^{6}$, where $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$ satisfy certain mild conditions. We prove that the torsion group of $E_{a,b}(\mathbb{Q})$ is trivial and the Mordell-Weil ranks of both $E_{a,b}(\mathbb{Q})$ and $E^{\prime}_{a,b}(\mathbb{Q})$ are at least $3$ for infinitely many choices of $a$ and $b$ by using the Néron-Tate height of a rational point and by exploiting the unit group of the ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$. This is an extension of the results of Brown-Myres and Fujita-Nara where lower bounds of the ranks were provided under the assumption that $a = 1$ or $b = 1$. Also, our families of elliptic curves vastly generalize the curves recently investigated by Hatley and Stack.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** M. H. Shahzamanian &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we construct explicit families of transformation monoids whose augmentation submodules are simple and whose associated 0-minimal $\J$-classes have rank greater than two. These examples provide new monoids with simple augmentation submodules and non-complete associated graphs. We also establish a connection between the sandwich matrix of a 0-minimal $\J$-class of rank two and the simplicity of the corresponding augmentation module, yielding a criterion that determines simplicity directly from the rank of this matrix for this class of monoids.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Chao Wang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 4 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a formal analytic proof for a class of non-canonical polynomial continued fractions representing π/4, originally conjectured by the Ramanujan Machine using algorithmic induction [4]. By establishing an explicit correspondence with the ratio of contiguous Gaussian hypergeometric functions 2F1(a, b; c; z), we show that these identities can be derived via a discrete sequence of equivalence transformations. We further prove that the conjectured integer coefficients constitute a symbolically minimal realization of the underlying analytic kernel. Stability analysis confirms that the resulting limit-periodic structures reside strictly within the Worpitzky convergence disk, ensuring absolute convergence. This work demonstrates that such algorithmically discovered identities are not isolated numerical artifacts, but are deeply rooted in the classical theory of hypergeometric transformations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Verlinde's formula for rational vertex operator algebras computes the fusion rules from the modular transformations of characters. In the non semisimple and non finite case, a logarithmic Verlinde formula has been proposed together with David Ridout. In this formula one replaces simple modules by their resolutions by standard modules. Here and under certain natural assumptions this conjecture is proven in generality. The result is illustrated in the examples of the singlet algebras and of the affine vertex algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at any admissible level, i.e. in particular the Verlinde conjectures in these cases are true. In the latter case it is also explained how to compute the actual fusion rules from knowledge of the Grothendieck ring.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a writeup of a resolution of Erdős Problem #728; this is the first Erdős problem (a problem proposed by Paul Erdős which has been collected in the Erdős Problems website) regarded as fully resolved autonomously by an AI system. The system in question is a combination of GPT-5.2 Pro by OpenAI and Aristotle by Harmonic, operated by Kevin Barreto. The final result of the system is a formal proof written in Lean, which we translate to informal mathematics in the present writeup for wider accessibility. The proved result is as follows. We show a logarithmic-gap phenomenon regarding factorial divisibility: For any constants $0<C_1<C_2$ and $0 < \varepsilon < 1/2$ there exist infinitely many triples $(a,b,n)\in\mathbb N^3$ with $\varepsilon n \le a,b \le (1-\varepsilon)n$ such that $$ a!\,b!\mid n!\,(a+b-n)!\qquad\text{and}\qquad C_1\log n < a+b-n < C_2\log n. $$ The argument reduces this to a binomial divisibility $\binom{m+k}{k}\mid\binom{2m}{m}$ and studies it prime-by-prime. By Kummer's theorem, $ν_p\binom{2m}{m}$ translates into a carry count for doubling $m$ in base $p$. We then employ a counting argument to find, in each scale $[M,2M]$, an integer $m$ whose base-$p$ expansions simultaneously force many carries when doubling $m$, for every prime $p\le 2k$, while avoiding the rare event that one of $m+1,\dots,m+k$ is divisible by an unusually high power of $p$. These "carry-rich but spike-free" choices of $m$ force the needed $p$-adic inequalities and the divisibility. The overall strategy is similar to results regarding divisors of $\binom{2n}{n}$ studied earlier by Erdős and by Pomerance.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We remind the classical analytical proof of the transcendence of $\mathrm{e}$ due to Hilbert. Then, using formal power series, we give two algebraic semiformal proofs of this result. The first proof is a specialization of the proof of the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem found by Beukers, Bézivin and Robba [2]. The second proof uses improper integrals of formal power series and is due to this author. We explain what ``semiformal'' means and indicate yet another analytical proof of the transcendence of $\mathrm{e}$. Like the two algebraic proofs, this proof avoids uncountable sets. It is due to this author in [7].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p>3$ be a prime and $b\ge 2$ an integer such that $p$ does not divide $b$. Then $1/p$ has a periodic digit expansion with respect to the basis $b$. The length $q$ of the period is the (multiplicative) order of $b$ mod $p$. In the case $q=p-1$ a formula for the variance of the digits of a period was given previously. This formula involves a Dedekind sum. We determine the variance in the case $q=(p-1)/2$. If $p\equiv 3$ mod 4 a Dedekind sum and the class number of $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{-p})$ occur in the respective formula. If $p\equiv 1$ mod 4, the formula may be much more complex since it involves linear combinations of (possibly many) products of two Bernoulli numbers attached to odd characters.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Geometric and Topological Deep Learning are rapidly growing research areas that enhance machine learning through the use of geometric and topological structures. Within this framework, Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) have emerged as a powerful class of operators for encoding symmetries and designing efficient, interpretable neural architectures. Originally introduced in Topological Data Analysis, GENEOs have since found applications in Deep Learning as tools for constructing equivariant models with reduced parameter complexity. GENEOs provide a unifying framework bridging Geometric and Topological Deep Learning and include the operator computing persistence diagrams as a special case. Their theoretical foundations rely on group actions, equivariance, and compactness properties of operator spaces, grounding them in algebra and geometry while enabling both mathematical rigor and practical relevance. While a previous representation theorem characterized linear GENEOs acting on data of the same type, many real-world applications require operators between heterogeneous data spaces. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a new representation theorem for linear GENEOs acting between different perception pairs, based on generalized T-permutant measures. Under mild assumptions on the data domains and group actions, our result provides a complete characterization of such operators. We also prove the compactness and convexity of the space of linear GENEOs. We further demonstrate the practical impact of this theory by applying the proposed framework to improve the performance of autoencoders, highlighting the relevance of GENEOs in modern machine learning applications.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Consider a bounded prism $(A,I)$ and a bounded quasi-l.c.i algebra $R$ over $\overline{A}$. In this paper, for any prism $S/A$ with a surjection $S\to R$ such that $\widehat{\mathbb L}_{\overline{S}/\overline{A}}$ is a $p$-completely flat module over $\overline{S}$, we establish an equivalence of categories between rational Hodge-Tate crystals on $(R/A)_Δ$ and topologically nilpotent integrable connections on the Hodge--Tate cohomology ring $\overlineΔ_{R/S}$. As an application, for a non-zero divisor $a\in \overline{A}$, we introduce the concept of $a$-smallness for a rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystal on $(R/A)_Δ$. Finally, we focus on some special algebras $R$ over $\mathcal O_{\mathbb C_p}$ (or generally, the ring of integers of an algebraic closed and complete non-archimedean field) including all $p$-completely smooth algebras, $p$-complete algebras with semi-stable reductions and geometric valuation rings. By using our equivalence, we analyze the restriction functor from the category of $a$-small rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystals to the category of $v$-vector bundles. This yields some new results in $p$-adic non-abelian Hodge Theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The McKay correspondence establishes a bijection between the cohomology of a minimal resolution and the irreducible representations of a finite subgroup $Γ\subset \text{SU}(2)$. While traditional proofs rely on static algebraic isomorphisms, we propose a dynamical framework grounded in gauge theory and Morse-Bott theory. We analyze an $S^1$-invariant Morse-Bott function on the minimal resolution, interpreting its gradient flow lines as $1$-parameter families of holonomy representations of flat connections from $Γ$ to $GL(R)$. We conjecture that the flow emanating from a critical submanifold converges asymptotically at the boundary to a specific irreducible representation of $Γ$. This dynamical process explicitly constructs the identification between the cohomology basis and the irreducible representations of $Γ$ prescribed by the McKay correspondence. We prove this conjecture for cyclic cases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Flow cones of a directed acyclic graph admit a family of unimodular triangulations given by Danilov, Karzanov, and Koshevoy (DKK) whose normal fans are related to (generalizations) of the associahedron and permutahedron. A correspondence between these triangulations for certain graphs and maximal cones of a $g$-vector fan of a gentle quiver associated to the graph was discovered by von Bell, Braun, Bruegge, Hanely, Peterson, Serhiyenko, and Yip in 2022. This correspondence has been fruitful in uncovering lattice structures in the triangulations. We start by showing that this correspondence is actually a linear isomorphism. We then consider flow cones of certain graphs with cycles. For this case, we give a DKK-like triangulation of the cone, and extend the correspondence to the finite $g$-vector fan of a corresponding locally gentle quiver. In addition, we extend to cyclic graphs a mysterious result of Postnikov--Stanley and Baldoni--Vergne, giving the volume of flow polytopes of acyclic graphs as the number of certain integer flows on the same graph. We illustrate our results with a two-parameter family of cyclic graphs that includes a cycle graph and nested 2-cycles as special cases. We show that the fans of its DKK-like triangulations are respectively isomorphic to the normal fan of the cyclohedron and of a new polytope with the same $f$-vector but different combinatorial type than the permutahedron.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $γ=0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $δ=0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $γ+δ/e=\mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $γ^{(n)}+δ^{(n)}/e=η^{(n)}$, $n\ge0$ for sequences of constants $γ^{(n)}$, $δ^{(n)}$, and $η^{(n)}$ (given respectively by raw, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). Investigating the $γ^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations (where $γ^{(0)}=1$ and $γ^{(1)}=γ$), we find that at least one of the pair {$γ,γ^{(2)}$} and at least two of each set {$γ,γ^{(n)},γ^{(n+1)},\ldots,γ^{(2n)}$}, for $2\leq n\leq26$, are transcendental, with analogous results for the sequence $Γ^{(n)}(1)=\left(-1\right)^{n}γ^{\left(n\right)}$. We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $η^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent, and therefore transcendental, for all $n\ge0$, implying that at least one of each pair, {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e$} and {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e,δ^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n\ge1$. Further analysis of the $γ^{(n)}$ and $η^{(n)}$ reveals that the values $δ^{(n)}/e$ are transcendental infinitely often with positive asymptotic density. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tildeδ^{(n)}$ and $\tildeη^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $γ^{(n)}+\tildeδ^{(n)}/e=\tildeη^{(n)}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Many challenging questions about the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group, $GT$, are motivated by the fact that this group receives the injective homomorphism (called the Ihara embedding) from the absolute Galois group, $G_Q$, of rational numbers. Although the question about the surjectivity of the Ihara embedding is a very challenging problem, in this paper, we construct a family of finite non-abelian quotients of $GT$ that receive surjective homomorphisms from $G_Q$. We also assemble these finite quotients into an infinite (non-abelian) profinite quotient of $GT$. We prove that the natural homomorphism from $G_Q$ to the resulting profinite group is also surjective. We give an explicit description of this profinite group. To achieve these goals, we used the groupoid $GTSh$ of $GT$-shadows for the gentle version of the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group. This groupoid was introduced in the recent paper by the second author and J. Guynee and the set $Ob(GTSh)$ of objects of $GTSh$ is a poset of certain finite index normal subgroups of the Artin braid group on 3 strands. We introduce a sub-poset $Dih$ of $Ob(GTSh)$ related to the family of dihedral groups and call it the dihedral poset. We show that each element $K$ of $Dih$ is the only object of its connected component in $GTSh$. Using the surjectivity of the cyclotomic character, we prove that, if the order of the dihedral group corresponding to $K$ is a power of 2, then the natural homomorphism from $G_Q$ to the finite group $GTSh(K, K)$ is surjective. We introduce the Lochak-Schneps conditions on morphisms of $GTSh$ and prove that each morphism of $GTSh$ with the target $K$ in $Dih$ satisfies the Lochak-Schneps conditions. Finally, we conjecture that the natural homomorphism from $G_Q$ to the finite group $GTSh(K, K)$ is surjective for every object $K$ of the dihedral poset.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We generalize the torsion vanishing results of Caraiani-Scholze and Koshikawa. Our results apply to the cohomology of general Shimura varieties $(\mathbf{G},X)$ of PEL type $A$ or $C$, localized at a suitable maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ in the spherical Hecke algebra at primes $p$ such that $\mathbf{G}_{\mathbb{Q}_{p}}$ is a group for which we know the Fargues-Scholze local Langlands correspondence is the semi-simplification of a suitably nice local Langlands correspondence. This is accomplished by combining Koshikawa's technique, the theory of geometric Eisenstein series over the Fargues-Fontaine curve, the work of Santos describing the structure of the fibers of the minimally and toroidally compactified Hodge-Tate period morphism for general PEL type Shimura varieties of type $A$ or $C$, and ideas developed by Zhang on comparing Hecke correspondences on the moduli stack of $G$-bundles with the cohomology of Shimura varieties. In the process, we also establish a description of the generic part of the cohomology that bears resemblance to the work of Xiao-Zhu. Moreover, we also construct a filtration on the compactly supported cohomology that differs from Manotovan's filtration in the case that the Shimura variety is non-compact, allowing us to circumvent some of the circumlocutions taken by Cariani-Scholze. Our method showcases a very general strategy for proving such torsion vanishing results, and should bear even more fruit once the inputs are generalized. Motivated by this, we formulate an even more general torsion vanishing conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the geometric Langlands program over function fields, Braverman-Gaitsgory and Laumon constructed geometric Eisenstein functors which geometrize the classical construction of Eisenstein series. Fargues and Scholze very recently constructed a general candidate for the local Langlands correspondence, via a geometric Langlands correspondence occurring over the Fargues-Fontaine curve. We carry some of the theory of geometric Eisenstein series over to the Fargues-Fontaine setting. Namely, given a quasi-split connected reductive group $G/\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ with simply connected derived group and maximal torus $T$, we construct an Eisenstein functor $\mathrm{nEis}(-)$, which takes sheaves on $Bun_{T}$ to sheaves on $Bun_{G}$. We show that, given a sufficiently nice $L$-parameter $φ_{T}: W_{\mathbb{Q}_{p}} \rightarrow \phantom{}^{L}T$, there is a Hecke eigensheaf on $Bun_{G}$ with eigenvalue $φ$, given by applying $\mathrm{nEis}(-)$ to the Hecke eigensheaf $\mathcal{S}_{φ_{T}}$ on $Bun_{T}$ attached to $φ_{T}$ by Fargues and Zou. We show that $\mathrm{nEis}(\mathcal{S}_{φ_{T}})$ interacts well with Verdier duality, and, assuming compatibility of the Fargues-Scholze correspondence with a suitably nice form of the local Langlands correspondence, provide an explicit formula for the stalks of the eigensheaf in terms of parabolic inductions of the character $χ$ attached to $φ_{T}$. This has several surprising consequences. First, it recovers special cases of an averaging formula of Shin for the cohomology of local Shimura varieties with rational coefficients, and generalizes it to the non-minuscule case. Second, it refines the averaging formula in the cases where the parameter $φ$ is sufficiently nice, giving an explicit formula for the degrees of cohomology that certain parabolic inductions sit in, and this refined formula holds even with torsion coefficients.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a detailed and mathematically rigorous analysis of the path integrals of chiral fermions supported on holomorphic curves on $T^* \mathbb{C}$ in a general noncommutative instanton background. It is shown that such path integrals can be interpreted as computing instanton analogs of matrix coefficients of monopole scattering matrices. Generalizing the known relation between monopole scattering matrices and $R$-matrices of (shifted) Yangians $\mathsf{Y}(\mathfrak{gl}_r)$, our formalism gives rise to a novel geometric method to calculate $R$-matrices of (shifted) affine Yangians $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_r)$. This may also be viewed as an explicit description of double affine Grassmannian slices by $\infty \times \infty$ matrices, compatible with factorization. Our approach unifies a number of earlier results in the literature, and also leads to interesting new results and conjectures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X\to S$ be a smooth projective morphism. Katz proved the Grothendieck-Katz $p$-curvature conjecture for the Gauss-Manin connection on the $i$-th cohomology of $X/S$: if its $p$-curvature vanishes mod $p$ for infinitely many $p$, then the action of $π_1(S,s)$ on $H^i(X_s, \mathbb{Z})$ factors through a finite group. We prove a non-abelian analogue of this statement: if the $p$-curvature of the isomonodromy foliation on the moduli of flat bundles of rank $r$ on $X/S$ vanishes mod $p$ for infinitely many $p$, then the action of $π_1(S,s)$ on the rank $r$ integral characters of $π_1(X_s)$ factors through a finite group. We deduce many new cases of the Bost/Ekedahl--Shepherd-Barron--Taylor conjecture. The proofs rely on a non-abelian version of Katz's formula, and a non-abelian version of the Hodge index theorem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Euler characteristic of $\ell$-adic local systems on the moduli stack $\mathcal{A}_n$ of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension $n$ associated to algebraic representations of $\mathbf{GSp}_{2n}$, as virtual representations of the absolute Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}$ and the unramified Hecke algebra of $\mathbf{GSp}_{2n}$. To this end we take the last steps of the Ihara-Langlands-Kottwitz method to compute the intersection cohomology of minimal compactifications of Siegel modular varieties in level one, following work of Kottwitz and Morel, proving an unconditional reformulation of Kottwitz' conjecture in this case. This entails proving the existence of $\mathrm{GSpin}$-valued Galois representations associated to certain level one automorphic representations for $\mathbf{PGSp}_{2n}$ and $\mathbf{SO}_{4n}$. As a consequence we prove the existence of $\mathrm{GSpin}$-valued Galois representations associated to level one Siegel eigenforms, a higher genus analogue of theorems of Deligne (genus one) and Weissauer (genus two). Using Morel's work and Franke's spectral sequence we derive explicit formulas expressing the Euler characteristic of compactly supported cohomology of automorphic $\ell$-adic local systems on Siegel modular varieties in terms of intersection cohomology. Specializing to genus three and level one, we prove an explicit conjectural formula of Bergström, Faber and van der Geer for the compactly supported Euler characteristic in terms of spin Galois representations associated to level one Siegel cusp forms. Specializing to trivial local systems we give explicit formulas for the number of points of $\mathcal{A}_n$ over finite fields for all $n \leq 7$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A theorem of Nomizu and van Est computes the cohomology of a compact nilmanifold, or equivalently the group cohomology of an arithmetic subgroup of a unipotent linear algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}$. We prove a similar result for the cohomology of a compact open subgroup of a unipotent linear algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}_{\ell}$ with coefficients in a complex of continuous $\ell$-adic representations. We work with the triangulated categories defined by Ekedahl which play the role of ``derived categories of continuous $\ell$-adic representations''. This is motivated by Pink's formula computing the derived direct image of an $\ell$-adic local system on a Shimura variety in its minimal compactification, and its application to automorphic perverse sheaves on Shimura varieties. The key technical result is the computation of the cohomology with coefficients in a unipotent representation with torsion coefficients by an explicit complex of polynomial cochains which is of finite type.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Classical studies of the Fibonacci sequence focus on its periodicity modulo $m$ (the Pisano periods) with canonical initialization. We investigate instead the complete periodic structure arising from all $m^2$ possible initializations in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. We discover perfect mirror symmetry between the Fibonacci recurrence $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and its parity transform $a_n = - a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and observe fractal self-similarity in the extension from prime to prime power moduli. Additionally, we classify prime moduli based on their quadratic reciprocity and demonstrate that periodic sequences exhibit weight preservation under modular extension. Furthermore, we define a minima distribution $P(n)$ governed by Lucas ratios, which satisfies the symmetric relation $P(n)=P(1-n)$. For cyclotomic recurrences, we propose explicit counting functions for the number of distinct periods with connections to necklace enumeration. These findings imply potential connections to Viswanath's random recurrence, modular forms and L-functions.</p></details>

Using this algorithm, we give an alternative proof that the maximal orders of discriminant 7 and 13, which are non-Euclidean, are PIDs. We also provide a completely arithmetic proof of a result of Gordon Pall that shows that, in an order that is a PID, an element of whose norm is divisible by an integer $m$ always has a left and a right divisor with norm $m$. This easily yields the existence and uniqueness (up to associates) of factorizations of a quaternion modeled on a factorization of its norm.</p></details>

> **Comment:** The result of arXiv:2210.05290 by the same authors has been covered and further generalized by the current preprint

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $D$ be a totally definite quaternion algebra over a totally real number field $F$, and $\mathcal{O}$ be an $O_F$-order (of full rank) in $D$. The type number $t(\mathcal{O})$ is an important arithmetic invariant of $\mathcal{O}$ that counts the number of isomorphism classes of orders belonging to the same genus as $\mathcal{O}$ (i.e. locally isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}$ at every finite place $\mathfrak{p}$ of $F$). The type number formula has been studied by Eichler, Peters, Pizer, Vigneras, Körner and many others. As the genus of $\mathcal{O}$ further divides into spinor genera, one naturally seeks a finer type number formula for the number of isomorphism classes of orders belonging to the same spinor genus of $\mathcal{O}$. The main goal of this paper is to provide such a refinement for a large class of quaternion $O_F$-orders $\mathcal{O}$ that includes all Eichler orders. This enables us to prove that $t(\mathcal{O})$ is divisible by the order of a quotient group $\mathrm{WSG}(\mathcal{O})$ of the Gauss genus group $\mathrm{Cl}^+(O_F)/\mathrm{Cl}^+(O_F)^2$ naturally attached to $\mathcal{O}$. Similarly, we show that the trace of the $\mathfrak{n}$-Brandt matrix $\mathfrak{B}(\mathcal{O}, \mathfrak{n})$ is divisible by the class number $h(F)$ for any nonzero integral $O_F$-ideal $\mathfrak{n}$. In particular, the class number $h(\mathcal{O})=\mathrm{Tr}(\mathfrak{B}(\mathcal{O}, O_F))$ is always divisible by $h(F)$ for such quaternion orders. This generalizes the divisibility result of $h(\mathcal{O})$ proved in a different way by Chia-Fu Yu and the second named author [Indiana Univ. Math. J., Vol. 70, No. 2 (2021)] in the case when $\mathcal{O}$ is a maximal $O_F$-order in a totally definite quaternion algebra unramified at all the finite places.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $g(X)$ be a polynomial over a finite field ${\mathbb F}_q$ with degree $o(q^{1/2})$, and let $χ$ be the quadratic residue character. We give a polynomial time algorithm to recover $g(X)$ (up to perfect square factors) given the values of $χ\circ g$ on ${\mathbb F}_q$, with up to a constant fraction of the values having errors. This was previously unknown even for the case of no errors. We give a similar algorithm for additive characters of polynomials over fields of characteristic $2$. This gives the first polynomial time algorithm for decoding dual-BCH codes of polynomial dimension from a constant fraction of errors. Our algorithms use ideas from Stepanov's polynomial method proof of the classical Weil bounds on character sums, as well as from the Berlekamp-Welch decoding algorithm for Reed-Solomon codes. A crucial role is played by what we call *pseudopolynomials*: high degree polynomials, all of whose derivatives behave like low degree polynomials on ${\mathbb F}_q$. Both these results can be viewed as algorithmic versions of the Weil bounds for this setting.</p></details>

Alternately, an equivalent classification is if any equality of the form $$\sum_{s\in \mathcal S} \varepsilon_s \cdot s =0$$ where $\varepsilon_s \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ implies that all the $\varepsilon_s$'s are $0$. For a dissociated set $\mathcal S$, we prove that for $c_\ast = \frac 12 \log_2 \left(\frac π2\right)$ and any $c_\ast-1<C<c_\ast$, we have $$\mathcal S(n) \,:=\, \mathcal S\cap [1,n] \,\le\, \log_2 n +\frac 12 \log_2\log_2 n + C$$ for all $n\in \mathcal N_C$ with asymptotic density $\mathbf d\left(\mathcal N_C\right)=2-2^{c_\ast-C}$. Further, we consider the greedy algorithm for generating these sets and prove that this algorithm always eventually doubles. Finally, we also consider some generalizations of dissociated sets and prove similar results about them.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we are interested in the stability of the $2$-rank of the class group in the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-extension of real biquadratic fields. In fact, we give several families of real biquadratic fields $K$ such that $ rank(A(K)) =rank(A_\infty(K))$ and $rank(A(K))\leq 3$, where $A(K)$ and $A_\infty(K)$ are the $2$-class group and the $2$-Iwasawa module of $K$ respectively. Moreover, Greenberg's conjecture is verified for some new families of number fields; in particular, we determine the complete list of all real biquadratic fields with trivial $2$-Iwasawa module. This work is a continuation of M. M. Chems-Eddin, Greenberg's conjecture and Iwasawa module of real biquadratic fields I, J. Number Theory, 281 (2026), 224-266.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this study, we introduce the theory of what we call Hecke vector-forms. A Hecke vector-form can be viewed as a vector function representation of some quasiautomorphic form that transforms like an automorphic form on an arbitrarily chosen Hecke triangle group. In other words, because quasiautomorphic forms have complicated transformation behavior when compared with automorphic forms, the construction of a Hecke vector-form is to retrieve a transformation behavior analogous to the simpler, automorphic case. In this way, a Hecke vector-form can be viewed as the vector function analogue of an automorphic form. Since our work is for any quasi-automorphic form over an arbitrary Hecke triangle group, we briefly review the construction of such groups. Furthermore, we review the derivation of the hauptmodul, the automorphic forms, and the normalized quasiautomorphic form of weight 2 for any Hecke triangle group. We then proceed to the theory of Hecke vector-forms and establish the desired transformation behavior with respect to the generators of the associated group. A proof of this fact is strictly elementary, relying on fine properties of binomial coefficients. Lastly, we relate the vector-forms to Hecke automorphic linear differential equations, which are analogues of the frequently researched modular linear differential equations. Our results include Hecke vector-forms of the classical quasimodular forms as the simplest case.</p></details>

In this paper, we study the Gross-Kudla-Schoen modified diagonal 1-cycles of these curves. We prove that if $p \ge 3$ is a prime, then for every $λ$ the Griffiths Abel-Jacobi image of the modified diagonal cycle of $X_{p,λ}$ is nontrivial for every cuspidal choice of a base point. On the other hand, we show that the modified diagonal cycle and hence the Ceresa cycle of $X_{3,λ}$ is torsion in the Chow group for every $λ$ and every choice of a base point.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Quantum groups of semisimple Lie algebras at roots of unity admit several different forms. Among them is the De Concini-Kac form, which is the easiest to define but, perhaps, hardest to study. In this paper, we propose a suitable modification to the De Concini-Kac form, namely the even part algebra, which has some appealing features. Notably, it behaves uniformly with respect to the order of the roots of unity and admits an adjoint action of the Lusztig form. We revisit several results due to De Concini-Kac-Procesi and Tanisaki for the even part algebra. Namely, we give conceptual definitions of the Frobenius and Harish-Chandra centers and describe the entire center in terms of these two subalgebras getting a complete quantum analog of the Veldkamp theorem on the center of the universal enveloping algebras in positive characteristic. We investigate the Azumaya locus of the even part algebra over its center. We also show that the locally finite part of the even part algebra under the adjoint action of the Lusztig form is isomorphic to the reflection equation algebra, which is the quantized coordinate algebra with the product twisted by $R$-matrix. Some results on Lusztig forms at roots of unity are revisited and proved in greater generality including Kempf vanishing theorem and good filtrations on the quantized coordinate algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Newman's conjecture (proved by Rodgers and Tao in 2018) concerns a certain family of deformations $\{ξ_t(s)\}_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$ of the Riemann xi function for which there exists an associated constant $Λ\in \mathbb{R}$ (called the de Bruijn-Newman constant) such that all the zeros of $ξ_t$ lie on the critical line if and only if $t \geq Λ$. The Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that $Λ\leq 0$, and Newman's conjecture states that $Λ\geq 0$. In this paper we give a new proof of Newman's conjecture which avoids many of the complications in the proof of Rodgers and Tao. Unlike the previous best methods for bounding $Λ$, our approach does not require any information about the zeros of the zeta function, and it can be readily be applied to a wide variety of $L$-functions. In particular, we establish that any $L$-function in the extended Selberg class has an associated de Bruijn-Newman constant and that all of these constants are nonnegative. Stated in the Riemann xi function case, our argument proceeds by showing that for every $t < 0$ the function $ξ_t$ can be approximated in terms of a Dirichlet series $ζ_t(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\exp(\frac{t}{4} \log^2 n)n^{-s}$ whose zeros then provide infinitely many zeros of $ξ_t$ off the critical line.</p></details>

This conjectural characterization is inspired by and generalizes the Relative Manin-Mumford Conjecture for families of abelian varieties, recently proved by Gao and Habegger, and it includes as special cases the Manin-Mumford Conjecture (theorem of Raynaud) and the Dynamical Manin-Mumford Conjecture (posed by Ghioca, Tucker, and Zhang). We provide examples where the equivalence is known to hold, and we show that several recent results can be viewed as special cases. Finally, we give the proof of one implication in the conjectural characterization.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For each integer $d\geq 2$, let $M_d$ denote the moduli space of maps $f: \mathbb{P}^1\to \mathbb{P}^1$ of degree $d$. We study the geometric configurations of subsets of postcritically finite (or PCF) maps in $M_d$. A complex-algebraic subvariety $Y \subset M_d$ is said to be PCF-special if it contains a Zariski-dense set of PCF maps. Here we prove that there are only finitely many positive-dimensional irreducible PCF-special subvarieties in $M_d$ with degree $\leq D$. In addition, there exist constants $N = N(D,d)$ and $B = B(D,d)$ so that for any complex algebraic subvariety $X \subset M_d$ of degree $\leq D$, the Zariski closure $\overline{X\cap\mathrm{PCF}}~$ has at most $N$ irreducible components, each with degree $\leq B$. We also prove generalizations of these results for points with small critical height in $M_d(\bar{\mathbb{Q}})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the parametric family of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ of the form $E_{m} : y^{2} = x(x - n_{1})(x - n_{2}) + t^{2}$, where $n_{1}$, $n_{2}$ and $t$ are particular polynomial expressions in an integral variable $m$. In this paper, we investigate the torsion group $E_{m}(\mathbb{Q})_{\rm{tors}}$, a lower bound for the Mordell-Weil rank $r({E_{m}})$ and the $2$-Selmer group ${\rm{Sel}}_{2}(E_{m})$ under certain conditions on $m$. This extends the previous works done in this direction, which are mostly concerned with the Mordell-Weil ranks of various parametric families of elliptic curves.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A band is a semigroup in which each element is idempotent. In recent years, there has been a lot of activity on the representation theory of the subclass of left regular bands due to connections to Markov chains associated to hyperplane arrangements, oriented matroids, matroids and CAT(0) cube complexes. We prove here that the integral semigroup algebra of a band is isomorphic to the integral path algebra of a quiver modulo an admissible ideal. This leads to a uniform bound quiver presentation for band algebras over all fields. Also, we answer a question of Margolis, Saliola and Steinberg by proving that the integral semigroup algebra of a CW left regular band is isomorphic to the quotient of the integral path algebra of the Hasse diagram of its support semilattice modulo the ideal generated by the sum of all paths of length two. This includes, for example, hyperplane face semigroup algebras.</p></details>

Added natural density section 7 proving quantitative APRC

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An ideal setting to exhibit infinite sets of primes $p$ relative to which an integer is a primitive root $\pmod p$ is provided by the Bézout subdomain $\widetilde{\mathbb{B}}:=\mathbb{Z}^{\mathbb{P}}/\mathfrak{U}$ of the valuation domain $\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}=\prod_{\mathfrak{U}} \mathbb{Z}_p$ with respect to a nonprincipal ultrafilter $\mathfrak{U}$ on $\mathbb{P}$, extant via Chebotarev's theorem and the ultrafilter theorem and such that the relative algebraic closure $\mathbb{L}:=\mathrm{Abs}(\widetilde{\mathbb{Q}})$ of the prime field of the valued field $\widetilde{\mathbb{Q}}=\prod_{\mathfrak{U}} \mathbb{Q}_p$ contains $\sqrt{-\tilde p}$ for $p\in\mathbb{P}$, contains no $\sqrt[3]{\tilde q}$ for $q\in\mathbb{P}$, and has $\mathrm{tor}(\mathbb{L}^\times)=\langle ζ_6\rangle$. Results include positive resolutions of the conjectured infinitude of primes $p$ for which (i) $\frac{p-1}{6}$ is prime and (ii) a non-perfect-square $-1\neq m\in\mathbb{Z}$ is a primitive root $\pmod p$, establishing as manifest the efficacy of ultraproduct treatments in resolving number theory problems requiring certification of countably infinite conforming sets. Furthermore, we extend these results to the quantitative regime by identifying the primitive-root indicator as a projection in the $C^\ast$-algebra $\ell^\infty(\mathbb{P})$. We prove that the Bézout rigidity of $\widetilde{\mathbb{B}}$ and the $\mathbf{\tildeν}$-anchor enforce the normality of the density state, thereby algebraically precluding ``spectral leakage'' into the infinite tail of Kummer obstructions. This provides a structural, GRH-free proof that the natural density exists as the vacuum expectation value in a GNS representation: $δ_m=ω_δ(f_m)= c_m\prod_{q\in\mathbb{P}}(1-\frac{1}{q(q-1)})$ where $\prod_{q\in\mathbb{P}}(1-\frac{1}{q(q-1)})$ is the Artin Euler product.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we investigate multiple polylogarithms with non-positive multi-indices (nonpositive MPLs) from a combinatorial and algebraic viewpoint. By introducing a correspondence between non-positive multiple polylogarithms and Magnus polynomials in a free associative algebra, we obtain an explicit Magnus-type representation of products of mono-indexed non-positive MPLs. The main identity (Theorem A) expresses such a product as a single non-positive MPL indexed by a Magnus polynomial, which may be regarded as a Möbius inversion of the expansion formula due to Duchamp-Hoang Ngoc Minh-Ngo. Moreover, we study the effects of permuted indices and show that certain differences of Magnus polynomials belong to the kernel of the linear map ${\rm Li}^-_{\bullet}$ , leading to new functional equations among non-positive MPLs of the same weight and depth. These results clarify the combinatorial structure underlying non-positive MPLs and reveal a close connection with the Magnus expansion in non-commutative algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Hurwitz spaces which parametrize branched covers of the line play a prominent role in inverse Galois theory. This paper surveys fifty years of works in this direction with emphasis on recent advances. Based on the Riemann-Hurwitz theory of covers, the geometric and arithmetic setup is first reviewed, followed by the semi-modern developments of the 1990--2010 period: large fields, compactification, descent theory, modular towers. The second half of the paper highlights more recent achievements that have reshaped the arithmetic of Hurwitz spaces, notably via the systematic study of the ring of components. These include the construction of components defined over ${\mathbb Q}$, and the Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland approach to rational points over finite fields, applied to the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics and the Malle conjecture over function fields ${\mathbb F}_q(T)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a contour integral formalism for computing the K-theoretic equivariant 3-vertex. Within the Jeffrey--Kirwan (JK) residue framework, we show that, by an appropriate choice of the reference vector, both the equivariant Donaldson--Thomas (DT) and Pandharipande--Thomas (PT) 3-vertices can be extracted from the same integrand. We analyze three distinct limits of the PT 3-vertex, recovering the unrefined topological vertex, the refined topological vertex, and the Macdonald refined topological vertex. Higher-rank extensions of PT counting and the DT/PT correspondence are also explored. From a quantum algebraic perspective, we construct an operator version of the equivariant PT 3-vertex and term it the Pandharipande--Thomas $qq$-character. We then discuss its connection with the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{1}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a purely $N$-periodic continued fraction $ξ=[\overline{a_0,a_1,\dots,a_{N-1}}]=[a_0,a_1,\cdots]$, with $a_k=a_{k+N}$ for all $k\ge 0$, and convergents $h_n/k_n=[a_0,a_1,\dots,a_n]$, we obtain explicit expressions for the weighted error sums $f_ξ(s)=\sum a_{n+1}\lvert h_n-ξk_n\rvert^s$ for $s>1$. A key observation is that, for each residue class $k_0\in{0,1,\dots,N-1}$, the subsequence of approximation errors $(h_k-ξk_k)$ with $k\equiv k_0 \pmod N$ forms a geometric progression. In addition, we extend our methods to generalized continued fractions with numerators $(b_n)$, obtaining Euler-type identities and weighted error-sum formulae for $π$ and $\ln 2$.</p></details>
