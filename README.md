### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15709v1'>2512.15709</a>\]&nbsp; **Optimal bounds for sums of non-negative arithmetic functions**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Andrés Chirre, Harald Andrés Helfgott &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A(s) = \sum_n a_n n^{-s}$ be a Dirichlet series admitting meromorphic continuation to the complex plane. Assume we know the location of the poles of $A(s)$ with $|\Im s| \leq T$, and their residues, for some large constant $T$. It is natural to ask how such finite spectral information may be best used to estimate partial sums $\sum_{n\leq x} a_n$. Here, we prove a sharp, general result on sums $\sum_{n\leq x} a_n n^{-σ}$ for $a_n$ non-negative, giving an optimal way to use information on the poles of $A(s)$ with $|\Im s|\leq T$, with no need for zero-free regions. We give not just bounds, but an explicit formula with compact support. Our bounds on $ψ(x)-x$ are, unsurprisingly, better and often simpler than a long list of existing explicit versions of the Prime Number Theorem. We treat the case of $M(x)$ and similar functions in a companion paper. Our solution mixes a Fourier-analytic approach in the style of Wiener--Ikehara with contour-shifting, using optimal approximants of Beurling--Selberg type found in (Graham--Vaaler, 1981).</p></details>

> **Comment:** 33 pages. We added results about torsion points over arbitrary infinite perfect fields, including the most interesting case of the field of rational numbers

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $d\geq 2$ be an integer, $K_0$ a perfect field such that $char(K_0)$ does not divide $d$, $n > d$ an integer prime to $d$, $f(x)\in K_0[x]$ a degree $n$ monic polynomial without repeated roots, and $C_{f,d}$ a smooth projective model of the affine curve $y^d=f(x)$. Let $J(C_{f,d})$ be the Jacobian of the $K_0$-curve $C_{f,d} $. We identify $C_{f,d}$ with its canonical image in $J(C_{f,d})$ (such that the infinite point of $C_{f,d}$ goes to the zero of the group law on $J(C_{f,d})$). We say that an integer $m>1$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K_0$ if there exists a polynomial $f(x)$ as above such that $C_{f,d}(K_0)$ contains a torsion point of order $m$. Earlier we proved that if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable, then either $m=d$ or $m \geq n$ (in addition, both $d$ and $n$ are $(n,d)$-reachable). In the present paper we prove the following. If $n<m<2n$ and if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K_0$, then either $d|m$ or $m \equiv n \bmod d$. If either $char(K_0)=0$ or $K_0$ in infinite and $char(K_0)>n$, then $d\cdot [(n+d)/d]$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if and only if $n-(d-1)\cdot [(n+d)/d]\ge 0$. If $char(K_0)=0$, then $n+d$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if and only if $d^2-2d<n$. If $d=2$ (the hyperelliptic case) and $char(K_0)=0$, then $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if $n+1 \le m \le 2n+1$. (The case when $n \le m \le 3(n-1)/2$ was done earlier by E.V. Flynn.)</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06005v2'>2508.06005</a>\]&nbsp; **The Hardy--Ramanujan inequality for sifted sets and its applications**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Steve Fan &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 44 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The well-known Hardy--Ramanujan inequality states that if $ω(n)$ denotes the number of distinct prime factors of a positive integer $n$, then there is an absolute constant $C>0$ such that uniformly for $x\ge2$ and $k\in\mathbb{N}$, $$\#\{n\le x\colonω(n)=k\}\ll\frac{x(\log\log x+C)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!\log x}.$$ A myriad of generalizations and variations of this inequality have been discovered. In this paper, we establish a weighted version of this inequality for sifted sets, which generalizes an earlier result of Halász and implies Timofeev's theorems on shifted primes. We then explore its applications to a variety of intriguing problems, such as large deviations of $ω$ on subsets of integers, the Erdős multiplication table problem, divisors of shifted primes, and the image of the Carmichael $λ$-function. Building on the same circle of ideas, we also generalize Troupe's result on the normal order of $ω(s(n))$ for the sum-of-proper-divisors function $s(n)$, confirming for the first time the weighted version of a special case of a 1992 conjecture by Erdős, Granville, Pomerance, and Spiro.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 16 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Wasserstein distance quantifies the distance between two probability measures on a metric space. We prove an analogue of the Berry-Esseen inequality for the Wasserstein distance on a finite area hyperbolic surface. This inequality controls the Wasserstein distance via an average of Weyl sums, which are integrals of Maass cusp forms and Eisenstein series with respect to these probability measures. As applications, we prove upper bounds for the Wasserstein distance for some equidistribution problems on the modular surface $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}) \backslash \mathbb{H}$, namely Duke's theorems on the equidistribution of Heegner points and of closed geodesics and Watson's theorem on the mass equidistribution of Hecke-Maass cusp forms conditionally under the assumption of the generalised Lindelof hypothesis.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study GL-equivariant modules over the infinite variable polynomial ring $S = k[x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, ...]$ with $k$ an infinite field of characteristic $p > 0$. We extend many of Sam--Snowden's far-reaching results from characteristic zero to this setting. For example, while the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of a finitely generated GL-equivariant $S$-module need not be finite in positive characteristic, we show that the resolution still has finitely many "linear strands of higher slope". The crux of this paper is two technical results. The first is an extension to positive characteristic of Snowden's recent linearization of Draisma's embedding theorem which we use to study the generic category of $S$-modules. The second is a Nagpal-type "shift theorem" about torsion $S$-modules for which we introduce certain categorifications of the Hasse derivative. These two results together allow us to obtain explicit generators for the derived category. In a follow-up paper, we also use these results to prove finiteness results for local cohomology modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we prove a new Rogers--Ramanujan-type identity, involving grounded partitions, by computing a character of the affine Kac--Moody algebra $D_4^{(3)}$ in two different ways. The product side is derived using Lepowsky's product formula, while the sum side is obtained using perfect crystals with a technique of Dousse and Konan.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 95 + 29 pages incl. a 11-page standalone readable summary; v2: various typos fixed

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The low-energy expansion of genus-one string amplitudes produces infinite families of non-holomorphic modular forms after each step of integrating over a point on the torus worldsheet which are known as elliptic modular graph forms (eMGFs). We solve the differential equations of eMGFs depending on a single point $z$ and the modular parameter $τ$ via iterated integrals over holomorphic modular forms which individually transform inhomogeneously under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$. Suitable generating series of these iterated integrals over $τ$, their complex conjugates and single-valued multiple zeta values (svMZVs) are combined to attain equivariant transformations under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ such that their components are modular forms. Our generating series of equivariant iterated integrals for eMGFs is related to elliptic multiple polylogarithms (eMPLs) through a gauge transform of the flat Calaque-Enriquez-Etingof connection. By converting iterated $τ$-integrals to iterated integrals over points on a torus, we arrive at an explicit construction of single-valued eMPLs where all the monodromies in the points cancel. Each single-valued eMPL depending on a single point $z$ is found to be a finite combination of meromorphic eMPLs, their complex conjugates, svMZVs and equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals. Our generating series determines the latter two admixtures via so-called zeta generators and Tsunogai derivations which act on the two generators $x$, $y$ of a free Lie algebra and where the coefficients of words in $x,y$ define the single-valued eMPLs.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jitendra Bajpai, Mattia Cavicchi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider certain families of Hecke characters $φ$ over a quadratic imaginary field $F$. According to the Bloch-Beilinson conjectures, the order of vanishing of the $L$-function $L(φ,s)$ at the central point $s=-1$ should be equal to the dimension of the space of extensions of the Tate motive $\mathbb{Q}(1)$ by the motive associated with $φ$. In this article, we construct candidates for the corresponding extensions of Hodge structures, assuming that the sign of the functional equation of $L(φ,s)$ is $-1$. This is accomplished through the cohomology of variations of Hodge structures over Picard modular surfaces associated with $F$ and Harder's theory of Eisenstein cohomology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these extensions are naturally realized within certain biextensions. We outline a program to compute the biextension height and utilize it to establish the non-triviality of these extensions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $c>0$, let $X_c$ denote the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|<\frac{1}{cq^2}$ has only finitely many rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$. It is a classical fact, known since the 1950s, that $X_c$ is uncountable for $c>3$ and countable for $c<3$. However, the cardinality of $X_3$ does not appear to be present in the literature. We prove that $X_3$ is uncountable. More generally, we show that for any $n\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$, the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ with Lagrange value exactly $3$ and such that $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|<\frac{1}{3q^2}$ has exactly $n$ rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$ is also uncountable.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Christoph Aistleitner, Zakhar Kabluchko, Joscha Prochno &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 30 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of lacunary trigonometric sums $S_n(ω) := \sum_{k=1}^n \cos (2 πa_k ω)$, $ω\in[0,1]$, and show that cumulant growth is highly sensitive to the arithmetic structure of the sequence $(a_k)_{k \geq 1}$ of positive integers. In particular, if $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_{k+1}/a_k = η> 1$ for some transcendental number $η$, we prove that for every $m\in \mathbb N$ the $m$-th cumulant of $S_n$ is asymptotically equivalent to the $m$-th cumulant of the ``independent model'' $\widetilde{S}_n := \sum_{k=1}^n \cos (2 πa_k U_k)$, where $U_1, U_2, \dots$ are independent random variables having uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. In particular, the order of growth of the cumulants as $n \to \infty$ is linear in this case. We also show that the transcendence condition for $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_{k+1}/a_k$ is in general necessary: when the ratio limit $η$ is algebraic, the cumulants of $S_n$ may have a different asymptotic order from those of $\widetilde{S}_n$. For instance, for $a_k = 2^k+1$ (with $η= 2$), the sixth cumulant of $S_n$ grows quadratically in $n$. In contrast, for $a_k = 2^k$ (again $η= 2$) or when $(a_k)_{k \geq 1}$ is the Fibonacci sequence (with $η= (1+\sqrt 5)/2$), the $m$-th cumulant of $S_n$ grows linearly as $n\to\infty$, but with a growth rate that differs from the one of the independent model $\widetilde{S}_n$. Overall, our results show that the asymptotic behavior of the cumulants of lacunary trigonometric sums depends on arithmetic effects in a very delicate way. This is particularly remarkable since many other probabilistic limit theorems, such as the Central Limit Theorem, hold for lacunary trigonometric sums in a universal way without any such sensitivity towards arithmetic effects.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish an explicit lower bound for the Néron-Tate height on elliptic curves with complex multiplication, for nontorsion points defined over the maximal abelian extension of a number field. Building on a strategy developed by Amoroso, David, and Zannier, we provide an alternative proof of a theorem originally due to Baker. The novelty in our approach is that it produces a lower bound that is fully explicit and independent of the discriminant of the base field.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb{N}$ be the set of natural numbers and $\mathcal{S}=\big\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2,\cdots\big\}$ the set of squares. Let $\mathcal{W}$ be an additive complement of $\mathcal{S}$ and $$ f(n)=\#\big\{(w,m^2)\in \mathcal{W}\times \mathcal{S}: n=w+m^2\big\}. $$ It is proved that there is a positive constant $c_{\mathcal{W}}$ (depending at most on $\mathcal{W}$) such that $$ \sum_{n\le N}f(n)-N\ge c_{\mathcal{W}}N $$ for infinitely many positive integers $N$, which makes some progress on a 1993 conjecture of Cilleruelo. As consequences of the this result, we answer negatively a 2001 problem of Ruzsa as well as a 2017 problem of Ben Green.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Xiao-Jie Zhu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 61 pages. Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide explicit formulas for quadratic Gauss sums over $\mathbb{Z}^n/c\mathbb{Z}^n$, which generalize some of the existing formulas, e.g., Skoruppa and Zagier's (for $n=2$), and Iwaniec and Kowalski's (for arbitrary $n$). We then give four main applications. As the first application, we prove a duality theorem, which relates a sum over a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}^n/c\mathbb{Z}^n$ to another sum over the orthogonal complement. This allows us to give explicit formulas for quadratic Gauss partial sums over certain subgroups. As the second application, we give an explicit formula for the coefficients of Weil representations of $\mathrm{Mp}_2(\mathbb{Z})$, which has the advantage, compared to Scheithauer's, Strömberg's, and Boylan and Skoruppa's formulas, that it involves neither local data nor limits of theta series. As the third application, we provide an explicit formula for the number of solutions of an arbitrary quadratic congruence in $n$ variables modulo a prime, as well as an efficient formula modulo a general integer. As the final application, we give a uniform formula for the number of solutions of the Diophantine equation $dxyz=Q(x,y,z)$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$, where $Q$ is an arbitrary integral quadratic form with some weak restrictions. This generalizes a result of Baragar regarding the Markoff equation. There is also a formula relating Hecke Gauss sums to sums over $\mathbb{Z}^n/c\mathbb{Z}^n$, an explicit formula for Hecke Gauss sums over quadratic fields, and an example of computing a Hecke Gauss sum over a cyclotomic field.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>About a century ago, P. A. MacMahon introduced a class of $q$-series, which are nowadays referred to as MacMahon series. More recently, in 2013, G. E. Andrews and S. C. F. Rose revealed the quasimodular property of these series. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of MacMahon series. Specifically, for any positive integers $t, k, N$ and a polynomial $Q(x)$, we define the series $\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}(Q; q)$ and $\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}^{\star}(Q; q)$ using the $N$-th cyclotomic polynomial. To investigate these series, we apply a decomposition formula involving the Eulerian polynomials and express the $N$-th roots of unity in terms of Gauss sums. By combining these results to derive explicit representations, we prove that our series arise as quasimodular forms of higher weight and higher level. Furthermore, we show that they can be expressed as isobaric polynomials. In particular, we show that the one-parameter generalization introduced by C. Nazaroglu, B. V. Pandey, and A. Singh arises as a special case of our theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the problem of finding integer triangles with $R/r$ a positive rational, where $R$ and $r$ are the radii of the circumcircle and an excircle, respectively. We show that for general triangles $R/r>1/4$ applies. The equation $R/r=N$ turns out to be related to the elliptic curve $\mathcal{E}_N$ given by $v^2=u^3+2(2N^2+2N-1)u^2-(4N-1)u$. If $N>1/4$ is rational, then the torsion group of $\mathcal{E}_N$ is $\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z\times\mathbb Z/6\mathbb Z$ if $N(N+2)$ is a square and $\mathbb Z/6\mathbb Z$ otherwise. We show that a rational triangle with rational ratio $R/r=N$ exists if and only if $N>1/4$ and there exists a rational non-torsion point on the curve $\mathcal{E}_N$ which satisfies a certain condition. Furthermore, we show that the rank of $\mathcal{E}_N$ is positive when $N = m^2 \pm 1>1/4$ for a rational $m$. We also show that on every curve $\mathcal{E}_N$ whose rank is positive, there are infinitely many rational points which lead to infinitely many non-similar integer triangles with $R/r=N$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The permutation matrices form a subgroup of $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ that is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_n$. Let $r_{μλ}$ denote the multiplicity of the irreducible representation $V_μ$ of $S_n$, corresponding to a partition $μ$ of $n$, in the restriction of an irreducible polynomial representation $W_λ(\mathbb{C})$ of $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$, corresponding to a partition $λ$ with at most $n$ parts. Finding a combinatorial interpretation for $r_{μλ}$ remains an open problem in algebraic combinatorics, called the \emph{restriction problem}. We derive a new nonrecursive expression for a character polynomial called the \emph{Specht polynomial} and use it to find a combinatorial interpretation of $r_{μλ}$ when $λ$ is a hook-shaped partition.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 64 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A result of Pyber states that every finite group $G$ contains an abelian subgroup whose order is quasi-polynomially large in $\lvert G\rvert$. We prove a similar result for $K$-approximate subgroups of solvable groups under only modest restrictions on $K$. We show that, if $A$ is a finite $K$-approximate group contained in some solvable group, then some abelian group intersects $A^4$ in at least $\exp(Ω(\log^{1/6}\lvert A\rvert/\log 2K))$ elements. We also prove a similar result for approximate subgroups of finite groups with no large alternating subquotients. Along the way, we obtain polynomial (instead of quasi-polynomial) bounds for the same statement of approximate subgroups of linear groups. We give two applications. Firstly, we consider the conjecture of Alon that every finite group $G$ admits a Cayley graph with clique number and independence number $O(\log\lvert G\rvert)$. Conlon, Fox, Pham, and Yepremyan have recently proven that, for almost all positive integers $N$, every abelian group of order $N$ satisfies Alon's conjecture. Extending their result, we verify Alon's conjecture for all (not necessarily abelian) groups of almost all orders. Secondly, we prove a "local" version of Roth's theorem in (many) non-abelian settings with quasi-polynomial bounds, using the recent breakthroughs of Kelley and Meka on Roth's theorem and of Jaber, Liu, Lovett, Ostuni, and Sawhney on the corners problem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that, up to scaling, there exist only finitely many isometry classes of Hermitian lattices over $O_E$ of signature $(1,n)$ that admit ball quotients of non-general type, where $n>12$ is even and $E=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-D})$ for an odd discriminant $-D<-3$. Furthermore, we show that even-dimensional ball quotients, associated with arithmetic subgroups of $\mathrm{U}(1,n)$ defined over $E$, are always of general type if $n > 207$, or $n>12$ and $D>2557$. To establish these results, we construct a nontrivial full-level cusp form of weight $n$ on the $n$-dimensional complex ball.

> **Comment:** 7 pages. Dedicated to the memory of Christine Bessenrodt

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Saxl's conjecture (2012) asserts that for the staircase partition $ρ_k = (k, k-1, \ldots, 1)$, the tensor square of the corresponding irreducible representation of the symmetric group $S_{T_k}$ contains every irreducible representation as a constituent, where $T_k = k(k+1)/2$ is the $k$th triangular number. We prove this conjecture unconditionally. Our proof introduces the Staircase Minimality Theorem: among all 2-regular partitions of $T_k$, the staircase $ρ_k$ is the unique dominance-minimal element. Combined with Ikenmeyer's theorem on dominance and Kronecker positivity for staircases, this establishes that every 2-regular partition appears in the tensor square. Modular saturation then follows using only the diagonal entries $d_{μμ} = 1$ of the decomposition matrix, and the Bessenrodt--Bowman--Sutton lifting theorem completes the proof. We further prove that at triangular numbers, staircases are the only Kronecker-universal self-conjugate partitions, providing a complete characterization.</p></details>

(ii) We give an explicit formula of Fourier coefficients of Jacobi-Eisenstein series of index $D_{2n+1}$. (iii) We construct a holomorphic modular form of weight $3/2$ of level $8$ from the Zagier Eisenstein series $\mathscr{F}$ of weight $3/2$ of level $4$. Moreover, we show that the four functions $E^*_2$, $η^3$, $θ^3$ and $\mathscr{F}$ have essentially the same Hecke eigenvalue $1+p$ for any odd prime $p$, where $E^*_2$ is the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series of weight $2$, $η$ is the Dedekind eta-function and $θ$ is the usual theta function.

Here the scaling factor $\frac{2π}{\log q}$ is the average spacing between consecutive low-lying zeros with height at most 1, say. We also obtain a lower bound on the proportion of $L$-functions whose first zero lies within a given multiple of the average spacing.

The construction of this $p$-adic $L$-function can be viewed as a higher-dimensional generalisation of the work of Bertolini--Darmon--Prasanna and Castella--Hsieh, and the inclusion of this extra variable arising from the $p$-adic iteration of differential operators will play a key role in relating values of this $p$-adic $L$-function to $p$-adic regulators of special cycles on unitary Shimura varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $γ= 0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $δ= 0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $γ+ δ/e = \mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $γ^{(n)} + δ^{(n)}/e = η^{(n)}$; $n \ge 0$ for sequences of constants $γ^{(n)}$, $δ^{(n)}$, and $η^{(n)}$ (given respectively by raw, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). Investigating the $γ^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations, we find that at least one of the pair {$γ,γ^{(2)}$} and at least two of each of the sets {$γ,γ^{(2)},γ^{(3)},γ^{(4)}$}, {$γ,γ^{(3)},γ^{(4)},\ldots,γ^{(6)}$}, and {$γ,γ^{(4)},γ^{(5)},\ldots,γ^{(8)}$} are transcendental, implying analogous results for the sequence $Γ^{(n)}(1)=\left(-1\right)^{n}γ^{\left(n\right)}$. We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $η^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent, and therefore transcendental, for all $n \ge 0$, implying that at least one of each pair, {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e$} and {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e,δ^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n \ge 1$. Further analysis of the $γ^{(n)}$ and $η^{(n)}$ reveals that the values $δ^{(n)}/e$ are transcendental infinitely often, with the density of the set of transcendental terms having asymptotic lower bound $1/2-o(1)$. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tildeδ^{(n)}$ and $\tildeη^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $γ^{(n)} + \tildeδ^{(n)}/e = \tildeη^{(n)}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the first part of the paper, we fix a non-CM elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ and an odd prime $\ell$ and investigate the distribution of invariants associated to the $\ell$-volcano containing the reduction $E_p$, as $p$ ranges over primes of good ordinary reduction. Let $H(p)$ be the height of the volcano and let $d'(p)$ denote the relative position of $j(E_p)$ above the floor, and let $r\ge 0$ be an integer. Assuming that the $\ell$-adic Galois representation attached to $E$ is surjective, we derive an explicit formula for the natural density of primes $p$ for which $H(p)=r$ (resp.\ $d'(p)=r$). In the non-surjective case, we show that all sufficiently large heights occur with positive density. In the second part of the paper, we analyze the distribution of $\ell$-volcano heights over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ and consider the limit as $q\to\infty$. Using analytic estimates for sums of Hurwitz class numbers in arithmetic progressions, we compute exact limiting densities for ordinary elliptic curves whose $\ell$-isogeny graph has a prescribed height $r$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The homology of free Lie algebras with coefficients in tensor products of the adjoint representation working over Q contains important information on the homological properties of polynomial outer functors on free groups. The latter category was introduced in joint work with Vespa, motivated by the study of higher Hochschild homology of wedges of circles. There is a splitting of this homology by polynomial degree (for polynomiality with respect to the generators of the free Lie algebra) and one can consider the polynomial degree relative to the number of tensor factors in the coefficients. It suffices to consider the Lie algebra homology in homological degree one; this vanishes in relative degree 0 and is readily calculated in relative degree 1. This paper calculates the homology in relative degree 2, which presents interesting features. This confirms a conjecture of Gadish and Hainaut.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 39 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider two algebraic invariants in the representation theory of quantized enveloping algebras: the dimension growth of simple modules for the De Concini-Kac quantum group at roots of unity, and the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of simple highest weight modules for the quantum group at generic $q$. In spite of being defined for different values of the parameter $q$, these invariants reflect closely related features in the respective contexts. We show that several new phenomena appear in the quantum case and the representations with non-integral weights contribute to both invariants in a way that cannot be ignored. Building on this, we determine the minimal non-zero value of these invariants for each Lie type. As an application we show that quantum cuspidal modules at generic $q$ can occur only when the underlying semisimple Lie algebra has simple components of type $A$, $B$, or $C$, providing a more explicit representation-theoretic distinction with the classical case.</p></details>

> **Comment:** We do not address the global open problem of non-trivial solutions to a^5+b^5=c^5+d^5 without linear constraints

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Diophantine equation $a^5+b^5=c^5+d^5$ under the linear slicing constraint $(c+d)-(a+b)=h$. We first establish the necessary modular constraint $30 \mid h$. For any nonzero slice $h$, the problem reduces to finding rational points on a genus-one fibration over $\mathbb{Q}(S)$. Passing to the Jacobian fibration $E_h/\mathbb{Q}(S)$, we identify a global rational $2$-torsion section and prove that $E_h$ never admits full rational $2$-torsion. This is achieved by reducing the splitting condition of the $2$-division field to finding rational points on a universal genus-two hyperelliptic curve, for which we rigorously verify the set of rational points using the method of Chabauty and Coleman. We further show that the Jacobian fibrations for all $h \neq 0$ are isomorphic over a rational function field. Focusing on the representative slice $h=30$, we compute the explicit invariants of the elliptic surface and apply the Gusić--Tadić injectivity criterion for the specialization homomorphism. Based on verified computations of specialized ranks, we establish the uniform upper bound $\mathrm{rank}\,E_h(\mathbb{Q}(S)) \le 1$ for all $h \neq 0$. Finally, we discuss the additional inequality and parity constraints required to recover integer solutions from the fibration.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 64 pages, 2 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the Hausdorff dimension of naturally occurring sets of inhomogeneous well-approximable points with a sequence of real invertible matrices $\mathcal{A}=(A_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$. Specifically, for a given point $\mathbf{y}\in [0,1)^d$ and a function $ψ: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}^+$, we study the limsup set $$ W\big(\mathcal{A},ψ,{\bf y}\big) =\Big\{\mathbf{x}\in [0,1)^d\colon A_n\mathbf{x}~(\bmod~1)\in B\big(\mathbf{y}, ψ(n)\big) {\rm ~ for~ infinitely ~many}~n\in\mathbb{N}\Big\}.$$ The upper and lower bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of $W\big(\mathcal{A},ψ,{\bf y}\big)$ are determined by involving the singular values of $A_n$ and the successive minima of the lattice $A_n^{-1}\mathbb{Z}^d$, and both bounds are shown to be attainable for some matrices. Within this framework, we unify the problem of shrinking target sets and recurrence sets, establishing the Hausdorff dimensions for such limsup sets. As applications, our corresponding upper bounds for shrinking target and recurrence sets essentially improve those appearing in the present literature. Furthermore, explicit Hausdorff dimension formulas are derived for shrinking targets and recurrence sets associated with concrete classes of matrices. We extend the Mass Transference Principle for rectangles of Li-Liao-Velani-Wang-Zorin (Adv. Math., 2025) to rectangles under local isometries. This generalization yields a general lower bound for the Hausdorff dimension of $W\big(\mathcal{A},ψ,{\bf y}\big)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 35 pages, revised version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use height arguments to prove two results about the dynamical Mordell-Lang problem. (i) For an endomorphism of a projective variety, the return set of a dense orbit into a curve is finite if any cohomological Lyapunov multiplier of any iteration is not an integer. (ii) Let $f\times g:X\times C\rightarrow X\times C$ be an endomorphism, where $f$ and $g$ are surjective endomorphisms of a projective variety $X$ and a projective curve $C$, respectively. If the degree of $g$ is greater than the first dynamical degree of $f$, then the return sets of the system $(X\times C,f\times g)$ have the same form as the return sets of the system $(X,f)$. Using the second result, we deal with the case of split self-maps of products of curves, for which the degrees of the factors are pairwise distinct. In the cases that the height argument cannot be applied, we find examples which show that the return set can be very complicated -- more complicated than experts once imagined -- even for endomorphisms of tori with zero entropy. One may compare them with the conjectures and results stated in [CGSZ21] and [XY25].</p></details>

The $m=2$ case is Euler's famous partition theorem. Recently, Andrews, Kumar, and Yee gave two new partition functions $C(n)$ and $D(n)$ related to Euler's theorem. Lin and Zhang extended their result to Glaisher's theorem by generalizing $C(n)$. We generalize $D(n)$, prove an analogous partition identity for the $m=3$ case, and show that the general case is an example of an almost partition identity. We also provide a new series equal to Glaisher's product both in the finite and infinite cases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian category with a torsion pair $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$. Happel-Reiten-Smalo tilting provides a method to construct a new abelian category $\mathcal{B}$ with a torsion pair associated to $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$, which is exactly the heart of a certain $t$-structure on the bounded derived category $D^b(\mathcal{A})$. In this paper, we mainly study generalized HRS tilting. We first show that an interval of torsion pairs in extriangulated categories with negative first extensions is bijectively associated with torsion pairs in the corresponding heart, which yields several new observations in triangulated categories. Then we obtain a generalization of HRS tilting by replacing hearts of $t$-structures with extended hearts. As an application, we show that certain $t$-structures on triangulated subcategories can be extended to $t$-structures on the whole triangulated categories.</p></details>

This notion extends $τ_{[d]}$-tilting pairs of extended finitely generated modules over finite-dimensional algebras to a broader framework, encompassing extended large modules over unitary rings as well as truncated subcategories of finite-dimensional derived categories of proper non-positive differential graded algebras. Within this framework, we establish a bijection between AIR tilting subcategories and silting subcategories. We further define quasi-tilting and tilting subcategories of extended hearts, generalizing the corresponding notions in module categories, and investigate their fundamental properties and the relationships among these three tilting-related concepts.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>$τ$-tilting theory can be thought of as a generalization of the classical tilting theory which allows mutations at any indecomposable summand of a support $τ$-tilting pair. Indeed, for any algebra $Λ$ its tilting modules $\text{tilt}\,Λ$ form a subposet of the support $τ$-tilting poset $\text{s}τ-\text{tilt}\,Λ$. We show that conversely the $τ$-tilting theory of an algebra $Λ$ can be naturally identified with the classical tilting theory of its duplicated algebra $\barΛ$ by establishing a poset isomorphism $\text{s}τ-\text{tilt}\,Λ\cong \text{tilt}\,\barΛ$. As a result, $τ$-tilting theory may be considered to be a special case of tilting theory. This extends the results of Assem-Brüstle-Schiffler-Todorov in the case of hereditary algebras. We also show that the product $\text{s}τ-\text{tilt}\,Λ\times \text{s}τ-\text{tilt}\,Λ$ embeds into the support $τ$-tilting poset of its duplicated algebra $\text{s}τ-\text{tilt}\,\barΛ$ as a collection of Bongartz intervals.

Here we obtain a generalization modulo prime powers $p^m$ by giving an expression for $G_k\pmod{p^m}$ in terms of modular forms of weight at most $mp$. As an application we extend a recent result of the first author with Hanson, Raum and Richter by showing that, modulo powers of $E_{p-1}$, every such Eisenstein series is congruent modulo $p^m$ to a modular form of weight at most $mp$. We prove a similar result for the normalized Eisenstein series $E_k$ in the case that $(p-1)\mid k$ and $m<p$.</p></details>

By combining it with Arratia's coupling, recently refined by Koukoulopoulos and the author, we present a general strategy to reduce the problem of finding an asymptotic formula for the number of integers whose prime factorization falls into any given subset of $\ell^1(\mathbb R)$, to finding upper bounds for two key probabilities measuring proximity to the boundary of the subset in question. We apply this strategy to give an asymptotic formula for counting integers in $[1, x]$ that have a divisor in an interval $(y, z)$ with $z/y \to \infty$ as $x \to \infty$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cut and project sets are obtained by projecting an irrational slice through a lattice to a lower dimensional subspace. Under standard conditions, the resulting pattern has no translational periods even though it retains some regularity of the lattice. Cut and project sets are one of the archetypical examples of patterns featuring aperiodic order, the other construction methods being by substitution and matching rules. Many early examples of aperiodic tilings, including the famous Penrose and Ammann--Beenker tilings, have a description from all of these methods. In this article we answer the following question, in the case of a Euclidean total space: what property of the cut and project data characterises when the resulting cut and project sets may also be defined by a substitution rule?</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The seminal paper "J.T. Stafford, Module structure of Weyl algebras, J. London Math. Soc. (2) 18 (1978), no. 3, 429--442" was a major step forward in our understanding of Weyl algebras. Beginning with Serre's Theorem on free summands of projective modules and Bass' Stable Range Theorem in commutative algebra, we attempt to trace the origins of this work and explain how it led to Stafford's construction of non-holonomic simple modules over Weyl algebras. We also describe Bernstein-Lunt's geometric construction of infinite families of non-holonomic simple modules. We recall more recent developments related to Weyl algebras, especially that of parametrizing right ideals in the first Weyl algebra and its relation to Calogero-Moser spaces. Finally, we revisit Stafford's results in the context of quantized symplectic singularities, where they lead naturally to open problems on the behaviour of simple modules.</p></details>

Readers interested in the results of this paper may also look at the recent preprint arXiv:2511.09459, joint with Fouvry, which contains generalizations of the main results to much larger classes of trace functions

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove non-trivial bounds for bilinear forms with hyper-Kloosterman sums with characters modulo a prime $q$ which, for both variables of length $M$, are non-trivial as soon as $M\geq q^{3/8+δ}$ for any $δ>0$. This range, which matches Burgess's range, is identical with the best results previously known only for simpler exponentials of monomials. The proof combines refinements of the analytic tools from our previous paper and new geometric methods. The key geometric idea is a comparison statement that shows that even when the "sum-product" sheaves that appear in the analysis fail to be irreducible, their decomposition reflects that of the "input" sheaves, except for parameters in a high-codimension subset. This property is proved by a subtle interplay between étale cohomology in its algebraic and diophantine incarnations. We prove a first application concerning the first moment of a family of $L$-functions of degree $3$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider multiple zeta values, which are periods of mixed Tate motives over $\mathbb Z$. For a given multiple zeta value $ζ$, there exists a unique minimal motive $M(ζ)$ such that $ζ$ is a period of $M(ζ)$. In general, the motive $M(ζ)$ is difficult to compute. In this article, we compute the minimal motive $M(a,b)$ associated to a given double zeta value $ζ(a,b)$. We also compute the motivic Galois group $G(a,b)$ associated to $ζ(a,b)$ and discuss its dimension. Moreover, we give a period matrix of $M(a,b)$. The period conjecture predicts that the dimension of $G(a,b)$ equals the transcendence degree of the algebra of periods of $M(a,b)$. Hence our results lead to conjectures about algebraic relations between single and double zeta values.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $N$ be normal subgroup of a finite group $G$, $p$ be a prime, $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ and $θ$ be a $P$-invariant irreducible character of $N$. Suppose that $G/N$ is a $p$-solvable group. In this note we show that, whenever a finite group $A$ acts on $G$ stabilizing $P$, there exists an $A$-equivariant McKay bijection between irreducible characters lying over $θ$ of degree prime to $p$ of $G$ and $\textbf{N}_G(P)$. This is a consequence of a recent result of D. Rossi. Our approach here is independent from Rossi's and follows the original idea of the proof of the McKay conjecture for $p$-solvable groups. In particular, we rely on the so-called Okuyama-Wajima argument to deal with characters above Glauberman correspondents. For this purpose, we generalize a classical result of P. X. Gallagher on the number of irreducible characters of $G$ lying over $θ$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A filtration of the morphisms of the $k$-linearization $k \mathbf{FS}$ of the category $\mathbf{FS}$ of finite sets and surjections is constructed using a natural $k \mathbf{FI}^{op}$-module structure induced by restriction, where $\mathbf{FI}$ is the category of finite sets and injections. In particular, this yields the `primitive' subcategory $ k \mathbf{FS}^0 \subset k \mathbf{FS}$ that is of independent interest; for example, the category of $k \mathbf{FS}^0$-modules is closely related to the category of $k \mathbf{FA}$-modules, where $\mathbf{FA}$ is the category of finite sets and all maps. Working over a field of characteristic zero, the subquotients of this filtration are identified as bimodules over $k \mathbf{FB}$, where $\mathbf{FB}$ is the category of finite sets and bijections, also exhibiting and exploiting additional structure. In particular, this describes the underlying $k \mathbf{FB}$-bimodule of $k \mathbf{FS}^0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Positional numeration systems are a large family of numeration systems used to represent natural numbers. Whether the set of all representations forms a regular language or not is one of the most important questions that can be asked of such a system. This question was investigated in a 1998 article by Hollander. Central to his analysis is a property linking positional numeration systems and Rényi numeration systems, which use a real base to represent real numbers. However, this link only exists when the initial numeration system has a dominant root, which is not a necessary condition for regularity. In this article, we show a more general link between positional numeration systems and alternate base numeration systems, a family generalizing Rényi systems. We then take advantage of this link to provide a full characterization of those numeration systems that generate a regular language. We also discuss the effectiveness of our method, and comment Hollander's results and conjecture in the light of ours.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present `liesuperalg` a SageMath package for representation-theoretic calculations involving Lie superalgebras in Type A. Our package introduces functionality to calculate invariants of weights and produce the associated cup diagrams. We expose functionality to calculate characters of irreducible representations, work with combinatorics of generalized Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, and determine composition factor multiplicities of indecomposable modules. Our package implements an algorithm to decompose arbitrary modules in terms of irreducible ones in the Grothendeick group of Lie superalgebra representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present methods to compute Selmer groups associated to mod p Galois representations rho over a number field K, with a particular focus on comparing their ranks with periods coming from cohomology classes associated to rho by Serre's conjecture. This provides evidence for a loose version of a "mod p Bloch-Kato conjecture", where the vanishing of a period is predicted to capture the presence of rank in a Selmer group. Our methods are explicit, and implemented in Magma.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a class of multiple Legendre polynomials and prove that they satisfy an Apéry-like recurrence. We give new upper bounds of the approximation measures of logarithms of rational numbers by algebraic numbers of bounded degree. We prove e.g. that the nonquadraticity exponent of $\log 2$ is bounded from above by $12.841618...$, thus improving upon a recent result of the author. Our construction also yields some other known results.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The equation commonly known as Sury's identity is a deceptively simple summation formula that connects the Lucas numbers, Fibonacci numbers, and powers of two. Many authors have given extensions and generalizations over the years; in this paper, we take a different approach that allows us to produce a good number of new summation formulas, all from elementary (but non-trivial) methods.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the analogue of Malle's conjecture for the global function field $\F_q(t)$ with $q$ sufficiently large, including a precise formula for the leading constant. The main ingredients are the recent breakthrough of Landesman--Levy on the stable homology of Hurwitz spaces, a novel interpretation of the Frobenius fixed components of Hurwitz spaces in terms of the Brauer group of the stack $BG$ and an interpretation of the number of $\F_q$ points of configuration spaces as a certain Tamagawa volume.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07855v3'>2403.07855</a>\]&nbsp; **On t-structures adjacent and orthogonal to weight structures**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Mikhail V. Bondarko &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.KT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Section 2.1 was extended significantly

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study $t$-structures (on triangulated categories) that are closely related to weight structures. A $t$-structure couple $t=(C_{t\le 0},C_{t\ge 0})$ is said to be adjacent to a weight structure $w=(C_{w\le 0}, C_{w\ge 0})$ if $C_{t\ge 0}=C_{w\ge 0}$. For a category $C$ that satisfies the Brown representability property we prove that $t$ that is adjacent to $w$ exists if and only if $w$ is smashing (that is, "respects C-coproducts"). The heart $Ht$ of this $t$ is the category of those functors $Hw^{op}\to Ab$ that respect products (here $Hw$ is the heart of $w$); the result has important applications. We prove several more statements on constructing $t$-structures starting from weight structures; we look for a strictly orthogonal $t$-structure $t$ on some $C'$ (where $C,C'$ are triangulated subcategories of a common $D$) such that $C'_{t\le 0}$ (resp. $C'_{t\ge 0}$) is characterized by the vanishing of morphisms from $C_{w\ge 1}$ (resp. $C_{w\le -1}$). Some of these results generalize properties of semi-orthogonal decompositions proved in the previous paper, and can be applied to various derived categories of (quasi)coherent sheaves on a scheme $X$ that is projective over an affine noetherian one. We also study hearts of orthogonal $t$-structures and their restrictions, and prove some statements on "reconstructing" weight structures from orthogonal $t$-structures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For two relatively prime positive integers $a, b\in \mathbb{N}$, it is known that exactly one of the two Diophantine equations $$ax + by \ =\ \frac{(a-1)(b-1)}{2}\ \mbox{ and }\ 1 + ax + by \ =\ \frac{(a-1)(b-1)}{2}$$ has a nonnegative integral solution $(x, y)$. Furthermore, the solution is unique. In this note, we summarize recent results and some new ones on the solution of the two equations and provide an overview of problems for future investigation, some of which were presented at the 2025 International Conference on Class Groups of Number Fields and Related Topics.</p></details>
