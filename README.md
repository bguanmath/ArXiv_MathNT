### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16213v2'>2601.16213</a>\]&nbsp; **Gauge Theory and Skein Modules**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Du Pei &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** hep-th &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study skein modules of 3-manifolds by embedding them into the Hilbert spaces of 4d ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theories. When the 3-manifold has reduced holonomy, we present an algorithm to determine the dimension and the list of generators of the skein module with a general gauge group. The analysis uses a deformation preserving ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry to express the dimension as a sum over nilpotent orbits in its Lie algebra. We find that the dimensions often differ between Langlands-dual pairs beyond the A-series, for which we provide a physical explanation involving chiral symmetry breaking and 't Hooft operators. We also relate our results to the structure of $\mathbb{C}^*$-fixed loci in the moduli space of Higgs bundles. This approach helps to clarify the relation between the gauge-theoretic framework of Kapustin and Witten with other versions of the geometric Langlands program, explains why the dimensions of skein modules do not exhibit a TQFT-like behavior, and provides a physical interpretation of the skein-valued curve counting of Ekholm and Shende.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gérald Tenenbaum &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $P^-(n)$ denote the smallest prime factor of a natural integer $n>1$. Furthermore let $μ$ and $ω$ denote respectively the Möbius function and the number of distinct prime factors function. We show that, given any set ${\scr P}$ of prime numbers with a natural density, we have $\sum_{P^-(n)\in \scr P}μ(n)ω(n)/n=0$ and provide a effective estimate for the rate of convergence. This extends a recent result of Alladi and Johnson, who considered the case when ${\scr P}$ is an arithmetic progression.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Špela Špenko, Michel Van den Bergh &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Referee comments implemented; updated GKZ funding acknowledgement

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Perverse schobers are categorifications of perverse sheaves. In prior work we constructed a perverse schober on a partial compactification of the stringy Kähler moduli space (SKMS) associated by Halpern-Leistner and Sam to a quasi-symmetric representation of a reductive group. When the group is a torus the SKMS corresponds to the complement of the GKZ discriminant locus (which is a hyperplane arrangement in the quasi-symmetric case shown by Kite). We show here that a suitable variation of the perverse schober we constructed provides a categorification of the associated GKZ hypergeometric system in the case of non-resonant parameters. As an intermediate result we give a description of the monodromy of such "quasi-symmetric" GKZ hypergeometric systems.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Simone Costa &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.PR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** This manuscript provides a substantial revision and a significant refocusing of the earlier preprint arXiv:2308.04284. The current version removes the applications to sequenceability to prioritize the development of anticoncentration inequalities in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and provides a more detailed comparison with the existing literature

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we investigate the probability distribution of the sum $Y$ of $\ell$ independent identically distributed random variables taking values in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Our main focus is the regime of small values of $\ell$, which is less explored compared to the asymptotic case $\ell \to \infty$. Starting with the case $\ell=3$, we prove that if the distributions of the $Y_i$ are uniformly bounded by $λ< 1$ and $p > 2/λ$, then there exists a constant $C_{3,λ} < 1$ such that $$ \max_{x \in \mathbb{Z}_p} \mathbb{P}[Y = x] \leq C_{3,λ}λ. $$ Moreover, when the distributions are uniformly separated from $1$, the constant $C_{3,λ}$ can be made explicit. By iterating this argument, we obtain effective anticoncentration bounds for larger values of $\ell$, yielding nontrivial estimates already in small and moderate regimes where asymptotic results do not apply.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 24 pages. Extended main result. Final version to appear in J. Lond. Math. Soc

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the sign of the Euler characteristic of an $S$-arithmetic subgroup of a simple algebraic group depends on the $S$-congruence completion only, except possibly in type ${}^6 D_4$. Consequently, the sign is a profinite invariant for such $S$-arithmetic groups with the congruence subgroup property. This generalizes previous work of the first author with Kionke--Raimbault--Sauer.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 36 pages; added new results and corrected typos

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by the question of defining a $p$-adic string worldsheet action in genus one, we define a Laplacian operator on the Tate curve, and study its Green's function. We show that the Green's function exists. We provide an explicit formula for the Green's function, which turns out to be a non-Archimedean counterpart of the Archimedean Green's function on a flat torus. In particular, it turns out that this Green's function recovers the Néron local height function for the Tate curve in the $p\to\infty$ limit, when the $j$-invariant has odd valuation. So this non-Archimedean height function now acquires a physics meaning in terms of the large $p$ limit of a non-Archimedean conformal field theory two point function on the Tate curve, as well as a direct analytic interpretation as a Green's function, on the same footing as in the Archimedean place.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Littlewood conjecture, proven by Konyagin and McGehee-Pigno-Smith in the 1980s, states that if $A\subset \mathbb{Z}$ is a finite set of integers with $\lvert A\rvert=N$ then $\| \widehat{1_A}\|_1\geq c\log N$ for some absolute constant $c > 0$. We explore what structure $A$ must have if $\| \widehat{1_A}\|_1\leq K\log N$ for some constant $K$. Under such an assumption we prove, for instance, that $A$ contains a subset $A'\subseteq A$ with $\lvert A\rvert \geq N^{0.99}$ such that $\lvert A'+A'\rvert \ll K^{O(1)}\lvert A'\rvert$. As a consequence, for any $k\geq 3$, if $N$ is sufficiently large depending on $k$ and $K$, then $A$ must contain an arithmetic progression of length $k$. A byproduct of our analysis is a (slightly) improved bound for the constant $c$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gebhard Böckle, Chun-Yin Hui &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\{ρ_λ:G_K\rightarrow GL_n(\overline E_λ)\}$ be a semisimple E-rational compatible system of a number field K. In a first step, building upon the theory of pseudocharacters [Ro96],[Ch14], we attach to each $ρ_λ$ an algebraic monodromy group $G_λ$ defined over $E_λ$ and also prove that the compatible system can be descended to a strongly E'-rational compatible system $\{ρ_{λ'}: G_K\rightarrow GL_n(E'_{λ'})\}$ for some finite extension E'/E. Secondly, we demonstrate that the maximal potentially abelian quotient of $G_λ$ is independent of $λ$ in a strong sense. Finally, as an application, we generalize a result of Patrikis--Snowden--Wiles on residual irreducibility of compatible systems.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 27 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use Hensel minimality, a non-Archimedean analog of o-minimality, to study several questions around transcendental number theory, unlikely intersections, and differential fields in a non-Archimedean setting. In particular, we focus on $p$-adic exponentiation and Tate uniformization on $\mathbb{C}_p$, which we show live in a Hensel minimal structure on $\mathbb{C}_p$. We start by constructing a large collection of derivations on Hensel minimal fields that respect definable functions, which we then apply to the $p$-adic Schanuel conjecture. We also study properties of local definability in analogy to work of Wilkie, and show that $p$-adic Schanuel implies a uniform version of itself. For Tate uniformization we show a strong closure property when blurring, and deduce that $\mathbb{C}_p$ with the blurred Tate uniformization is quasiminimal. Finally, we prove a result on $p$-adic density of likely intersections for powers of elliptic curves.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 40p

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the character of an irreducible cuspidal representation of $GL_n(\mathbb{F}_{\ell}((t)))$ is locally bounded up to a logarithmic factor by the orbital integral of a matrix coefficient of this representation. The characteristic $0$ analog of this result is part of the proof of the celebrated Harish-Chandra's integrability theorem. In a sequel work [AGKS] we use this result in order to prove a positive characteristic analog of Harish-Chandra's integrability theorem under some additional assumptions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The celebrated Harish-Chandra's integrability theorem states that the distributional character of an irreducible smooth representation of a p-adic group $G(F)$ is integrable, that is represented by an $L^1_{loc}(G(F))$ function. Here $F$ is a non-Archimedean local field of characteristic $0$ and $G$ is a reductive algebraic group defined over $F$. In this paper we focus on cuspidal representations of $GL_n(F)$ for a field $F$ of positive characteristic. We show that in this case the integrability holds under the hypothesis of existence of desingularization of (certain) algebraic varieties in positive characteristics. Furthermore, in the case $char(F)>n/2$ we establish the regularity of such characters unconditionally.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Avraham Aizenbud, Dmitry Gourevitch, David Kazhdan, Eitan Sayag &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 50p

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove dimension bounds on the jet schemes of the variety of nilpotent matrices (and of related varieties) in positive characteristic. This result has applications to the analytic properties of the Chevalley map that sends a matrix to its characteristic polynomial. We show that our dimension bound implies, under the assumption of existence of resolution of singularities in positive characteristic, that the Chevalley map pushes a smooth compactly supported measure to a measure whose density function is $L^t$ for any $t<\infty$. We also prove this analytic property of the Chevalley map, unconditionally, when the characteristic of the field exceeds $n/2$. The zero characteristic counterpart of this result is an important step in the proof of the celebrated Harish-Chandra's integrability theorem. In a sequel work [AGKSb], we show that also in positive characteristic, this analytic statement implies Harish-Chandra's integrability theorem for cuspidal representations of the general linear group.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2->v3

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As a natural sequel to the study of A-motivic cohomology initiated in "On the integral part of A-motivic cohomology", we develop a notion of regulator for rigid analytically trivial Anderson A-motives. In accordance with the conjectural picture over number fields, we define it as the morphism at the level of extension modules induced by the exactness of the Hodge-Pink realization functor. The purpose of this article is twofold: first, we prove a finiteness result for A-motivic cohomology; second, under a weight assumption, we show that the source and the target of the regulator have the same dimension. It came as a surprise to the author that the image of this regulator may fail to have full rank, thereby preventing an analogue of Beilinson's celebrated conjecture from holding in our setting.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $ψ$ be a continuous decreasing function defined on all large positive real numbers. We say that a real $m\times n$ matrix $A$ is $ψ$-Dirichlet if for every sufficiently large real number $t$ one can find $\mathbf{p} \in \mathbb{Z}^m$, $\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{Z}^n\setminus\{\mathbf{0}\}$ satisfying $\|A\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{p}\|^m< ψ(t)$ and $\|\mathbf{q}\|^n<t$. By removing a technical condition from a partial zero-one law proved by Kleinbock-Strömbergsson-Yu, we prove a zero-one law for the Lebesgue measure of the set of $ψ$-Dirichlet matrices provided that $ψ(t)<1/t$ and $tψ(t)$ is increasing. In fact, we prove the zero-one law in a more general situation with the monotonicity assumption on $tψ(t)$ replaced by a weaker condition. Our proof follows the dynamical approach of Kleinbock-Strömbergsson-Yu in reducing the question to a shrinking target problem in the space of lattices. The key new ingredient is a family of carefully chosen subsets of the shrinking targets studied by Kleinbock-Strömbergsson-Yu, together with a short-range mixing estimate for the associated hitting events. Our method also works for the analogous weighted problem where the relevant supremum norms are replaced by certain weighted quasi-norms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the generating series of the number of pairs of geodesics on a compact Shimura curve with given discriminants and intersection angle are coefficients of a non-holomorphic Siegel modular form, a theta lift of the constant function. This retrieves and generalizes counting results of Rickards via the Siegel-Weil formula. More generally, we study the genus two theta lift of Maass forms on this Shimura curve and prove a Fourier-Taylor expansion in terms of some generalized Whittaker functions. We also provide a geometric interpretation of all Fourier coefficients of these theta lifts in terms of averages of geodesic Taylor coefficients over special cycles.</p></details>

In the case of Eisenstein series for $ Γ(N) $, these generalized Dedekind sums admit trigonometric sum expressions, which coincide with the formula for the $ \mathrm{SU}(2) $-TQFT signature. Furthermore, we express both the $ \mathrm{SU}(2) $-TQFT and generalized Dedekind sums as radial limits of Eichler integrals.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove conjectures of Zamolodchikov and Belavin-Belavin in Liouville conformal field theory (CFT), which are generalisations of the celebrated Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov equations known as the higher equations of motion. Algebraically, these equations give examples of non-zero singular states in Virasoro modules, which is a relatively rare phenomenon in the physical study of CFT. In probability theory, these equations and their variants have been instrumental in the rigorous derivation of the structure constants of Liouville CFT in the unit disc. The proof builds on a previous work of ours studying the analytic continuation of the Poisson operator of Liouville theory. The main novelty is that this operator admits poles on the Kac table, and the higher equations of motions are obtained via a residue computation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For fixed positive integers $n,m$, let $\mathrm{Mat}_{n\times m}(\mathbb{C})$ be the affine space consisting of all $n\times m$ complex matrices, and let $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n\times m}]$ be its coordinate ring. For $0\le r\le\min\{m,n\}$, we apply the orbit harmonics method to the finite matrix loci $\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r}$ of rook placements with exactly $r$ rooks, yielding a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n\times\mathfrak{S}_m$-module $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We find one signed and two sign-free graded character formulae for $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We also exhibit some applications of these formulae, such as proving a concise presentation of $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$, and proving some module injections and isomorphisms. Some of our techniques are still valid for involution matrix loci.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study Fourier-Mukai equivalences of (families of) abelian varieties and K3 surfaces in positive and mixed characteristics. We first prove in any characteristics that Fourier-Mukai partners of abelian varieties are again abelian varieties. We subsequently focus on the canonical lifts of ordinary abelian varieties and ordinary K3 surfaces. For such schemes, we show that Fourier-Mukai equivalences on the special fibers can be lifted to the canonical lifts. We also prove that the relative Fourier-Mukai partners of the canonical lifts are in bijection with the Fourier-Mukai partners of the special fibers. We conclude by demonstrating that the last result can be used to recover the ordinary case of a result originally proved by Honigs, Lombardi and Tirabassi.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study constraints imposed by four-dimensional unitarity (formalised as graded unitarity in recent work by the first author) on possible ${\mathcal W}_3$ vertex algebras arising from four-dimensions via the SCFT/VOA correspondence. Under the assumption that the $\mathfrak{R}$-filtration is a weight-based filtration with respect to the usual strong generators of the vertex algebra, we demonstrate that all values of the central charge other than those of the $(3,q+4)$ minimal models are incompatible with four-dimensional unitarity. These algebras are precisely the ones that are realised by performing principal Drinfel'd--Sokolov reduction to boundary-admissible $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ affine current algebras; those affine algebras were singled out by a similar graded unitarity analysis in \cite{ArabiArdehali:2025fad}. Furthermore, these particular vertex algebras are known to be associated with the $(A_2,A_q)$ Argyres--Douglas theories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We interpret the structure of the adele class space of the rationals--and specifically its Riemann sector--as the natural monoidal extension of the Picard group of the arithmetic curve $\overline{\mathrm{Spec} \mathbb Z}$. We identify the elements of this space with torsion-free rank-1 abelian groups $L$ endowed with rigidifying data. In the Riemann sector, this data corresponds to a norm, extending the classical notion of metrized line bundles in Arakelov geometry. For the full adele class space, we replace the norm with a group morphism to $\mathbb R$ and a combinatorial datum: a parametrization of the roots of unity associated with the character dual of $L$. We show that the product of adeles is represented geometrically by the tensor product of these rank-1 groups and their rigidifying structures. The resulting monoid space generalizes the Picard group to the full adelic context by incorporating the singular strata required for the spectral realization of $L$-functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the lattice $\mathbf{tors}(A)$ of torsion pairs in the category $\mathrm{mod}(A)$ of finitely generated modules over an artinian ring $A$. It was shown by the authors in previous work that $\mathbf{tors}(A)$ is isomorphic to a lattice formed by certain closed sets, called maximal rigid, in the Ziegler spectrum of the unbounded derived category $\mathrm{D}(A)$ of $A$. Moreover, the structure of this lattice is described by an operation on maximal rigid sets which encompasses (the dual of) silting mutation. In this paper we provide an explicit description of this operation and we discuss how it is reflected in the lattice $\mathbf{tors}(A)$. We establish a bijection between the wide intervals in $\mathbf{tors}(A)$ and the closed rigid sets in the Ziegler spectrum of $\mathrm{D}(A)$. Moreover, we show that the arrows in the Hasse quiver of $\mathbf{tors}(A)$ correspond to the closed rigid sets that are almost complete, or equivalently, that can be completed to a maximal rigid set in exactly two ways. Our results are most interesting in the case when $A$ is a finite dimensional algebra. In fact, we generalise results by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten, with an important difference: not every point in a maximal rigid set is mutable. We use the topology on the Ziegler spectrum to determine the mutable points. In the last section of the paper we illustrate our results by the example of a finite dimensional algebra arising from a triangulation of an annulus.</p></details>

They announced that the multilinear component on $3n-2$ generators decomposes as a direct sum of two irreducible symmetric group representations and a proof was given recently in a subsequent paper by Friedmann, Hanlon and Wachs.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is devoted to the theory of $GL_n({\mathbb Z})$-conjugacy classes of regular integer $n\times n$ matrices. Such a matrix is $GL_n({\mathbb Q})$-conjugate to the companion matrix of its characteristic polynomial. But the set of $GL_n({\mathbb Z})$-conjugacy classes of regular integer matrices with a fixed characteristic polynomial $f$ is usually nontrivial (finite if $f$ has simple roots, infinite if $f$ has multiple roots). It is in 1:1-correspondence to a subsemigroup of a certain quotient semigroup of the commutative semigroup of full lattices in the algebra ${\mathbb Q}[t]/(f)$. In its first part, the paper gives a survey on old and new results on full lattices and orders in a finite dimensional commutative ${\mathbb Q}$-algebra with unit element and on induced semigroups. In its longer second part, the paper applies this theory to many examples, essentially all cases with $n=2$, many cases with $n=3$ and two cases with arbitrary $n$, the case with $n$ different integer eigenvalues and the case of a single $n\times n$ Jordan block.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a stability theory for minimal projective resolutions of $\mathbf{P}$-modules, where $\mathbf{P}$ is a finite metric poset. On the module side, we introduce the \emph{Galois transport distance}, defined by factoring two modules through a common ``apex'' poset via pairs of Galois insertions and measuring the maximal displacement in the index poset. This construction generalizes the interleaving distance in both the classical one-parameter and multiparameter settings, and yields an extended metric on isomorphism classes of $\mathbf{P}$-modules. On the homological side, we define a bottleneck distance between minimal projective resolutions by matching indecomposable projectives degreewise, with contractible cones playing the role of diagonal terms. Our main theorem shows that this resolution-level bottleneck distance is always bounded above by the Galois transport distance, providing a metric stability result formulated entirely at the level of modules and their minimal projective resolutions. We then treat persistence as an application. Passing to the interval poset and a kernel construction, we interpret persistence diagrams as minimal projective resolutions of kernel modules and obtain a corresponding stability inequality. In the one-parameter case this recovers classical bottleneck stability, while in the multiparameter setting it extends naturally to signed diagrams arising from minimal projective resolutions. Via a general relationship between minimal projective resolutions and Möbius inversion, these results can be interpreted as a stability theorem for Möbius homology, while remaining entirely phrased in the language of projective resolutions.</p></details>

We establish a new proof of the $1/4$ bound towards the Ramanujan conjecture for the trace of the cuspidal part in the ramified case, which is also provided by adapting Altuğ's original approach. The proof proceeds in three stages: First, we estimate the contributions from the non-elliptic parts of the trace formula. Then, we apply the main result from our the previous work to isolate the $1$-dimensional representations within the elliptic part.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates the construction of space-filling designs for computer experiments. The space-filling property is characterized by the covering and separation radii of a design, which are integrated through the unified criterion of quasi-uniformity. We focus on a special class of designs, known as quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) lattice point sets, and propose two construction algorithms. The first algorithm generates rank-1 lattice point sets as an approximation of quasi-uniform Kronecker sequences, where the generating vector is determined explicitly. As a byproduct of our analysis, we prove that this explicit point set achieves an isotropic discrepancy of $O(N^{-1/d})$. The second algorithm utilizes Korobov lattice point sets, employing the Lenstra--Lenstra--Lovász (LLL) basis reduction algorithm to identify the generating vector that ensures quasi-uniformity. Numerical experiments are provided to validate our theoretical claims regarding quasi-uniformity. Furthermore, we conduct empirical comparisons between various QMC point sets in the context of Gaussian process regression, showcasing the efficacy of the proposed designs for computer experiments.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In [GL24], Galashin and Lam discovered that when $k$ and $n$ are coprime, the proportion of subspaces in $\mathrm{Gr}(k,n)(\mathbb{F}_q)$ that lie in the top-dimensional open positroid variety $Π_{k,n}^\circ(\mathbb{F}_q)$ is $|(\mathbb{F}_q^\times)^n|/|\mathbb{F}_{q^n}^\times|$. In this paper, I recover this point count identity by relating the split torus action on $(Π_{k,n}^\circ)_{\mathbb{F}_q}$ and an anisotropic torus action on a $\mathbb{F}_q$ rational form of $Π_{k,n}^\circ$. The main step in the point count argument and the main technical result in this paper is that cyclic rotation acts trivially on the torus-equivariant cohomology of $Π_{k,n}^\circ$ when $k$ and $n$ are coprime.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Theorems about reductive groups and applications concerning cohomology and the associated local systems are added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study finite-rank left-translation invariant algebraic $D$-modules on complex affine algebraic groups. Using the standard description of these objects as left-invariant flat algebraic connections on the trivial vector bundle, modulo algebraic gauge transformations, we recast the classification problem as an explicit moduli problem for constant connections. We prove our main results for semisimple groups, for general linear groups, and more generally for connected reductive groups. For a connected semisimple complex algebraic group, invariant $D$-modules are classified by representations of the finite central kernel of the simply connected cover. For a general linear group, every invariant $D$-module is obtained by pullback along the determinant map, reducing the classification to the one-dimensional torus case. For a connected reductive group, we relate invariant $D$-modules via pullback along the abelianization map. We also derive applications concerning cohomology and the associated local systems for semisimple groups.</p></details>

We show that $$ \liminf_N \Expectation_{n\in [N]} m(A\cap T^{-k_n} A \cap \cdots \cap T^{-\ell k_n} A )>0. $$ This is an extension of the IP Ergodic Theorem of Furstenberg and Katznelson, and a partial extension of recent work of Kra and Shalom. In particular, this implies that for any subset of integers $A$ of positive upper Banach density, there is a set $B$ of integers $n$ of positive lower Banach density such that $A$ contains an $\ell+1$ term progression, with step size $k_n$, where $n\in B$. This is a complement to recent results of Kra and Shalom, for IP Sets of integers, and Burgin, concerning Sarkozy's Theorem for Primes with restricted digits.</p></details>

Previous work showed that exactly one equation has a nonnegative solution, and the solution is unique. Our first result gives criteria to determine which equation is used for a given pair $(a,b)$. We then use the criteria to study the sequence of equations used by the pair $(a_n/\gcd{(a_n, a_{n+1})}, a_{n+1}/\gcd{(a_n, a_{n+1})})$ from several special sequences $(a_n)_{n\geq 1}$. Finally, fixing $k \in \mathbb{N}$, we investigate the periodicity of the sequence of equations used by the pair $(k/\gcd{(k, n)}, n/\gcd{(k, n)})$ as $n$ increases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study congruences modulo powers of a prime $p$ between pairs of $p$-new modular Hecke eigenforms of level $Γ_0(p)$ and same weight $k$. Based on explicit computations, we conjecture that every such eigenform $f$ admits a twin to which it is congruent modulo a surprisingly high power of $p$, whose exponent is close to the opposite of the valuation of the $\mathcal L$-invariant of $f$, and whose Atkin--Lehner sign is opposite to that of $f$. This is a new phenomenon that is not explained by the known results on the $p$-adic variation of eigenforms. Inspired by the global picture, we formulate a local conjecture describing congruences between semistable representations of fixed weight, varying $\mathcal L$-invariant, and opposite Atkin--Lehner signs. We give some theoretical evidence towards our conjectures.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 27 pages. No figures. Part of a six-paper series on Algebraic Phase Theory

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop the representation theory intrinsic to Algebraic Phase Theory (APT) in regimes where defect and canonical filtration admit faithful algebraic realisation. This extends the framework introduced in earlier work by incorporating a representation-theoretic layer that is compatible with defect and filtration. In this setting, algebraic phases act naturally on filtered module categories rather than on isolated objects, and classical irreducibility must be replaced by a filtration-compatible notion of indecomposability forced by defect. As a central application, we analyse the Frobenius Heisenberg algebraic phase, which occupies a rigid boundary regime within the broader APT landscape, and show that it satisfies the axioms of APT in a strongly admissible form. We study the representations realising this phase and show that their non-semisimplicity and rigidity properties are consequences of the underlying algebraic structure rather than analytic or semisimple hypotheses. In particular, we establish a Stone von Neumann type rigidity theorem for Heisenberg groups associated with finite Frobenius rings. For each such ring $R$, we construct a canonical Schrödinger representation of the Frobenius Heisenberg group $H_R$, and show that, for a fixed nontrivial central character, every centrally faithful representation of $H_R$ is equivalent to this model. The proof is entirely algebraic and uses no topology, unitarity, Fourier analysis, or semisimplicity. Instead, rigidity emerges as a boundary phenomenon governed by defect and canonical filtration. The Frobenius hypothesis is shown to be sharp: it precisely delineates the structural boundary within APT at which Heisenberg rigidity persists, and outside the Frobenius class this rigidity necessarily fails.</p></details>

In the case of an algebraic number field the top part of a certain quotient semigroup is the class group.

It studies the commutative semigroup of full lattices in such an algebra and also the quotient semigroup. This leads in this commutative, but not separable situation to a certain extension of the Jordan-Zassenhaus theorem. One application concerns $GL_n({\mathbb Z})$-conjugacy classes of regular integer $n\times n$ matrices.</p></details>

Almost all important classes of orbits and characters studied to the moment can be uniformly described as the orbits and characters associated with so-called orthogonal rook placements. In the paper, we construct a semi-direct decomposition for the corresponding irreducible characters in the spirit of the Mackey little group method.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Relatively little is known about the arithmetic properties of Gamma-function derivatives evaluated at arbitrary points $q\in\mathbb{Q}\setminus\mathbb{Z}_{\leq0}$. In recent work, we showed that the sequence $\left\{ Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(1\right)\right\}_{n\geq1}$ contains transcendental elements infinitely often. That result is now generalized to all sequences $\left\{Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(q\right)\right\}_{n\geq1}$ for $q\in\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}\setminus\mathbb{Z}_{\leq0}$. Moreover, for all such $q$ we derive a lower bound, $β\left(N\right)=\max\left\{0,\sqrt{N}-5/2\right\}/N$, for the density of transcendental elements $Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(q\right)$ among $n\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,N\right\}$. For $q\in\mathbb{Q}\setminus\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}$, we find the somewhat weaker result that at least one of the sequences $\left\{Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(q\right)\right\}_{n\geq1}$, $\left\{Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(1-q\right)\right\}_{n\geq1}$ contains infinitely many transcendental elements.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The asymptotics of relative characters for real Lie groups were studied for representations $(π, σ)$ arising from Gan-Gross-Prasad pairs $(G,H)$ by Nelson and Venkatesh. They successfully compute the asymptotics of relative characters whenever the conductor of the associated Rankin-Selberg $L$-function $L(π\boxtimes σ^\vee)$ lies in a stable locus, i.e. away from conductor dropping. In this paper, we express asymptotics for relative characters in the non-archimedean setting for $(\mathrm{PGL}_2, \mathrm{GL}_1)$. The key new innovation is that our method overcomes the stability hypothesis and allows for significant conductor dropping.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We complete the classification of torsion subgroups $E(K)_{\text{tors}}$ that can occur for an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ over a sextic number field $K$. Previous work determined the complete set of these groups, leaving the existence of only one group in question: $C_3 \oplus C_{18}$. We prove that this group does not occur. Our proof relies on the theory of Galois representations attached to elliptic curves. The assumed existence of a $C_3 \oplus C_{18}$ torsion subgroup would impose strong, simultaneous constraints on the mod-$2$ and $3$-adic Galois representations of the curve. By applying the recent classification of $\ell$-adic Galois images for elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$, we translate these arithmetic constraints into a problem of Diophantine geometry: the $j$-invariant of such a curve must correspond to a rational point on one of the finitely many modular curves. We then analyze these curves using classical methods and show that none have the necessary rational points corresponding to elliptic curves without complex multiplication, thereby proving our main result.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article proposes a unified analytical approach leading to a partial resolution of the Erdos-Straus, Sierpinski conjectures, and their generalization. We introduce an equivalent reformulation of these conjectures while constructing two new explicit analytical formulas. The first formula, which is a special case of the second, is based on a divisibility condition, whereas the second, more general formula, relies on the existence of a perfect square, which we conjecture to always hold. Under these conditions, the formulas verify the conjectures even for very large numerical values. Moreover, our method reduces the problem to the search for a suitable perfect square, thereby opening the way to a complete proof of these conjectures. In conclusion, we present open questions and conjectures to the mathematical community regarding the generalization of these formulas.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the triple convolution sum of the generalised divisor functions $$\sum_{n\leq x} d_k(n+h)d_l(n)d_m(n-h),$$ where $h \le x^{1-ε}$ for any $ε>0$ and $d_k(n)$ denotes the generalised divisor function which counts the number of ways $n$ can be written as a product of $k$ many positive integers. The purpose of this paper is three-fold. Firstly, we note a predicted asymptotic estimate for the above sum, where the constant appearing in the estimate can be obtained from the theory of Dirichlet series of several complex variables and also using some probabilistic arguments. Then we show that a lower bound of the correct order can be derived using the several variable Tauberian theorems, where, more importantly, the constant in the predicted asymptotic can be recovered. Lastly, in the spirit of the Titchmarsh divisor problem, we consider this triple convolution sum over the prime numbers, which essentially leads to a shifted convolution sum. We use the Tauberian theory of multiple Dirichlet series along with the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem to derive an explicit lower bound of this.</p></details>

> **Comment:** There is a gap in the proof of Theorem 3.1

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite-dimensional algebra Λ, we establish an explicit bijection between widely generated torsion(-free) classes and semibricks in mod Λ. Using the kappa order on the lattice of torsion classes with canonical join representations, we provide several equivalent conditions for brick-finite algebras. We show that Λ is brick-finite if and only if any chain of wide subcategories of mod Λ becomes eventually constant, if and only if any torsion class in mod Λ has finitely many covers, if and only if every semibrick in mod Λ is a finite set. Thus, we give a proof of Enomoto's conjecture (Adv. Math., 393 (2021), 108113). As a consequence, we show that Λ is brick-finite if and only if every wide subcategory closed under coproducts of Mod Λ is closed under products, if and only if every wide subcategory of mod Λ is functorially finite. This gives a positive answer to the question posed by Angeleri Hügel and Sentieri (J. Algebra, 664 (2025), 164-205).</p></details>

The main setting has changed over to flat vector bundles. This involved many changes. Part 2 is still available at ArXiv:2009.11127. Furthermore, we generalized the premise of the main theorem to include a subexponential growth condition on singular values

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $N$ be a manifold of dimension $m$ with a flat vector bundle given by a representation $ρ:π_1(N) \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbf{R})$ where $π_1(N)$ is finitely generated. The holonomy group $ρ$ is a $k$-partially hyperbolic holonomy representation if the flat bundle pulled back over the unit tangent bundle of a sufficiently large compact submanifold of $N$ splits into expanding, neutral, and contracting subbundles along the geodesic flow, where the expanding and contracting subbundles are $k$-dimensional with $k < n/2$. Suppose that each element of $ρ(π_1(N))$ has an eigenvalue of norm $1$, or, alternatively, $ρ$ has some singular values of subexponential growth in terms of word length. We show that $ρ$ is a $P$-Anosov representation for a parabolic subgroup $P$ of $\mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbf{R})$ if and only if $ρ$ is a partially hyperbolic representation. We are going to primarily employ representation theory techniques. As an application, we will show that the equivalence holds when $N$ is a complete affine $n$-manifold, and $ρ$ is a linear part of the holonomy representation. This had never been done over the full general linear group.</p></details>

We show that a quandle $Q$ and its image in the enveloping group $G(Q)$ have isomorphic enveloping groups. The image quandle is injective. For $Q$ a finite quandle, we show that $G(Q)$ admits a faithfull representation $ρ: G(Q)\to GL_n(\mathbb{Z})$ for some $n$; an irreducible representation of $G(Q)$ over $\mathbb{C}$ is finite dimensional an its degree divides the order of the group $Inn(Q)$ of inner automorphism of $Q$ and is bounded by $\sqrt{\vert Inn(Q) \vert }$. We determine the Malcev Lie algebra and the rational cohomology ring of $G(Q)$ for $Q$ finite. We prove that a finite injective quandle is a subquandle (for conjugacy) of a finite group. We also prove that the only finite subquandles (for conjugacy) of uniquely divisible groups are trivial quandles and that morphisms from quandles to nilpotent groups (for conjugacy) are constant on the indecomposable components. Implication of these results are considered.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study the so-called {\it weakly $\sqrt{J}U$ rings} (hereafter abbreviated as {\it $W\sqrt{J}U$ rings} for short), in which every unit is of the form $j+1$ or $j-1$ for some $j$ in $\sqrt{J(R)} : = \{x \in R : x^n \in J(R) \text{ for some } n\ge 1\}$. This class of rings non-trivially generalizes the classes of $\sqrt{J}U$, $UU$, $JU$, $WUU$ and $WJU$ rings, respectively. We investigate their basic properties showing that they are Dedekind-finite, that $M_n(R)$ is never $W\sqrt{J}U$ for $n\ge 2$, and that when $\mathrm{char}(R)>0$ it must be equal to $2^α3^β$ for some $α, β\in \mathbb{N} \cup \left\{ 0 \right\}$. Moreover, for group rings $RG$, we prove that if $RG$ is $W\sqrt{J}U$, then $R$ is $W\sqrt{J}U$ and $G$ is a torsion group. In addition, when $R$ has positive characteristic and $G$ is a locally finite $p$-group, we give a complete characterization like this: $RG$ is a $W\sqrt{J}U$ ring if, and only if, either $R$ is a $\sqrt{J}U$ ring and $G$ is a $2$-group, or $R$ is a $W\sqrt{J}U$ ring with $3\in J(R)$ and $G$ is a $3$-group, or $R\cong R_1\times R_2$ with $R_1$ a $\sqrt{J}U$ ring, $R_2$ a $W\sqrt{J}U$ ring and $G$ a trivial group. Our results substantially improve on recent achievements due to Saini and Udar in Czech. Math. J. (2025).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The monograph develops a self-contained, mathematically rigorous framework for massless representations of the conformal group U(2,2) and their restriction to the de Sitter group Sp(2,2). It systematically constructs ladder (massless) representations, computes invariant bilinear forms and Casimir operators, and provides explicit constructions of vertex operators and two-point functions for low-helicity fields. The monograph employs a novel Clifford-split-octonion approach, embedding 8-component Majorana spinors within an alternative composition algebra, which allows for fully explicit algebraic, spinorial, and geometric constructions. The text bridges foundational representation theory, explicit computational methods, and physical applications in quantum field theory and cosmology. While targeted at researchers in mathematical physics, quantum cosmology, and quantum field theory, the exposition is pedagogically structured to guide advanced graduate students through subtle algebraic and representation-theoretic ideas, making complex constructions accessible without sacrificing rigor.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>While the value of the radius of convergence of the generating series of the Catalan numbers is well-known, obtaining it solely from recurrence relations is less immediate. It is sometimes considered that no known proof establishes that the radius $R$ equals 1/4 without relying on the explicit closed formula for the Catalan numbers. In particular, it has been shown that one can obtain, at the cost of substantial technical effort and without resorting to the main Segner recursion relation or to the explicit formula for the Catalan number, the lower bound $R\geq 1/6$. In this work, we prove that Touchard's recurrence alone yields the optimal exponential upper bound $\limsup_{n\to\infty} C_n^{1/n} \le 4$, which implies $R \ge 1/4$. Combined with the classical lower estimate $\limsup_{n\to\infty} C_n^{1/n} \ge 4$, obtained from central binomial coefficients, this gives $R = 1/4$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: cleverref issue solved

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Initiated in work by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten, the area known as $τ$-tilting theory plays a fundamental role in contemporary representation theory. In this paper we explore a higher-dimensional analogue of this theory, formulated with respect to the higher Auslander-Reiten translation $τ_d$. In particular, we associate to any functorially finite $d$-torsion class a maximal $τ_d$-rigid pair and a $(d+1)$-term silting complex. In the case $d=1$, the notions of maximal $τ_d$-rigid and support $τ$-tilting pairs coincide, and our theory recovers the classical bijections. However, the proof strategies for $d>1$ differ significantly. As an intermediate step, we prove that a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of a module category induces a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of the category of $(d+1)$-term complexes, producing novel examples of $d$-exact categories. We introduce the notion of a $d$-torsion class in the exact setup, and use this to obtain the aforementioned $(d+1)$-term silting complex. We moreover apply our theory to study $d$-APR tilting modules and slices. To illustrate our results, we provide explicit combinatorial descriptions of maximal $τ_d$-rigid pairs and $(d+1)$-term silting complexes for higher Auslander and higher Nakayama algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The equivalence classes of irreducible representations of wreath product $\mathfrak{S}_n(T) = T^n \rtimes \mathfrak{S}_n$ of finite group $T$ with respect to symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ are parametrized by $\mathbb{Y}_n(\widehat{T})$, the $\lvert \widehat{T}\rvert$-tuple Young diagrams with total size $n$. We show a formula connecting the Kerov transition measures of these Young diagrams with the Jucys--Murphy elements of $\mathfrak{S}_n(T)$. This formula is due to Biane in the case of symmetric groups. The formula enables us to investigate asymptotic property of the shapes of multi-diagrams through combinatorial analysis for the Jucys--Murphy elements. On the other hand, a Markov chain is introduced on $\mathbb{Y}_n(\widehat{T})$, canonically reflecting the branching rule for the tower of wreath product groups. We have a continuous time stochastic process on $\mathbb{Y}_n(\widehat{T})$ from this chain by replacing the discrete time by a counting process. Our project is to specify the deterministic limit shape of multi-diagrams at each macroscopic time through appropriate space-time scaling limit, and to describe evolution of related quantities characterizing the shape. Especially, we derive dynamical concentrated limit shapes in the case of abelian $T$ by using free probability tools under the assumption of approximate factorization property for initial ensembles with an additional property of a pausing time distribution.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the irreducibility of 6-dimensional strictly compatible systems of Q with distinct Hodge-Tate weights. We prove that if one of the representations $ρ$ in such a system is irreducible and satisfies a self-dual condition $ρ^{\vee}\otimesχ\congρ$ for some character $χ$, then all but finitely many of them are irreducible.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a class of functions that behave like classical Eisenstein series in many ways, but with a key distinction: only their non-holomorphic completions transform like (quasi)modular forms. We show how the partition rank generating function can be expressed in terms of partition traces of these functions. A key feature of our construction is that the completions satisfy a holomorphic anomaly equation - a phenomenon typically seen in the context of quantum field theory and string theory. We also show that the Fourier coefficients of these Eisenstein-type series are integral.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we construct two families of generalized Nahm sums of arbitrary rank $r\geq 2$ with the symmetrizers ${\rm diag} ({2,\ldots, 2},1)_{r\times r}$. Specifically, the cases corresponding to $r = 2$ and $r = 3$ of these two families have been previously demonstrated by Mizuno, Warnaar, and B. Wang-L. Wang. Additionally, we establish a family of Rogers-Ramanujan type identities associated with the index $({1,\ldots, 1},2)_{r\times r}$ for any rank $r\geq 2$. Building upon these three families, combined with another family of generalized Nahm sums (with the symmetrizers ${\rm diag} ({1,\ldots, 1},2)_{r\times r}$) established by B. Wang and L. Wang, we construct two vector-valued automorphic forms, one of which is a vector-valued modular function when $r$ is odd.</p></details>
