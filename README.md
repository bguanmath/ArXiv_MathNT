 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** S. Sriram, A. David Christopher &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $n$ and $t$ be positive integers with $t\geq 2$. Let $R_t(n)$ be the number of $t$-regular partitions of $n$. A class of functions, denoted $\tau_k(n)$, is defined as follows: $$q\prod_{m=1}^{\infty}(1-q^m)^k=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\tau_k(n)q^n, $$ where $k$ is an integer. We express $\tau_k(n)$ as a binomial coefficient weighted partition sum. Consequently, we obtain congruence identities that relate $\tau_k(n)$, $R_t(n)$ and partition function weighted composition sums.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kevin Gomez &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We attach Hecke polynomials $P_n(F;x)$ to weak Hecke eigenforms $F$ of weight $2-k$ and show that, for large $n$, every zero is simple, lies in $[0,1728]$, and the zeros equidistribute on this interval. The construction pulls back a weakly holomorphic Hecke combination of $F$ along $j$; the analysis follows Hecke orbits on the unit-circle arc $\mathcal{A}$, isolating a dominant "cosine" term and controlling the tail via Maass-Poincar\'e series and Whittaker/Bessel bounds. This extends the Rankin--Swinnerton-Dyer/Asai--Kaneko--Ninomiya picture from holomorphic forms to a broad class of harmonic Maass forms and yields a clean degree-monicity formula and simple criteria for zeros at $0$ and $1728$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Syu Kato &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** v2, 57 pages. Extensively revised; notation has been updated to align with arXiv:2301.00862, with many additional details and examples. The proof of Theorem 7.1 (prepared through \S5--6) is now more direct. We have also added \S1.1 and expanded \S9--10. Another round of revisions is expected before journal submission. Comments are most welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We characterize the $k$-Schur functions as the graded characters of simple objects in an additive module category. This confirms a set of conjectures formulated in the Ph.D. thesis of Chen, written under the direction of Mark Haiman, and thereby establishes the algebraic framework proposed therein. As a consequence, we deduce that the modified Macdonald polynomials are $k$-Schur positive, thus realizing the original motivation behind the definition of the $k$-Schur functions by Lapointe, Lascoux, and Morse. Our approach builds on our previous work on the algebraic and geometric realization of Catalan symmetric functions, which encompasses both the $k$-Schur functions and the Hall--Littlewood functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Nicolas inequality we deal can be written as \begin{equation}\label{Nicineq} e^\gamma \log\log N_x < \dfrac{N_x}{\varphi(N_x)}\,, \end{equation} where $x\ge 2$, $N_x$ denotes the product of the primes less or equal than $x$, $\gamma$ is the Euler constant and $\varphi$ is the Euler totient function. We see that verification of such an inequality depends on the sign of the Big-o function in the Mertens estimate for the sum of reciprocals of primes that. Then we analyze the sign of such an error term.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Starting with a primitive Dirichlet character of conductor $N$, we construct a paramodular Siegel Eisenstein series of level $N^2$ and weight $k\geq4$. We calculate the Fourier expansion of the holomorphic Siegel modular form thus constructed. The function is a paramodular newform, and its adelization generates an irreducible automorphic representation.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Completely re-written. Grading convention changed, enriched notation, error corrected in some examples and new example in cohomology

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we generalize the Tits construction for Lie superalgebras such that $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ acts by even derivations and decompose, as $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-module, into a direct sum of copies of the adjoint, the natural and the trivial representations. This construction generalizes the one provided by Elduque et al in \cite{EBCC23}, and it is possible to described the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-Lie superstructure in terms of $\mathcal{J}$-ternary superalgebras as a super version of the defined by Allison. We extend the Tits-Kantor-Koecher construction and the Tits-Allison-Gao functor that define a short $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-Lie superalgebra from a $\mathcal{J}$-ternary superalgebra $(\mathcal{J},\mathcal{M})$. Our setting includes and generalizes both \cite{EBCC23} and Shang's \cite{S22}.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Xiaogang Li, Changchang Xi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 29 pages. It contains some results on derived equivalences in arXiv:2312.08794. New results are about the finitistic dimension conjecture and the Nakayama conjecture

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Centralizer matrix algebras were investigated initially by Georg Ferdinand Frobenius in the Crelle's Journal around 1877. By introducing three new equivalence relations on all square matrices over a field, we completely characterize Morita, derived and almost $\nu$-stable derived equivalences between centralizer matrix algebras in terms of these matrix equivalences, respectively. Thus the categorical equivalences are reduced to matrix equivalences in linear algebra. Further, we show that a derived equivalence between centralizer matrix algebras of permutation matrices induces both a Morita equivalence and additional derived equivalences for $p$-regular parts and for $p$-singular parts. As applications, we show that the finitistic dimension conjecture and Nakayama conjecture are valid for centralizer matrix algebras.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26297v1'>2509.26297</a>\]&nbsp; **Polynomials and asymptotic constants in a resurgent problem from 't Hooft**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** David Broadhurst &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 6 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent study of the quantum theory of harmonic oscillators, Gerard 't Hooft proposed the following problem: given $G(z)=\sum_{n>0}\sqrt{n}z^n$ for $|z|<1$, find its analytic continuation for $|z|\ge1$, excluding a branch-cut $z\in[1,\,\infty)$. A solution is provided by the bilateral convergent sum $G(z)=\frac12\sqrt{\pi}\sum_{n\in{\mathbb Z}}(2n\pi{\rm i}-\log(z))^{-3/2}$. On the negative real axis, $G(-e^u)$ has a sign-constant asymptotic expansion in $1/u^2$, for large positive $u$. Optimal truncation leaves exponentially suppressed terms in an asymptotic expansion $e^{-u}\sum_{k\ge0}P_k(x)/u^k$, with $P_0(x)=x-\frac23$ and $P_k(x)$ of degree $2k+1$ evaluated at $x=u/2-\lfloor u/2\rfloor$. These polynomials become excellent approximations to sinusoids. The amplitude of $P_k(x)$ increases factorially with $k$ and its phase increases linearly, with $P_k(x)\sim\sin((2k+1)C-2\pi x) R^{2k+1}\Gamma(k+\frac12)/\sqrt{2\pi}$, where $C\approx1.0688539158679530121571$ and $R\approx0.5181839789815558726739$ are asymptotic constants that have been determined at 100-digit precision. Their exact values remain to be identified. This work combines results from David C. Woods, on fractional polylogarithms, with evaluations of Hurwitz zeta values by Pari/GP.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Pierre-Emmanuel Caprace, Max Carter &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 26 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We address the type I dichotomy for two-step nilpotent locally compact groups. Invoking work of Baggett-Kleppner, we characterize the closed points of the unitary dual of such a group $G$ purely in terms of the group structure. An algebraic criterion characterizing when $G$ is a type I group is derived. We show that this criterion automatically holds if $G$ is a central extension of vector groups over a non-discrete locally compact field $k$ such that the commutator map is $k$-bilinear. As an application, we show that the unipotent radicals of minimal parabolics in simple algebraic groups of $k$-rank one are type I groups. We also discuss the type I dichotomy for $p$-torsion contraction groups, and exhibit, for each prime $p$, uncountably many pairwise non-isomorphic such groups that are not type I. This answers a recently posed question by the second author. Finally, we adapt a recent construction of Chirvasitu to obtain numerous examples of two-step nilpotent torsion locally compact groups that are not type I, but that embed as closed cocompact normal subgroups in two-step nilpotent groups that are type I.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 39 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Jensen, Su, and Yang described the projective indecomposable modules of the $0$-Schur algebra $\mathbf{S}_0(n,r)$ using its geometric realization. In this paper, the simple modules of $\mathbf{S}_0(n,r)$ are identified by computing the tops of the projective indecomposable modules. Furthermore, functorial relations among the module categories $\mathbf{H}_r(0)$\textsf{-mod}, $\mathbf{S}_0(n,r)$\textsf{-mod}, and $U_0(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$\textsf{-mod} are examined, where $\mathbf{H}_r(0)$ denotes the $0$-Hecke algebra and $U_0(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ denotes the degenerate quantum group.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yinchong Song &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** We changed the title of the paper, and add one more chapter about parametrization of Beilinson--Bloch heights

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $ S $ be a quasi-projective smooth variety over complex field $ \mathbb{C} $. For a smooth projective morphism $ \pi:X\to S $, we will introduce a new height pairing \begin{align*} CH^p_{\hom}(X/S) \times CH^q_{\hom}(X/S) \to \widetilde{\mathrm{Pic}}(S) \end{align*} with $ \widetilde{\mathrm{Pic}}(S) $ the group of geometric adelic line bundles in the sense of Yuan--Zhang. It essentially parametrizes the asymptotic height pairing introduced by Brosnan and Pearlstein. We will show that this asymptotic height pairing coincides with Beilinson--Bloch pairing under certain conditions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We settle 22 conjectures of Cohen about cyclic numbers (positive integers $n$ with $\gcd(n,\varphi(n))=1$), proving 17 and disproving 5, and we completely resolve a related OEIS problem about sequences whose running averages are Fibonacci numbers. Highlights include: asymptotics for cyclics between consecutive squares with a second-order term (Conj.~9), Legendre- and $k$-fold Oppermann-type results in short quadratic intervals (Conj.~6, Conj.~20, and twin cyclics between cubes, Conj.~32), a Firoozbakht-type conjecture and a companion form (Conj. ~41, ~42), gap and growth analogs (Visser, Rosser, Ishikawa, and a sum-3-versus-sum-2 inequality; Conj.~47,~52,~54,~56), limiting ratios (Vrba and Hassani; Conj.~60,~61), and structure results for Sophie Germain cyclics (Conj.~36,~37). On the negative side we exhibit counterexamples to the Panaitopol, Dusart, and Carneiro analogs (Conj.~59,~53,~50--51). Finally, for the lexicographically least sequence of pairwise distinct positive integers whose running averages are Fibonacci numbers (\seqnum{A248982}), we give explicit closed forms for all $n$ and prove Fried's Conjecture~2 asserting the disjointness of the parity-defined value sets (equivalently, $F_{n+2}+2nF_{n+1}$ is never a Fibonacci number). All proofs in the paper were assisted by GPT-5.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Suhyoung Choi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 22 pages. This paper generalizes Part 1 of "Complete affine manifolds with Anosov holonomy groups,'' ArXiv:2009.11127, and Part 2 is dropped. The main setting has changed over to flat vector bundles. This involved many changes. Part 2 is still available at ArXiv:2009.11127

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $N$ be a manifold of dimension $m$ with a flat vector bundle given by a representation $\rho:\pi_1(N) \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbf{R})$ where $\pi_1(N)$ is finitely generated. The holonomy group $\rho$ is a $k$-partially hyperbolic holonomy representation if the flat bundle pulled back over the unit tangent bundle of a sufficiently large compact submanifold of $N$ splits into expanding, neutral, and contracting subbundles along the geodesic flow, where the expanding and contracting subbundles are $k$-dimensional with $k < n/2$. Suppose that each element of $\rho(\pi_1(N))$ has an eigenvalue of norm $1$, or, alternatively, each element of it has a singular value that is uniformly bounded above and below. We show that $\rho$ is a $P$-Anosov representation for a parabolic subgroup $P$ of $\mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbf{R})$ if and only if $\rho$ is a partially hyperbolic representation. We are going to primarily employ representation theory techniques. As an application, we will show this holds when $N$ is a complete affine $n$-manifold and $\rho$ is a linear part of the holonomy representation. This had never been done over the full general linear group.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Daniel Barrera Salazar, Andrew Graham, Chris Williams &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Corrected some typos/inaccuracies. The main results are unchanged

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove exceptional zero conjectures for $p$-ordinary regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{A})$ which are Steinberg at $p$. We make no self-duality assumptions. The paper has two parts. In Part 1, we use $p$-arithmetic cohomology to unconditionally prove an automorphic exceptional zero conjecture in this setting, using Gehrmann's automorphic $\mathcal{L}$-invariant. In Part 2 we prove, under mild assumptions that are expected to always hold, the equality of automorphic and Fontaine--Mazur $\mathcal{L}$-invariants, and thus deduce cases of the full Greenberg--Benois exceptional zero conjecture. As one of the key ingredients for this, we establish local-global compatibility at $\ell = p$ for Galois representations attached to $p$-ordinary torsion classes for $\mathrm{GL}_n$, confirming a conjecture of Hansen in this setting. We prove this for all $n$ following the strategy in the "10-author paper", and use the $n=3$ case to deduce the desired equality of $\mathcal{L}$-invariants.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 50 pages; Example 7.5 corrected

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is an introduction to cluster algebras and their common triangular bases. These bases are Kazhdan-Lusztig-type and serve as the canonical bases of cluster algebras from the representation-theoretic point of view. We review seeds associated with signed words, cluster operations (freezing and base change), the extension technique from finite to infinite rank, which are convenient tools to study these algebras and their bases. We present recent results on the topic and provide examples. An appendix collects detailed examples of some cluster algebras from Lie theory, including those from Lie groups and representations of quantum affine algebras.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Elie Studnia &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 64 pages (improved writing, simplified some arguments); comments welcome !

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We say that two elliptic curves $E$ and $F$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ are congruent modulo a prime $p$ if their $p$-torsion Galois modules (over the algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Q}$) are isomorphic. Such a congruence is called trivial if there is a rational isogeny between $E$ and $F$ with degree prime to $p$. A version of the Frey-Mazur conjecture states that any congruence modulo any prime $p \geq 19$ is trivial. Given an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ and a prime $p$, it is well-known that there is a twist of the classical modular curve $X(p)$ whose rational points describe the elliptic curves congruent to $E$ modulo $p$. In this article, we apply Mazur's strategy to determine the rational points of such a twisted modular curve under certain assumptions. This involves, among others, the determination of the previously unknown Tate module of its Jacobian and new instances of the Birch and Swinnerton--Dyer conjecture (for abelian varieties not of $\mathrm{GL}_2$-type). In particular, we determine an explicit bound on the conductor of any elliptic curve congruent modulo $p$ to $y^2=x^3-p$ when $p$ is prime and congruent to $5$ modulo $9$, and deduce that any congruence modulo $23$ to $y^2=x^3-23$ is trivial.</p></details>

Vector Spaces coming from $p$-adic pro-\'etale cohomology of smooth partially proper rigid analytic varieties are examples of sheaves belonging to the former category.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Over a composition algebra $A$, a polynomial $f(x) \in A[x]$ has a root $\alpha$ if and only $f(x)=g(x)\cdot (x-\alpha)$ for some $g(x) \in A[x]$. We examine whether this is true for general Cayley-Dickson algebras. The conclusion is that it is when $f(x)$ is linear or monic quadratic, but it is false in general. Similar questions about the connections between $f$ and its companion $C_f(x)=f(x)\cdot \overline{f(x)}$ are studied. Finally, we compute the left eigenvalues of $2\times 2$ octonion matrices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a finite, abelian, CM extension $H/F$ of a totally real number field $F$, and construct a $\mathbb{Z}_p[[G(H_\infty/F)]]-$module $\nabla_S^T(H_\infty)_p$, where $p>2$ is a prime and $H_\infty$ is the cyclotomic $\Bbb Z_p$-extension of $H$. This is the Iwasawa theoretic analogue of a module introduced by Ritter and Weiss in \cite{Ritter-Weiss} and studied further by Dasgupta and Kakde in \cite{Dasgupta-Kakde}. Our main result states that the $\Bbb Z_p[[G(H_\infty/F]]^-$-module $\nabla_S^T(H_\infty)_p$ is of projective dimension $1$, is quadratically presented, and that its Fitting ideal is principal, generated by an equivariant $p$-adic $L$-function $\Theta_S^T(H_\infty/F)$. As a first application, we compute the Fitting ideal of an arithmetically interesting $\Bbb Z_p[[G(H_\infty/F)]]^-$-module $X_S^{T,-}$, which is a variant of the classical unramified Iwasawa module $X$ (the Galois group of the maximal abelian, unramified, pro-$p$ extension of $H_\infty$), extending earlier results of Greither-Kataoka-Kurihara \cite{Greither-Kataoka-Kurihara}. These are all instances of what is now called an Equivariant Main Conjecture in the Iwasawa theory of totally real number fields, and refine the classical main conjecture, proved by Wiles in \cite{wiles}. As a final application, we give a short, Iwasawa theoretic proof of the minus $p$-part of the far-reaching Equivariant Tamagawa Number Conjecture for the Artin motive $h_{H/F}$, for all primes $p>2$, a result also obtained, independently and with different (Euler system) methods, by Bullack-Burns-Daoud-Seo \cite{Bullach-Burns-Daoud-Seo} and Dasgupta-Kakde-Silliman \cite{Dasgupta-Kakde-Silliman-ETNC}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that Shimura varieties and geometric period images satisfy a $p$-adic extension property for large enough primes $p$. More precisely, let $\mathsf{D}^{\times}\subset \mathsf{D}$ denote the inclusion of the closed punctured unit disc in the closed unit disc. Let $X$ be either a Shimura variety or a geometric period image with torsion-free level structure. Let $F$ be a discretely valued $p$-adic field containing the number field of definition of $X$, where $p$ is a large enough prime. Then, any rigid-analytic map $f: (\mathsf{D}^{\times})^a \times \mathsf{D}^b \rightarrow X_F^{\textrm{an}}$ defined over $F$ whose image intersects the good reduction locus of $X_F^{\textrm{an}}$ (with respect to an integral canonical model) extends to a map $\mathsf{D}^{a+b}\rightarrow X_F^{\textrm{an}}$. We note that this hypothesis is vacuous if $X$ is proper. We also deduce an application to algebraicity of rigid-analytic maps. Our methods also apply to the more general situation of the rigid generic fiber of formal schemes admitting Fontaine-Laffaile modules which satisfy certain positivity conditions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By a theorem of Edrei, an infinite, normalised totally nonnegative upper-triangular Toeplitz matrices is determined by a pair of nonnegative parameter sequences, the `Schoenberg parameters', where nonzero parameters correspond to the roots and poles of a naturally associated generating function. These totally nonnegative Toeplitz matrices and their parameters also arise in the classification of characters of the infinite symmetric group by later work of Thoma. Moreover the Schoenberg parameters have an asymptotic interpretation in terms of irreducible representations of S_n and their Young diagrams by Vershik-Kerov. In this article we consider infinite totally positive Toeplitz matrices as limits of finite ones, and we obtain two further asymptotic descriptions of the Schoenberg parameters that are now related to quantum cohomology of the flag variety as n goes to infinity. One is related to asymptotics of normalised quantum parameters, and the other to asymptotics of the Chern classes of the tautological line bundles. We also describe the asymptotics of (quantum) Schubert classes in terms of the Schoenberg parameters. Our limit formulas relate to and were motivated by a tropical analogue of this theory that we survey. In the tropical setting one finds an asymptotic relationship between the `tropical Schoenberg parameters' and the weight map from Lusztig's parametrisation of the canonical basis.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a natural enlargement of the BGG Category O for a semisimple Lie algebra: the category of weight modules with trivial central character and finite-dimensional weight spaces supported on the root lattice. We give a geometric realization of this category as unipotently monodromic sheaves on the flag variety satisfying a singular support condition. We then explain that a derived version $\mathcal{D}$ of this category is Koszul dual to the Kazhdan-Laumon Category O, a different enlargement of the BGG Category O obtained from a gluing construction for sheaves on the flag variety. This characterizes $\mathcal{D}$ as the category of algebras over a natural monad on a direct sum of copies of the derived Category O. These results give new interpretations of certain classical algebraic constructions of weight modules over semisimple Lie algebras due to Fernando and Mathieu. We also conjecture that our results fit naturally into a proposed Koszul duality relating the small quantum group and the semi-infinite flag variety to the geometry of affine Springer fibers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a Witt--Hadamard calculus for Euler products that unifies the classical Gauss congruences with their modern refinement, the Dold congruences. Within this framework we prove \emph{norm descent}: Dold congruences are functorial under finite extensions and preserved by prime--ideal norms $N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}$, yielding integer ghosts from algebraic ones. We extend the theory from $\mathbb{Z}$ to Dedekind domains, and show that integrality is stable under both Hadamard and Witt products. Two rigidity theorems lie at the core: a \emph{cyclotomic residues theorem}, asserting that if the logarithmic derivative has only cyclotomic poles then integrality forces rationality; and a stronger \emph{Dold$^{+}$ rigidity theorem}, showing that any algebraic series satisfying refined Dold congruences is necessarily rational. These results sharpen the Gauss--Dold picture: ordinary congruences enforce integrality, while the strengthened form collapses algebraic cases to rational ones. Applications include prime--ideal ladders in number fields and exact product laws for dynamical zeta functions, illustrated for subshifts of finite type and circle doubling.</p></details>

Solving a 2001 problem of S\'ark\"ozy on special sequences, Hegyv\'ari proved in 2003 that there exists an infinite sequence $A$ with density $\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{k\alpha}$ such that $$ \big\{f(a_1)+\ldots+f(a_k): a_i\in A, 1\le i\le k\big\}\cap \big\{\lfloor n\alpha\rfloor: n\in \mathbb{N}\big\}=\emptyset. $$ Hegyv\'ari also proved that the density given by him is optimal for $k=2$. In this article, we show that the density $\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{k\alpha}$ given by Hegyv\'ari is actually optimal for all $k\ge 2$. The proof will follow from a modular version of the Brunn-Minkowski inequality established here.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>On one hand, exact structures were introduced by D. Quillen in the '70s. They can be defined as collections of short exact sequences in a fixed abelian category satisfying additional properties. On the other hand, in a recent work, A. Garver, R. Patrias, and H. Thomas introduced Jordan recoverability. Given a bounded quiver $(Q,R)$, a full additive subcategory of $\mathrm{rep}(Q,R)$ is said to be Jordan recoverable if any $X \in \mathscr{C}$ can be recovered, up to isomorphism, from the Jordan form of its generic nilpotent endomorphisms. Such a subcategory $\mathscr{C}$ is said to be canonically Jordan recoverable if, moreover, there exists a precise algebraic procedure that allows one to get back $X \in \mathscr{C}$ from that same Jordan form data. We introduce a new family of operators, called Gen-Sub operators $\mathrm{GS}_\mathcal{E}$, parametrized by the exact structures $\mathcal{E}$ of abelian categories. After showing some properties of those operators in hereditary abelian categories, by focusing on the setting of modules over type $A$ quivers endowed with the diamond exact structure $\mathcal{E}_\diamond$, we establish that the maximal canonically Jordan recoverable subcategories are precisely of the form $\mathrm{GS}_{\mathcal{E}_\diamond}(T)$ for some tilting object $T$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a universal construction of Diophantine equations with bounded complexity in Isabelle/HOL. This is a formalization of our own work in number theory. Hilbert's Tenth Problem was answered negatively by Yuri Matiyasevich, who showed that there is no general algorithm to decide whether an arbitrary Diophantine equation has a solution. However, the problem remains open when generalized to the field of rational numbers, or contrarily, when restricted to Diophantine equations with bounded complexity, characterized by the number of variables $\nu$ and the degree $\delta$. If every Diophantine set can be represented within the bounds $(\nu, \delta)$, we say that this pair is universal, and it follows that the corresponding class of equations is undecidable. In a separate mathematics article, we have determined the first non-trivial universal pair for the case of integer unknowns. In this paper, we contribute a formal verification of the main construction required to establish said universal pair. In doing so, we markedly extend the Isabelle AFP entry on multivariate polynomials, formalize parts of a number theory textbook, and develop classical theory on Diophantine equations in Isabelle. Additionally, our work includes metaprogramming infrastructure designed to efficiently handle complex definitions of multivariate polynomials. Our mathematical draft has been formalized while the mathematical research was ongoing, and benefitted largely from the help of the theorem prover. We reflect how the close collaboration between mathematician and computer is an uncommon but promising modus operandi.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In \cite{Broer1993}, it was shown that certain line bundles on $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}}=T^*G/B$ have vanishing higher cohomology. We prove a generalization of this theorem for real reductive algebraic groups. More specifically, if $\mathcal{N}_\theta$ denotes the cone of nilpotent elements in a Cartan subspace $\mathfrak{p},$ we have a similar construction of a resolution of singularities $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}.$ We prove that for a certain cone of weights $H^i(\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta},\mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}}(\lambda))=0$ for $i> 0.$ This follows by combining a simple calculation of the canonical bundle for $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}$ with Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing. Restricting to the structure sheaf, we get a characterization of the singularities of the normalization of $\mathcal{N}_\theta.$ We use this to show that for groups of QCT (Definition 2), $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{N}_\theta]$ is equivalent as a $K$-representation to a certain cohomologically induced module giving a new proof of a result in \cite{KostantRallis1971}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a Riemannian manifold $M$ and an $L^2$-normalized Laplacian eigenfunction $\psi$ on $M$ with eigenvalue $\lambda^2$, a general problem in analysis is to understand how the mass of $\psi$ distributes around $M$. There are different ways to attack this problem. One of them is to analyze the $L^p$-norm of $\psi$ restricted to a submanifold of $M$. Here, we concentrate on the case $M=S^2$, $p=2$, and we restrict to geodesics of the sphere. Burq, G\'erard, and Tzvetkov showed, for $\gamma$ a geodesic of $S^2$ (and indeed for more general surfaces), that $||\psi|_{\gamma}||_{L^2} \ll \lambda^{1/4}$ and that this bound is optimal in general. In this paper, we specialize to the case in which $\psi$ is an eigenfunction of all the Hecke operators on the sphere and consider the set of geodesics $\mathcal{C}_{D}$ of $S^2$ associated to fundamental discriminants $D<0$. By combining approaches of Ali and Magee, we improve the previous upper bound to $||\psi|_{\mathcal{C}_{D}}||_{L^2} \ll_{D,\varepsilon} \lambda^{\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon>0$, which is essentially sharp.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In order to study cluster-tilted algebras and their intermediate coverings, Zhu introduced the notion of repetitive cluster categories, defined as the orbit categories $\mathcal D^b(\mathcal H)/\langle(\tau^{-1}\Sigma)^p\rangle$ for $1\leq p\in\mathbb{N}$, where $\mathcal H$ is a hereditary abelian category with tilting objects. In this paper, we compute partial but essential results on the Grothendieck groups of the repetitive cluster categories $\mathcal D^b({\rm mod}KA_n)/\langle(\tau^{-1}\Sigma)^p\rangle$ and $\mathcal D^b({\rm mod} KD_n)/\langle(\tau^{-1}\Sigma)^p\rangle$. Our results extend the known computations for classical cluster categories, reveal new structural patterns arising from the repetitive parameter $p$, and provide further evidence of the close interplay between Grothendieck groups, Auslander-Reiten theory, and Coxeter transformations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, motivated by studying special values of zeta functions attached to finite type F_p-schemes, we introduce a category of ``arithmetic C(S^1,R)-modules'' attached to any Dedekind ring R, and compute the 0th K-group of this category. Specializing to the case of R=Z_l for some prime l neq p (resp. R=Z_p), we prove that there is a natural functorial lift of the etale cohomology of perfect etale Z_l sheaves (resp. syntomic cohomology of perfect prismatic F-gauges) on a point to arithmetic C(S^1,Z_l)-modules (resp. arithmetic C(S^1,Z_p)-modules). This allows us to define a notion of the multiplicative Euler characteristic via a map from the K_0-group which makes sense without assuming Tate's semi-simplicity conjecture. In particular, we can remove this hypothesis from a theorem of Milne proving a cohomological formula for zeta values attached to smooth proper F_p-schemes. We also discuss extensions of these zeta value formulae to finite type F_p-schemes, and how recent progress in motivic homotopy theory allows us to prove some results without any assumptions on resolution of singularities or Tate's semi-simplicity conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a simple Lie group. Consider a nilpotent element $e\in \mathfrak{g}$. Let $Z_G(e)$ be the centralizer of $e$ in $G$, and let $A_e:= Z_G(e)/Z_G(e)^{o}$ be its component group. Write $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$ for the set of irreducible components of the Springer fiber $\mathcal{B}_e$. We have an action of $A_e$ on $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$. When $\mathfrak{g}$ is exceptional, we give an explicit description of $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$ as an $A_e$-set. For $\mathfrak{g}$ of classical type, we describe the stabilizers for the $A_e$-action. With this description, we prove a conjecture of Lusztig and Sommers. These results suggest relations (first proposed by Lusztig) between Springer fibers and cells in Weyl groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use functorial methods to define and study $0$-abelian categories, which we propose to be the case $n = 0$ of Jasso's $n$-abelian categories. In particular, we define a bifunctor for $0$-abelian categories with enough injectives or projectives, which is analogous to the extension bifunctor for an abelian category. We prove a few results concerning this bifunctor, including $0$-abelian versions of the long exact sequence involving the extension bifunctors, of a conjecture due to Auslander on the direct summands of the extension functors, and of the Hilton-Rees theorem. These results are then applied to the study of the stable categories of a $0$-abelian category, and a similar discussion is carried out for the stable categories of an abelian category. Moreover, by specializing our results to modules over rings, we show that $0$-abelian categories with additive generators are in correspondence with semi-hereditary rings. We present applications to these rings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Buan, Iyama, Reiten and Smith proved that cluster-tilting objects in triangulated 2-Calabi--Yau categories are closely connected with mutation of quivers with potentials over an algebraically closed field. We prove a more general statement where instead of working with quivers with potentials we consider species with potential over a perfect field. We describe the $3$-preprojective algebra of the tensor product of two tensor algebras of acyclic species using a species with potential. In the case when the Jacobian algebra of a species with potential is self-injective, we provide a description of the Nakayama automorphism of a particular case of mutation of the species with potential where you mutate along orbits of the Nakayama permutation, which preserves self-injectivity. For certain types of Jacobian algebras of species with potentials, we prove that they lie in the scope of the derived Auslander-Iyama correspondence due to Jasso-Muro. Mutating along orbits of the Nakayama permutation stays within this setting, yielding a rich source of examples. All $2$-representation finite $l$-homogeneous algebras that are constructed using certain species with potential and mutations of such species with potentials are considered.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The canonical dimension is an invariant attached to admissible representations of p-adic reductive groups, which has only received significant attention in the case of mod-p representations. In the case of complex representations, the canonical dimension is closely related to the wavefront set. We find a new lower bound for the canonical dimension of a general compactly induced representation over an arbitrary coefficient field. This lower bound is uniform in the sense that it only depends on the group and not on the representation itself. In many cases, this provides a lower bound for the canonical dimension of supercuspidal representations and in the complex case we get a lower bound for the corresponding wavefront set. In order to obtain this result, we first generalize a result on the asymptotic growth of the cardinality of balls in the Bruhat-Tits building to the case of exceptional types.</p></details>

> **Comment:** We introduce the Good Ramanujan Expansions: with good decay for coefficients, studying the consequences

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this self-contained short note, we introduce the new definition of Good Ramanujan Expansion, say G.R.E., for a fixed arithmetic function $F$, building upon a good decay of its coefficients $G$; this, gains $\log-$powers w.r.t. the trivial bound for $G$ and precisely $\log^{1+\eta}$, where the present parameter $\eta>0$ is real. This property alone has important consequences for all the $F$ having a G.R.E. : mainly, 1) the Eratosthenes Transform $F'$ of our $F$ is infinitesimal (see in Theorem 1); 2) when $\eta>1$ (an enhanced decay) we have uniqueness of $G$ (actually, these are the classic Wintner-Carmichael coefficients, see Th.2); 3) we get a bound for $F$ (in Th.3); 4) an important new class of arithmetic functions $F$ can't have a G.R.E. (see Th.4). These are a generalization of Correlations; which in this way, if are, say, a kind of "far from constants", may not have a G.R.E., whence, a fortiori, can't have the R.E.E.F. This is the Ramanujan Exact Explicit Formula, that we introduced with Prof. Ram Murty.</p></details>

If $f$ is surjective and the induced map is an isomorphism, then the functor is an equivalence. These results extend the theorem of Esnault-Mehta on the triviality of $F$-divided sheaves over simply connected varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a descent monomial basis of $\Delta$-Springer modules $R_{n,\lambda,s}$, first defined by Griffin. Our construction simultaneously generalizes the descent basis for the Garsia-Procesi module $R_\lambda$ studied by Carlsson-Chou and Hanada, as well as the descent basis for the generalized coinvariant algebras $R_{n,k}$ studied by Haglund-Rhoades-Shimozono. This basis is deeply connected with a combinatorial object called battery-powered tableaux, introduced by Gillespie-Griffin. We highlight the representation theoretic properties of this monomial basis by using it to give a direct combinatorial proof of the graded Frobenius character of $R_{n,\lambda,s}$ in terms of battery-powered tableaux, a fact which has only the geometric proof of Gillespie-Griffin. We also conjecture a higher Specht basis of $R_{n,\lambda,s}$, generalizing the higher Specht basis of the coinvariant ring defined in Ariki-Terasoma-Yamada. This construction coincides with the Gillespie-Rhoades higher Specht basis for $R_{n,k}$. We give a proof for when $\lambda = (\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ is a partition of two rows.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A Bass order is an order of a number field whose fractional ideals are generated by two elements. The majority of number fields contain infinitely many Bass orders. For example, any order of a number field which contains the maximal order of a subfield with degree 2 or whose discriminant is fourth-power-free in $\mathbb{Z}$, is a Bass order. In this paper, we will propose a closed formula for the number of fractional ideals of a Bass order $R$, up to its invertible ideals, using the conductor of $R$. Since $R$ is a Bass order, this is the same as the number of overorders of $R$. We will also explain the explicit enumeration of all orders containing $R$. Our method is based on the local-global argument and the exhaustion argument, using orbital integrals for $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ as a mass formula.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an integer \( k \geq 2 \), the sequence of \( k \)-generalized Lucas numbers is defined by the recurrence relation \( L_n^{(k)} = L_{n-1}^{(k)} + \cdots + L_{n-k}^{(k)} \) for all \( n \geq 2 \), with initial conditions \( L_0^{(k)} = 2 \), \( L_1^{(k)} = 1 \) for all \( k \geq 2 \), and \( L_{2-k}^{(k)} = \cdots = L_{-1}^{(k)} = 0 \) for \( k \geq 3 \). In this paper, we determine all \( k \)-generalized Lucas numbers that are concatenations of two terms of the same sequence and completely solve this problem for \( k \geq 3 \). Our approach combines nonzero lower bounds for linear forms in logarithms, reduction techniques based on the Baker--Davenport method and the LLL-algorithm, together with continued fraction analysis and computational verification using SageMath.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite group $G$ and positive integer $g$, a $g$-additive basis is a subset of $G$ whose pairwise sums cover each element of $G$ at least $g$ times, with $g$-difference bases defined similarly using pairwise differences. While prior work focused on $1$-additive and $1$-difference bases, recent works of Kravitz and Schmutz--Tait explored $g$-additive and $g$-difference bases in finite abelian groups. This paper investigates such bases in $G^n$, the Cartesian product of a finite abelian group $G$. We construct $g$-additive and $g$-difference bases in $G^n$, which lead to asymptotically sharp upper bounds on the minimal sizes of such bases. Our proofs draw on ideas from additive combinatorics and combinatorial design theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a globally generic cuspidal automorphic representation $\mathit{\Pi}$ of a quasi-split reductive group $G$ over $\mathbb Q$, E. Lapid and Z. Mao proposed a conjecture on the decomposition of the global Whittaker functionals on $\mathit{\Pi}$ into products of an adjoint $L$-value of $\mathit{\Pi}$ and the local Whittaker functionals. In this paper, we consider the algebraic aspect of the Lapid-Mao conjecture. More precisely, when $\mathit{\Pi}$ is $C$-algebraic, we show that the algebraicity of the adjoint $L$-value can be expressed in terms of the Petersson norm of Whittaker-rational cusp forms in $\mathit{\Pi}$, subject to the validity of the Lapid-Mao conjecture. For unitary similitude groups, we also establish an unconditional and more refined algebraicity result. Additionally, we give an explicit formula for the case $G={\rm U}(2,1)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1975, G. E. Andrews challenged the mathematics community to address L. Ehrenpreis' problem, which was to directly prove the modularity of the Rogers-Ramanujan $q$-series' summatory forms. This question is important because many different $q$-series appearing in combinatorics, representation theory, and physics often seem to be "mysteriously" modular, yet there is no general test to confirm this directly from the exotic $q$-series expressions. In this note, we solve this general problem using $q$-series algebra and $q$-series systems of differential equations. Specifically, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which a vector of holomorphic $q$-series on $|q|<1$ forms a vector-valued modular function. This result offers a clear and conceptual path to modularity for "strange" $q$-series.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The (right) $q$-deformed rational numbers was introduced by Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko, and its left variant, whose numerators and denominators are essentially the normalized Jones polynomials of rational links, by Bapat, Becker and Licata. These notions are based on continued fractions and the $q$-deformed modular group $\mathrm{PSL}_q(2,\mathbb{Z})$-actions. In this paper, we introduce the \textit{$q$-transpose} for matrices in $\mathrm{PSL}_q(2,\mathbb{Z})$ to refine the basic perspective of the theory. For example, we present a new proof and a refinement of a theorem of Leclere and Morier-Genoud stating that the trace of $A \in \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ is always palindromic and sign coherent. We also show arithmetic/combinatorial results on left $q$-deformed rationals (e.g., the criterion for their palindromicity). Finally, we discuss the connection to the conjecture of Kantarc{\i} O\u{g}uz on circular fence posets.</p></details>

If $n\ge 6$, $p\ge 5$ and the coefficients are fixed and satisfy $\lambda_1,...,\lambda_n>0$ and $(\lambda_{n+1},p)=1$ (inhomogeneous case), we obtain an asymptotic formula which is valid for integral solutions $(x_1,...,x_n)$ in cubes of side length at least $p^{(1/2+\varepsilon)m}$, centered at the origin. If $n\ge 4$ and $\lambda_{n+1}=0$ (homogeneous case), we prove a result of the same strength for coefficients $\lambda_i$ which are allowed to vary with $m$.

> **Comment:** 12 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the envelopes of holomorphy of Matsuki orbits $M_{\ell,m,r}$ arising as intersections of $G_0$- and $K$-orbits in complex Grassmannians. These orbits, equipped with natural CR-structures, form a class of compact homogeneous CR-submanifolds whose analytic continuation properties are of fundamental interest. Building on Rossi's theory of holomorphic extension, we establish that the envelope of holomorphy of each Matsuki orbit coincides biholomorphically with the containing $K$-orbit $O_{\ell,m}$. Our approach provides a geometric proof based on the holomorphic fiber bundle structure $\pi : M_{\ell,m,r} \to \mathrm{Gr}_{\ell}(E_+) \times \mathrm{Gr}_{m}(E_-)$, clarifying the role of compact isotropic fibers in constraining holomorphic extension. Explicit examples, including the orbit $M_{1,1,1} \subset \mathrm{Gr}_3(\mathbb{C}^8)$, illustrate the method and highlight connections with classical constructions in complex geometry and representation theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras are studied from the perspective of representation types. We establish that (like other representation types) the notions of $E$-finiteness and $E$-tameness are invariant under mutations of quivers with potentials. Consequently, by applying our results on laminations on marked surfaces, and the results of Plamondon and the second author, we classify $E$-finite and $E$-tame finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras. More precisely, we demonstrate that (resp., except for a few cases,) a finite-dimensional Jacobian algebra $\mathcal{J}(Q,W)$ is $E$-finite (resp., $E$-tame) if and only if it is $\mathrm{g}$-finite (resp., $\mathrm{g}$-tame), if and only if it is representation-finite (resp., representation-tame), and this holds exactly when $Q$ is of Dynkin type (resp., finite mutation type), as shown by Geiss, Labardini and Schr\"{o}er. This also proves Demonet's conjecture for finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras. Furthermore, we provide an application of our results in the theory of cluster algebras. More precisely, we establish the converse of Reading's theorem: if the $\mathrm{g}$-fan of the cluster algebra associated with a connected quiver $Q$ is complete, then $Q$ must be of Dynkin type.</p></details>

Additionally, an incorrect citation was fixed, definitions were supplemented, and the structure was streamlined by merging the final section into the preceding one

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper constructs weight-shifting integral operators for Maass forms on the full modular group SL(2,Z). Under the weight parity condition t = k (mod 2), the operator utilizes an automorphic kernel constructed via Poincare series from a seed kernel. The seed kernel is defined as the product of a covariant factor and an invariant factor with respect to the diagonal action of SL(2,R). A spectral condition is imposed that the kernel must be an eigenfunction of the weight-t hyperbolic Laplacian. This problem reduces to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the invariant factor, which is identified as a Papperitz-Riemann equation. By transforming this equation into the Gauss Hypergeometric Differential Equation (HDE), the hypergeometric type of the operator is established. Analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the hypergeometric solutions yields the convergence conditions for the automorphic kernel and the integral operator, requiring the selection of the subdominant solution. The operator is defined via regularization based on the Hyperbolic Cauchy Principal Value to handle the diagonal singularities of the kernel. The automorphy of the transformed function is verified under the assumption of absolute convergence. A necessary condition for the intertwining property, namely the coincidence of the kernel's spectral parameter and the input Maass form's Laplacian eigenvalue, is conditionally derived. Analysis of the smoothness and the behavior at the cusp of the transformed function is deferred to subsequent research. Finally, the relevance of the hypergeometric structure to Hecke algebra compatibility and motivic interpretation is discussed.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study a new class of topological $G$-spaces generalizing the classical flag manifolds $G/T$ of compact connected Lie groups. These spaces, which we call the $m$-quasi-flag manifolds $ F_m = F_m(G,T) $, are topological realizations of the algebras $ Q_k(W) $ of $k$-quasi-invariant polynomials of the Weyl group $ W $ in the sense that their (even-dimensional) $G$-equivariant cohomology $ H_G(F_m, {\mathbb C}) $ is naturally isomorphic to $ Q_k(W) $, where $ m $ is a $W$-invariant integer-valued function on the system of roots of $W$ and $ k = \frac{m}{2}$ or $ \frac{m+1}{2}$ depending on whether $m$ is even or odd. Many topological properties and algebraic structures related to the flag manifolds can be extended to quasi-flag manifolds. We obtain our cohomological results by constructing rational algebraic models of quasi-flag manifolds in terms of coaffine stacks -- a certain kind of derived stacks introduced by B.To\"en and J. Lurie to provide an algebro-geometric framework for rational homotopy theory. Besides cohomology, we also compute the equivariant K-theory of quasi-flag manifolds and extend some of our cohomological results to the multiplicative setting. On the topological side, our approach is strongly influenced by the classical work on homotopy decompositions of classifying spaces of compact Lie groups; however, the diagrams that we use in our decompositions do not arise from collections of subgroups of $G$ but rather from moment graphs -- combinatorial objects introduced in a different area of topology called the GKM theory.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-27 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** John Abbott, Nico Mexis &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AC &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present three new, practical algorithms for polynomials in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$: one to test if a polynomial is cyclotomic, one to determine which cyclotomic polynomials are factors, and one to determine whether the given polynomial is LRS-degenerate. A polynomial is "LRS-degenerate" iff it has two distinct roots $\alpha, \beta$ such that $\beta = \zeta \alpha$ for some root of unity $\zeta$. All three algorithms are based on "intelligent brute force". The first two produce the indexes of the cyclotomic polynomials; the third produces a list of degeneracy orders. The algorithms are implemented in CoCoALib.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by applications to matrix multiplication algorithms, Pratt asked (ITCS'24) how large a subset of $[n] \times [n]$ could be without containing a skew-corner: three points $(x,y), (x,y+h),(x+h,y')$ with $h \ne 0$. We prove any skew corner-free set has size at most $\exp(-\Omega(\log^{1/12} n))\cdot n^2$, nearly matching the best known lower bound of $\exp(-O(\sqrt{\log n}))\cdot n^2$ by Beker (arXiv'24). Our techniques generalize those of Kelley and Meka's recent breakthrough on three-term arithmetic progression (FOCS'23), answering a question of Beker (arXiv'24). We note that a similar bound was obtained concurrently and independently by Mili\'cevi\'c (arXiv'24).</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-27 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ram Karan Choudhary, Sunil Kumar Prajapati &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we present a combinatorial formula for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of nested GVZ $p$-groups, where $p$ is an odd prime. Using this formula, we derive an explicit combinatorial expression for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of all two-generator $p$-groups of class $2$. Additionally, we provide explicit combinatorial formulas for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of certain families of nested GVZ $p$-groups with arbitrarily large nilpotency class. We also classify all nested GVZ $p$-groups of order at most $p^5$ and compute the Wedderburn decomposition of their rational group algebras. Finally, we determine a complete set of primitive central idempotents for the rational group algebras of nested GVZ $p$-groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a number field. Let $q(x_1,\cdots,x_n)$ be a non-degenerate integral quadratic form in $n\geq 3$ variables with coefficients in $k$ and $m\in k^\times$. Let $X$ be the affine quadric defined by $q=m$ in $\mathbb{A}^n_k$. Based on results on effective equidistribution of $S$-integral points in symmetric spaces, we establish the following: (i) The arithmetic purity of strong approximation off any single place of $k$ for $X$; (ii) The geometric sieve for $p_0$-integral points on $X$ when $k=\mathbb{Q}$ and $p_0$ is a prime number.</p></details>
