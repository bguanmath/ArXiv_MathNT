### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05560v1'>2508.05560</a>\]&nbsp; **Xeric varieties**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Natalia Garcia-Fritz, Hector Pasten &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over a number field $k$. The Green--Griffiths--Lang conjecture relates the question of finiteness of rational points in $X$ to the triviality of rational maps from abelian varieties to $X$ and to complex hyperbolicity. Here we investigate the phenomenon of sparsity of rational points in $X$ -- roughly speaking, when there are very few rational points if counted ordered by height. We are interested in the case when sparsity holds over every finite extension of $k$, in which case we say that the variety is \emph{xeric}. We initiate a systematic study of the relation of this property with the non-existence of rational curves in $X$ as well as with certain notion of $p$-adic hyperbolicity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We revisit an identification of the quantum Toda lattice for $\mathrm{GL}_N$ and the truncated shifted Yangian of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, as well as related constructions, from a purely algebraic point of view, bypassing the topological medium of the homology of the affine Grassmannian. For instance, we interpret the Gerasimov-Kharchev-Lebedev-Oblezin homomorphism into the algebra of difference operators via a finite analog of the Miura transform. This algebraic identification is deduced by relating degenerate affine Hecke algebras to the simplest example of a rational Feigin-Odesskii shuffle product. As a bonus, we obtain a presentation of the latter via a mirabolic version of the Kostant-Whittaker reduction.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give an affirmative answer to a question asked by N. Moshchevitin \cite{m1} in his lecture at International Congress of Basic Science, Beijing, 2024 (see also \cite{m}, Section 6.3). The question is that whether the remainder $$ R_n=\sum_{j=1}^{2^n}\left(\xi_{j,n}-\frac{j}{2^n}\right)^2-2^n\int_0^1( ?(x)-x))^2\text{d}x $$ tends to $0$ when $n$ tends to infinity, where $\xi_{j,n}$ are elements of the Stern-Brocot sequence and $?(x)$ denotes Minkowski Question-Mark Function. We present some extended results and give a correct proof of a theorem on the Fourier-Stieltjes coefficient of the inverse function of $?(x)$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Malcolm Hoong Wai Chen &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 11 pages. Title, abstract, and content have been revised to focus only on the contribution towards Galois groups of $x^{12}+ax^6+b$

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f(x)=x^{12}+ax^6+b \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial, $g_4(x)=x^4+ax^2+b$, $g_6(x)=x^6+ax^3+b$, and let $G_4$ and $G_6$ be the Galois group of $g_4(x)$ and $g_6(x)$, respectively. Building upon known characterizations of $G_4$ and $G_6$ in the literature, this paper provides an elementary characterization of all sixteen possible Galois groups of $f(x)$. In particular, we show that the Galois group of $f(x)$ can be uniquely determined by the pair $(G_4,G_6)$ along with testing whether at most two expressions involving $a$ and $b$ are rational squares.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jonathan Ditlevsen, Jan Frahm &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We obtain the explicit direct integral decomposition of Stein's complementary series representations and Speh representations of $\mathrm{GL}(2n,\mathbb{R})$ when restricted to the subgroup $\mathrm{GL}(2n-1, \mathbb{R})$. The decomposition is a direct integral of unitarily induced representations from a maximal parabolic subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}(2n-1, \mathbb{R})$ with Levi factor $\mathrm{GL}(2n-2, \mathbb{R})\times\mathrm{GL}(1, \mathbb{R})$, where the induction data consists of a complementary series or Speh representation of the factor $\mathrm{GL}(2n-2, \mathbb{R})$ with the same parameter as the one of $\mathrm{GL}(2n, \mathbb{R})$ and a character of $\mathrm{GL}(1, \mathbb{R})$. These results are in line with the theory of adduced representations. The main tools in the proof are two families of symmetry breaking operators between degenerate series representations of $\mathrm{GL}(2n, \mathbb{R})$ and $\mathrm{GL}(2n-1, \mathbb{R})$ whose meromorphic properties are studied in great detail.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05361v1'>2508.05361</a>\]&nbsp; **On certain root number $1$ cases of the cube sum problem**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Shamik Das, Somnath Jha &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 14 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider certain families of integers $n$ determined by some congruence condition, such that the global root number of the elliptic curve $E_{-432n^2}: Y^2=X^3-432n^2$ is $1$ for every $n$, however a given $n$ may or may not be a sum of two rational cubes. We give explicit criteria in terms of the $2$-parts and $3$-parts of the ideal class groups of certain cubic number fields to determine whether such an $n$ is a cube sum. In particular, we study integers $n$ divisible by $3$ such that the global root number of $E_{-432n^2}$ is $1$. For example, for a prime $\ell \equiv 7 \pmod{9}$, we show that for $3\ell$ to be a sum of two rational cubes, it is necessary that the ideal class group of $\Q(\sqrt[3]{12\ell})$ contains $\frac{\Z}{6\Z}\oplus \frac{\Z}{3\Z}$ as a subgroup. Moreover, for a positive proportion of primes $\ell \equiv 7 \pmod{9}$, $3\ell$ can not be a sum of two rational cubes. A key ingredient in the proof is to explore the relation between the $2$-Selmer group and the $3$-isogeny Selmer group of $E_{-432n^2}$ with the ideal class groups of appropriate cubic number fields.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 9 pages, 4 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the plane, three integer points ("fleas") are given. At every tick of time, two of them (say, P,Q) instantly jump to two vacant points R,S, so that PQRS is a square with that order of vertices. Description of all integers and half-integers which occur as areas of spanned triangles turns out to be unexpectedly intricate problem. For example, if one starts from a triple (0,0), (2,0), (4,1), these positive integers are missed: 2*{0, 1, 4, 15, 16, 20, 79, 84, 95, 119, 156}, with no other up to 3*10^6 (and seemingly, none at all); half-integers which are missed seem to form a 39-element set (the largest of them being 11365/2). However, there exist certain starting setups which have an "integrable" component as part of the answer. We demonstrate that for the initial triple (0,0), (2,1), (3,2), the integers missed as areas are perfect squares, and the the sporadic set {5, 29, 80, 99, 179} with no other elements up to 3*10^6 (most likely, no other at all; all half-integers serve as areas).</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08502v2'>2504.08502</a>\]&nbsp; **Powerfree integers and Fourier bounds**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sebastián Carrillo Santana &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 21 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a general approach for showing when a set of integers $\mathscr{A}$ has infinitely many $k^{th}$ powerfree numbers without relying on equidistribution estimates for $\mathscr{A}$. In particular, we show that if the Fourier transform of $\mathscr{A}$ satisfies certain $L^{\infty}$ and $L^{1}$ bounds, and is also "decreasing" in some sense, then $\mathscr{A}$ contains infinitely many $k^{th}$ powerfree numbers. We then use this method to show that there are infinitely many cubefree palindromes in base $b\ge 1100$, and in the process we obtain new $L^{1}$ bounds for the Fourier transform of the set of palindromes. We also show that there are infinitely many squarefree integers such that its reverse is also squarefree in any base $b\ge 2$. Moreover, we show that there are infinitely many squarefree integers with a missing digit in base $b\ge 5$, and infinitely many such cubefree integers in base $b\ge 3$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 37 pages, small changes made, to appear in the Proceedings of the 9th European Congress of Mathematics

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Suppose we partition the integers into finitely many cells. Can we always find a solution of the equation $x^2+y^2=z^2$ with $x,y,z$ on the same cell? What about more general homogeneous quadratic equations in three variables? These are basic questions in arithmetic Ramsey theory, which have recently been partially answered using ideas inspired by ergodic theory and tools such as Gowers-uniformity properties and concentration estimates of bounded multiplicative functions. The aim of this article is to provide an introduction to this exciting research area, explaining the main ideas behind the recent progress and some of the important challenges that lie ahead.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20691v2'>2503.20691</a>\]&nbsp; **Quantum group origins of edge states in double-scaled SYK**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Andreas Belaey, Thomas G. Mertens, Thomas Tappeiner &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** hep-th &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** v2: 47 pages + appendices, corrected typos

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) is known to have an underlying quantum group theoretical description. We precisely pinpoint the quantum group structure, improving upon earlier work in the literature. This allows us to utilize this framework for bulk gravitational applications. We explain bulk discretization in DSSYK from the underlying irreducibility of the representations. We derive trumpet and brane amplitudes using character insertions of the quantum group, simplifying earlier calculations. Most importantly, we factorize the bulk Hilbert space dual to DSSYK in the quantum group description using a complete set of edge degrees of freedom living at a bulk entangling surface. An analogous treatment for $\mathcal{N}=1$ DSSYK is provided in the same quantum group theoretical framework.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jonathan Chappelon &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A Steinhaus triangle modulo $m$ is a finite down-pointing triangle of elements in the finite cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ satisfying the same local rule as the standard Pascal triangle modulo $m$. A Steinhaus triangle modulo $m$ is said to be balanced if it contains all the elements of $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ with the same multiplicity. In this paper, the existence of infinitely many balanced Steinhaus triangles modulo $m$, for any positive integer $m$, is shown. This is achieved by considering periodic triangles generated from interlaced arithmetic progressions. This positively answers a weak version of a problem, due to John C. Molluzzo in 1978, that has remained unsolved to date for the even values of $m\geqslant 12$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 22 pages, 13 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>When $\pi:\widetilde{\Sigma}\rightarrow D^2$ is a cover of the disc branched over $n$ marked points, the braid group $B_n$ acts on the disc by homeomorphisms fixing the marked points setwise. A braid $\beta$ \textit{lifts} if there is a homeomorphism $\widetilde{\beta}\in \textit{Mod}(\widetilde{\Sigma})$ such that $\beta\circ \pi=\pi\circ \widetilde{\beta}$. For arbitrary covers, the \textit{lifting homomorphism} taking $\beta$ to $\widetilde{\beta}$ is only defined on a proper subgroup of the braid group. This paper extends the lifting homomorphism to a map from a coloured braid groupoid to a mapping class groupoid for all simple covers of the disc. We characterise the lift of every coloured braid, recovering the classical lifting homomorphism on the liftable braid group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The linearized double shuffle Lie algebra $\mathfrak{ls}$ is a well-studied Lie algebra, which reflects the depth-graded structure of multiple zeta values. We introduce a generalization $\mathfrak{lq}$, which is motivated from the $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic structure of multiple q-zeta values and multiple Eisenstein series. Precisely, we show that $\mathfrak{lq}$ is a Lie algebra, where the Lie bracket is related to Ecalle's ari bracket on bimoulds, and give an embedding of $\mathfrak{ls}$ into $\mathfrak{lq}$.</p></details>

The centers, the semisimplicity, the Jacobson radicals and their nilpotent indices, the Wedderburn-Artin decompositions of the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of direct products of group divisible association schemes are obtained.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Singer algebraic transfer is a fundamental homomorphism in algebraic topology, providing a bridge between the homology of classifying spaces and the cohomology of the Steenrod algebra $\mathcal{A}$, which forms the $E_2$-term of the Adams spectral sequence. The domain of its dual is isomorphic to the space of $GL_k(\mathbb{F}_2)$-invariants in the quotient of the polynomial algebra, $(\mathcal{QP_k})^{GL_k(\mathbb{F}_2)}$, where $\mathcal{P}_k$ is regarded as a module over $\mathcal{A}$. A direct computation of this invariant space and its dual (i.e., the domain of the Singer transfer) remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we construct a new algorithm to compute $(\mathcal{QP_k})^{GL_k(\mathbb{F}_2)}$, which differs from the method presented in our recent work [15]. We refer to this new approach as the Global Cluster Analysis algorithm. It builds a \emph{weight interaction graph} to identify clusters of interacting weight spaces that form closed $\Sigma_k$-submodules (where $\Sigma_k \subset GL_k(\mathbb{F}_2)$). By performing invariance analysis on these larger clusters, our algorithm enables a complete and accurate computation of the global $\Sigma_k$-invariants, which are then used to determine the final $GL_k(\mathbb F_2)$-invariants. We also introduce an algorithm to directly compute the domain of the Singer transfer for ranks $k \leq 3$ in certain generic degrees, based entirely on Boardman's modular representation theory framework [2].</p></details>

> **Comment:** 39 pages, revised based on referee comments

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Mossinghoff, Trudgian, and the first author~\cite{MMT23} recently introduced a family of arithmetic functions called ``fake $\mu$'s'', which are multiplicative functions for which there is a $\{-1,0,1\}$-valued sequence $(\varepsilon_j)_{j=1}^{\infty}$ such that $f(p^j) = \varepsilon_j$ for all primes $p$. They investigated comparative number-theoretic results for fake $\mu$'s and in particular proved oscillation results at scale $\sqrt{x}$ for the summatory functions of fake $\mu$'s with $\varepsilon_1=-1$ and $\varepsilon_2=1$. In this paper, we establish new oscillation results for the summatory functions of all nontrivial fake $\mu$'s at scales $x^{1/2\ell}$ where $\ell$ is a positive integer (the ``critical index'') depending on $f$; for $\ell=1$ this recovers the oscillation results in~\cite{MMT23}. Our work also recovers results on the indicator functions of powerfree and powerfull numbers; we generalize techniques applied to each of these examples to extend to all fake $\mu$'s.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Polylogarithms on arbitrary higher-genus Riemann surfaces can be constructed from meromorphic integration kernels with at most simple poles, whose definition was given by Enriquez via functional properties. In this work, homotopy-invariant convolution integrals over homology cycles are shown to provide a direct construction of Enriquez kernels solely from holomorphic Abelian differentials and the prime form. Our new representation is used to demonstrate the closure of the space of Enriquez kernels under convolution over homology cycles and under variations of the moduli. The results of this work further strengthen the remarkable parallels of Enriquez kernels with the non-holomorphic modular tensors recently developed in an alternative construction of higher-genus polylogarithms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a finite dimensional, bigraded module over the polynomial ring in two variables, we define its two-parameter count, a natural number, and its end-curves, a set of plane curves. These are two-dimensional analogues of the notions of bar-count and endpoints of singly-graded modules over the polynomial ring in one variable, from persistence theory. We show that our count is the unique one satisfying certain natural conditions; as a consequence, several inclusion-exclusion formulas in two-parameter persistence yield the same positive number, which equals our count, and which in turn equals the number of end-curves, giving geometric meaning to this count. We show that the end-curves determine the classical Betti tables by showing that they interpolate between generators, relations, and syzygies. Using the band representations of a certain string algebra, we show that the set of end-curves admits a canonical partition, where each part forms a closed curve on the plane; we call this the boundary of the module. As an invariant, the boundary is neither weaker nor stronger than the rank invariant, but, in contrast to the rank invariant, it is a complete invariant on the set of spread-decomposable representations. Our results connect several lines of work in multiparameter persistence, and their extension to modules over the real-exponent polynomial ring in two variables relates to two-dimensional Morse theory.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Francis Brown, Tiago J. Fonseca &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A well-known conjecture of Gross and Zagier states that the values of the higher automorphic Green's function at pairs of points with complex multiplication in the upper half-plane are proportional to the logarithm of an algebraic number. It was recently settled in the case of congruence subgroups of the form $\Gamma_0(N)$ by analytic methods. In this paper we provide a geometric and motivic interpretation of the general conjecture, and show that it is a consequence of a standard conjecture in the theory of motives. In addition, we define a new class of matrix-valued higher Green's functions for both odd and even weight modular forms, and show that they are single-valued periods of a motive constructed from a suitable moduli stack of elliptic curves with marked points. The motive has the structure of a biextension involving symmetric powers of the motives of elliptic curves. This suggests a very general extension of the Gross-Zagier conjecture relating values of matrix-valued higher Green's functions at points which do not necessarily have complex multiplication to special values of $L$-functions. In particular, our motivic interpretation of the Gross-Zagier log-algebraicity conjecture enables us to give a completely geometric proof in level 1 and weight 4 by showing that the motive of the moduli stack $\mathcal{M}_{1,3}$ of elliptic curves with 3 marked points is mixed Tate. In the course of this paper we develop many new foundational results on: the theory of weak harmonic lifts, meromorphic modular forms, biextensions of modular motives, and their corresponding algebraic de Rham cohomology and single-valued periods, which may all be of independent interest.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Building on our previous work in rank two, we use quiver varieties to give a combinatorial upper bound on dimensions of certain imaginary root spaces for rank 3 symmetric Kac-Moody algebras. We describe an explicit method for extracting combinatorics when the Dynkin diagram is bipartite (i.e. two of the nodes are not connected). As in rank two we believe these bounds are quite tight and we give computational evidence to this effect, although there is more error in rank 3 than in rank 2.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cohen proved that the infinite variable polynomial ring $R=k[x_1,x_2,\ldots]$ is noetherian with respect to the action of the infinite symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}$. The first two authors began a program to understand the $\mathfrak{S}$-equivariant algebra of $R$ in detail. In previous work, they classified the $\mathfrak{S}$-prime ideals of $R$. An important example of an $\mathfrak{S}$-prime is the ideal $\mathfrak{h}_s$ generated by $(s+1)$st powers of the variables. In this paper, we study the category of $R/\mathfrak{h}_s$-modules. We obtain a number of results, and mention just three here: (a) we determine the Grothendieck group of the category; (b) we show that the Krull--Gabriel dimension is $s$; and (c) we obtain generators for the derived category. This paper will play a key role in subsequent work where we study general modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The aim of this article is to discuss the derived equivalence problem for a local model of the simple flop of type $D_4$, which was found by Kanemitsu. First, tilting bundles on both sides of the flop are constructed, and then those tilting bundles are applied to prove the derived equivalence. This derived equivalence for the flop deduces derived equivalences between general K3 surfaces of degree $12$. The study of this example of a flop is very similar to the author's previous work for the simple of flop of type $G_2^{\dagger}$, but the construction and the analysis of tilting bundles become harder.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb V$ be an $\mathbb N$-graded $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra (VOA), not necessarily rational or self-dual. Using a special case of the sewing-factorization theorem from [GZ25a], we show that the end $\mathbb E=\int_{\mathbb M\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)}\mathbb M\otimes_{\mathbb C}\mathbb M'$ in $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes2})$ (where $\mathbb{M}'$ is the contragredient module of $\mathbb{M}$) admits a natural structure of associative $\mathbb C$-algebra compatible with its $\mathbb{V}^{\otimes2}$-module structure. Moreover, we show that a suitable category $\mathrm{Coh}_{\mathrm{L}}(\mathbb E)$ of left $\mathbb E$-modules is isomorphic, as a linear category, to $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)$, and that the space of vacuum torus conformal blocks is isomorphic to the space $\mathrm{SLF}(\mathbb E)$ of symmetric linear functionals on $\mathbb E$. Combining these results with the main theorem of [GZ25b], we prove a conjecture of Gainutdinov-Runkel: For any projective generator $\mathbb G$ in $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)$, the pseudo-$q$-trace construction yields a linear isomorphism from $\mathrm{SLF}(\mathrm{End}_{\mathbb V}(\mathbb{G})^{\mathrm{opp}})$ to the space of vacuum torus conformal blocks of $\mathbb V$. In particular, if $A$ is a unital finite-dimensional $\mathbb C$-algebra such that the category of finite-dimensional left $A$-modules is equivalent to $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)$, then $\mathrm{SLF}(A)$ is linearly isomorphic to the space of vacuum torus conformal blocks of $\mathbb V$. This confirms a conjecture of Arike-Nagatomo.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Quasi-characters are solutions of simple modular differential equations that form an explicit basis for the space of all admissible characters that can potentially describe rational CFT. They were classified for rank-$2$ in arXiv:1810.09472 [hep-th], where it was conjectured that their $q$-series has coefficients of alternating sign that stabilise to a fixed sign at order $\frac{c}{12}$ and sometimes undergo more exotic behaviour -- where $c$ is the central charge. Here we prove some of these conjectures and estimate the growth of coefficients near the stabilisation point. We also explain what role the signs play in the construction of admissible characters from quasi-characters.</p></details>

Our methods make use of the toric geometry of the ambient surface $S$ to produce curves which interpolate the low degree points on $C$.

This wheel is in fact derived from the Milnor fiber of corresponding simple singularities of two variables, and the bilinear form on the geometric root system is the negative of its symmetrized Seifert form. Furthermore, we give a completely geometric definition of simple Lie algebras using arcs, Seifert form and variation operator of the singularity theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite central extension $\tilde{G}$ of a classical $p$-adic reductive group, we consider the endomorphism algebra of some induced projective generator \`a la Bernstein of the category of smooth representations of $\tilde{G}$. In the case where the Levi subgroups decompose, we can compute this algebra to get a result similar to the one previously obtained by the first author for classical $p$-adic groups, showing that this intertwining algebra is a twisted semi-direct product of an affine Hecke algebra with parameters by a twisted finite group algebra. We discuss also the general case. We give then an application to the category of genuine representations of a $p$-adic metaplectic group. Using results of C. M\oe glin relative to the Howe correspondence, we show that the Bernstein components of these groups are equivalent to tensor products of categories of unipotent representations of classical groups. This generalizes a previous result of the first author. It implies an equivalence of categories between the category of genuine representations of the $p$-adic metaplectic group and the direct sums of those of smooth representations of the corresponding odd special orthogonal group and its pure inner form.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by the construction of Newton--Okounkov bodies and toric degenerations via cluster algebras in [GHKK18, FO25], we consider a family of Newton--Okounkov polytopes of a complex smooth Fano variety $X$ related by a composition of tropicalized cluster mutations. According to the work of [HK15], the toric degeneration associated with each Newton--Okounkov polytope $\Delta$ in the family produces a completely integrable system of $X$ over $\Delta$. We investigate circumstances in which each completely integrable system possesses a monotone Lagrangian torus fiber. We provide a sufficient condition, based on the data of tropical integer points and exchange matrices, for the family of constructed monotone Lagrangian tori to contain infinitely many monotone Lagrangian tori, no two of which are related by any symplectomorphism. By employing this criterion and exploiting the correspondence between the tropical integer points and the dual canonical basis elements, we generate infinitely many distinct monotone Lagrangian tori on flag manifolds of arbitrary type except in a few cases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate races among prime ideals in number fields when there are two or more competing conjugacy classes. In their work [4], Fiorilli and Jouve studied two-way races in number fields and showed that-unlike the classical setting of primes in arithmetic progressions-these biases can approach the extreme values of 0 and 1. They also identified when these biases tend toward one-half (as the degree of the extension grows), which we call ''moderate biases'' because that behavior mirrors the classical case. In this paper, we extend their analysis to races with r competing conjugacy classes (rway races) and precisely study the cases where these biases are moderate (meaning they tend to 1/r! as the discriminant of the extension grows). Our first main result is an explicit formula for the bias in any r-way race (for all r $\ge$ 2), generalizing the two-way formula of Fiorilli and Jouve [4] and Lamzouri's r-way expression in the classical case of residue classes modulo q [12], under the same hypotheses. Using this formula, we give a criterion characterizing completely, in the abelian case, r-moderate races. Surprisingly, once r $\ge$ 3 this criterion is independent of r, making the two-way race exceptional. We also construct families of number fields exhibiting such moderacy, we prove density results for the values of logarithmic densities and exhibit different behaviors of those densities between the cases r = 3 and r $\ge$ 4. and showed that its magnitude governs the bias: 2 ) converges to the extreme values 1 or 0. $\bullet$ Moderate bias.

Applying this criterion to several explicit families such that the degree grows to $\infty$, Fiorilli and Jouve produced examples of both moderate and extreme biases along families of number fields. In the same spirit, Bailleul [1] investigated dihedral and quaternion extensions, uncovering further families in which the densities not only approach the value 1/2 but can again be made to lie arbitrarily near the extremes, while also highlighting the influence of central zeros of Artin L-functions on the behavior of those densities.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A cluster algebra is an algebraic structure generated by operations of a quiver (a directed graph) called the mutations and their associated simple birational mappings. By using a graph-combinatorial approach, we present a systematic way to derive a tropical, i.e. subtraction-free birational, representation of Weyl groups from cluster algebras. Our results provide an extensive class of Weyl group actions, including previously known examples with algebro-geometric background, and hence are relevant to the q-Painleve equations and their higher-order extensions. Key ingredients of the argument are the combinatorial aspects of the reflection associated with a cycle subgraph in the quiver. We also study symplectic structures of the discrete dynamical systems thus obtained. The normal form of a skew-symmetric integer matrix allows us to choose Darboux coordinates while preserving the birationality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider subsets of linearly independent roots in a certain root system $\varPhi$. Let $S'$ be such a subset, and let $S'$ be associated with any Carter diagram $\Gamma'$. The main question of the paper: what root $\gamma \in \varPhi$ can be added to $S'$ so that $S' \cup \gamma$ is also a subset of linearly independent roots? This extra root $\gamma$ is called the linkage root. The vector $\gamma^{\nabla}$ of inner products $\{(\gamma,\tau'_i)\mid \tau'_i \in S'\}$ is called the linkage label vector. Let $B_{\Gamma'}$ be the Cartan matrix associated with $\Gamma'$. It is shown that $\gamma$ is a linkage root if and only if $\mathscr{B}^{\vee}_{\Gamma'}(\gamma^{\nabla}) < 2$, where $\mathscr{B}^{\vee}_{\Gamma'}$ is a quadratic form with the matrix inverse to $B_{\Gamma'}$. The set of all linkage roots for $\Gamma'$ is called a linkage system and is denoted by $\mathscr{L}(\Gamma')$. The Cartan matrix associated with any Carter diagram $\Gamma'$ is conjugate to the Cartan matrix associated with some Dynkin diagram $\Gamma$, [St23]. The sizes of $\mathscr{L}(\Gamma')$ and $\mathscr{L}(\Gamma)$ are the same. Let $W^{\vee}$ be the Weyl group of the quadratic form $\mathscr{B}^{\vee}_{\Gamma'}$. This group acts on the linkage system and forms several orbits. The sizes and structure of orbits for linkage systems $\mathscr{L}(D_l)$ and $\mathscr{L}(D_l(a_k))$ are presented.</p></details>

Inspired by work of Conde, Gorsky, Marks and Zvonareva, for $d$ an odd positive integer, we show there is a bijective correspondence between rank functions on $\mathrm{\mathsf{Proj}}A$ and additive functions on $\mathrm{\mathsf{mod}}(\mathrm{\mathsf{Proj}}A)$, where $\mathrm{\mathsf{Proj}}A$ is endowed with the Amiot-Lin $(d+2)$-angulated category structure.

> **Comment:** 33 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a novel approach to study hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras, and more specifically, the Feingold-Frenkel algebra $\mathfrak{F}$, which is based on considering the tensor algebra of level-one states before descending to the Lie algebra by converting tensor products into multiple commutators. This method enables us to exploit the presence of mutually commuting coset Virasoro algebras, whose number grows without bound with increasing affine level. We present the complete decomposition of the tensor algebra under the affine and coset Virasoro symmetries for all levels $\ell\leq 5$, as well as the maximal tensor ground states from which all elements of $\mathfrak{F}$ up to level five can be (redundantly) generated by the joint action of the affine and coset Virasoro generators, and subsequent conversion to multi-commutators, which are then expressed in terms of transversal and longitudinal DDF states. We outline novel directions for future work.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We explore from several perspectives the following question: given $X\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ and $N\in \mathbb{N}$, what is the maximum size $D(X,N)$ of $A\subseteq \{1,2,\dots,N\}$ before $A$ is forced to contain two distinct elements that differ by an element of $X$? The set of forbidden differences, $X$, is called \textit{intersective} if $D(X,N)=o(N)$, with the most well-studied examples being $X=S=\{n^2: n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ and $X=\mathcal{P}-1=\{p-1: p\text{ prime}\}$. In addition to some new results, including exact formulas and estimates for $D(X,N)$ in some non-intersective cases like $X=\mathcal{P}$ and $X=S+k$, $k\in \mathbb{N}$, we also provide a comprehensive survey of known bounds and extensive computational data. In particular, we utilize an existing algorithm for finding maximum cliques in graphs to determine $D(S,N)$ for $N\leq 300$ and $D(\mathcal{P}-1,N)$ for $N\leq 500$. None of these exact values appear previously in the literature.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Famously, Kohel proved that isogeny graphs of ordinary elliptic curves are beautifully structured objects, now called volcanos. We prove graph structural theorems for abelian varieties of any dimension with commutative endomorphism ring and containing a fixed locally Bass order, leveraging an ideal-theoretic perspective on isogeny graphs. This generalizes previous results, which relied on restrictive additional assumptions, such as maximal real multiplication, ordinary, and absolutely simple (Brooks, Jetchev, Wesolowski 2017). In particular, our work also applies to non-simple and non-ordinary isogeny classes. To obtain our results, we first prove a structure theorem for the lattice of inclusion of the overorders of a locally Bass order in an \'etale algebra which is of independent interest. This analysis builds on a careful study of local singularities of the orders. We include several examples of volcanoes and isogeny graphs exhibiting unexpected properties ultimately due to our more general setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The mass transference principle of Beresnevich and Velani is a powerful mechanism for determining the Hausdorff dimension/measure of $\limsup$ sets that arise naturally in Diophantine approximation. However, in the setting of dynamical Diophantine approximation, this principle often fails to apply effectively, as the radii of the balls defining the dynamical $\limsup$ sets generally depend on the orbit of the point $x$ itself. In this paper, we develop a dimensional mass transference principle that enables us to recover and extend classical results on shrinking target problems, particularly for the $\beta$-transformation and the Gauss map. Moreover, our result shows that the corresponding $\limsup$ sets have large intersection properties. A potentially interesting feature of our method is that, in many cases, shrinking target problems are closely related to finding an appropriate Gibbs measure, which may reveal new aspects of the link between thermodynamic formalism and dynamical Diophantine approximation.</p></details>

After that, Alanazi, Munagi and Saikia \cite{Alanazi2024} studied and found some congruences for the pairs of $(\ell_1,\ell_2)\in\{(2,3),(4,3),(2,5),(3,5),(4,9),(8,27),\\(16,81)\} $ using the theory of modular forms and Radu's algorithm. Recently Paudel, Sellers and Wang \cite{Paudel2025} extended several of their results and established infinitely many families of new congruences. In this paper, we find infinitely many families of congruences modulo $3$ and powers of $2$ for the pairs $(\ell_1,\ell_2)$ $ \in$ $\{(2,9),(5,2),(5,4),(8,3)\}$ and in general for $ (5,2^t)$ $\forall t\geq3$ and for $ (3,2^t)$,$ (4,3^t)$ $\forall t\geq2$, using the theory of Hecke eigenform, an identity due to Newman and the concept of dissection formulas and generating functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix a prime number $d$. The post-critically finite polynomials of the form $f_{d,c} = x^d+c\in \mathbb{C}[x]$ play a fundamental role in polynomial dynamics. While many results are known in the complex dynamical setting, much less is understood about the arithmetic properties of these polynomials. In this paper, we describe the factorization of the iterates of post-critically finite polynomials $f_{d,c}$ over their fields of definition. As a consequence, we prove new cases of a conjecture of Andrews and Petsche on abelian arboreal Galois representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article generalizes Venkatesh's structure theorem for the derived Hecke action on the Hecke trivial cohomology of a division algebra over an imaginary quadratic field to division algebras over all number fields. In particular, we show that the stable submodule of the Hecke trivial cohomology attached to a division algebra is a free module generated by the unit class for the action of the strict derived Hecke algebra. Moreover, the strict derived Hecke algebra possesses a rational form that preserves the canonical rational structure on the stable cohomology during the derived Hecke action. The main ingredients in our improvement are a careful study of the congruence classes in the torsion cohomology of the arithmetic manifold and the author's new result on the reduction map in the $K$-theory of the ring of integers in number fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The authors define a Category $\mathcal{O}$ for any quasi-reductive Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with respect to a triangular decomposition. This much needed approach unifies many important constructions in the existing literature in a rigorous fashion. Our Category $\mathcal{O}$ encompasses all highest weight categories for Lie (super)algebras as well as specific examples which may not be highest weight categories. When the decomposition arises from a principal parabolic subalgebra $\mathfrak{p}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$, the Category $\mathcal{O}$ exhibits rich homological properties. For one, the authors show that in contrast to the case of a semisimple Lie algebra, the Category $\mathcal{O}$ is standardly stratified. Moreover, the categorical cohomology of $\mathcal{O}$ is a finitely generated ring. This provides a first step towards developing a support variety theory for Category $\mathcal{O}$. Finally, it is shown that the complexity of modules in Category $\mathcal{O}$ is finite with an explicit upper bound given by the dimension of the subspace of the odd degree elements in $\mathfrak{g}$. This upgrades results known for $\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$ to the more general setting. Our arguments are based on foundational connections between the categorical cohomology and the relative Lie superalgebra cohomology as well as the interplay between Category $\mathcal{O}$ for $\mathfrak{g}$ and the Category $\mathcal{O}$ for its corresponding Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_{\bar 0}$.</p></details>

We extend to this setting the result of Gekhtman, Shapiro, and Vainshtein on the Poisson property of Postnikov's boundary measurement map.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose new vertex operators, both the type I and the type II dual, of the elliptic quantum toroidal algebra U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}) by combining representations of U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}) and the notions of the elliptic stable envelopes for the instanton moduli space M(n,r). The vertex operators reproduce the shuffle product formula of the elliptic stable envelopes by their composition. We also show that the vacuum expectation value of a composition of the vertex operators gives a correct formula of the K-theoretic vertex function for M(n,r). We then derive exchange relations among the vertex operators and construct a L-operator satisfying the RLL=LLR^* relation with R and R^* being elliptic dynamical instanton R-matrices defined as transition matrices of the elliptic stable envelopes. Assuming a universal form of L, we define a comultiplication \Delta in terms of it. It turns out that the new vertex operators are intertwining operators of the U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor})-modules w.r.t \Delta.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper explores a theoretical approach to enhance RSA's resistance against quantum attacks by optimizing prime selection through R\'enyi entropy constraints. We develop a framework where primes are generated with controlled proximity ($|p-q| < \gamma\sqrt{pq}$) to minimize the collision entropy $\mathscr{H}_2$ of the quantum period-finding operator. The main contributions include: (1) establishing a connection between prime distribution properties and quantum attack complexity via Maynard's prime gap theorem, (2) providing a constructive proof for prime existence under entropy constraints, and (3) demonstrating security reduction to ideal lattice problems under the quantum random oracle model. Theoretical analysis suggests that for $k$-bit moduli with $\gamma < k^{-1/2+\epsilon}$, Shor's algorithm requires $\Omega(\gamma^{-1}k^{3/2})$ quantum operations while maintaining classical security equivalent to standard RSA. Key Enhancements: (1) Prime existence proof via Maynard's theorem (Theorem 3.1), (2) Ideal lattice embedding for SVP reduction (Theorem 5.3), (3) Quantum Fano bound for information-theoretic analysis (Theorem 6.3), (4) Multi-prime RSA extension (Section 7.3).</p></details>

Next, we introduce the notion of Nijenhuis operators on pre-Lie coalgebras and give their constructions, one from a linearly compatible pre-Lie coalgebra structure, and one from pre-Lie bialgebras. We then obtain a bialgebraic structure on Nijenhuis pre-Lie algebras by using dual representations and study their relations with \sss-equations and $\mathcal{O}$-operators.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In previous papers it has been shown that the coefficients of terms in the large-$N$ expansion of a certain integrated four-point correlator of superconformal primary operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory are rational sums of real-analytic Eisenstein series and "generalised Eisenstein series''. The latter are novel modular functions first encountered in the context of graviton amplitudes in type IIB superstring theory. Similar modular functions, known as two-loop modular graph functions, are also encountered in the low-energy expansion of the integrand of genus-one closed superstring amplitudes. In this paper we further develop the mathematical structure of such generalised Eisenstein series emphasising, in particular, the occurrence of $L$-values of holomorphic cusp forms in their Fourier mode decomposition. We show that both the coefficients in the large-$N$ expansion of the integrated correlator and two-loop modular graph functions admit a unifying description in terms of four-dimensional lattice sums generated by theta lifts of local Maass functions, which generalise the structure of real-analytic Eisenstein series. Through the theta lift representation, we demonstrate that elements belonging to these two families of non-holomorphic modular functions can be expressed as rational linear combinations of generalised Eisenstein series for which all the $L$-values of holomorphic cusp forms precisely cancel.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study central configurations when the set of positions is symmetric. We use a theorem from representation theory of finite groups to explore the symmetry properties of equations for central configurations. This approach simplifies equations for central configurations by considering arbitrary numbers of bodies, symmetry groups, and dimensions. We discuss how to use this theorem to obtain a more refined decomposition of the equations than that given before. The decomposition presented here uses the symmetry-adapted basis method. As an application, we give a complete description of the existence and which masses are possible for central configurations of two nested regular tetrahedrons, two nested regular octahedrons, and two nested regular cubes. To do this, we employ some methods of rational parameterizations and isolation of zeros of multivariate polynomials. The decomposition obtained allows symbolic calculations to be used to study the expressions. This way, we summarize previous discussions and extend them by completing the analysis on the cube case, for both the inverse and direct problems.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the average size of $\mathrm{Cl}_F[2]$ in the family of cubic fields $F = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{n})$. Specifically, as $F$ varies over the subfamily of wildly (resp. tamely) ramified fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{n})$, the average size of $\mathrm{Cl}_F[2]$ is $3/2$ (resp. $2$). This tame/wild dichotomy is not accounted for by the class group heuristics in the literature. Analogously, when the extensions $F = K(\sqrt[3]{n})$ of $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ are ordered by the norm of $n \in \mathcal{O}_K$, we show that the average size of $\mathrm{Cl}_F[2]$ is $3/2$, as is predicted by the Cohen--Martinet heuristics for $C_3$-extensions of $K$. Underlying our proofs is a reciprocity law for the relative class groups $\mathrm{Cl}_{F/K}[2]$ of odd degree extensions of number fields $F/K$. This leads us to propose class group heuristics for families of $K$-extensions with a fixed Galois $K$-group that explains the aberrant behavior in the family $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{n})$ and predicts similar behavior in other special families. The other main ingredient is the work of Alp\"oge--Bhargava--Shnidman on the number of integral $G(\mathbb{Q})$-orbits in a $G$-invariant quadric with bounded invariants.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An invertible matrix is called a Perron similarity if it diagonalizes an irreducible, nonnegative matrix. Each Perron similarity gives a nontrivial polyhedral cone, called the spectracone, and polytope, called the spectratope, of realizable spectra (thought of as vectors in complex Euclidean space). A Perron similarity is called ideal if its spectratope coincides with the conical hulls of its rows. Identifying ideal Perron similarities is of great interest in the pursuit of the longstanding nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem. In this work, it is shown that the character table of a finite group is an ideal Perron similarity. In addition to expanding ideal Perron similarities to include a broad class of matrices, the results unify previous works into a single, theoretical framework. It is demonstrated that the spectracone can be described by finitely-many group-theoretic inequalities. When the character table is real, we derive a group-theoretic formula for the volume of the projected Perron spectratope, which is a simplex. Finally, an implication for further research is given.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel class of prime-generating quadratic polynomials defined by $f_{Z,k,H}(n) = n^2 - (2Zk - 1)n + \frac{(2Zk - 1)^2 + H}{4}$, where $Zk \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ and $H$ belongs to the set of Heegner numbers. This form is closely related to the Euler-Rabinowitsch polynomials through specific substitutions. The structure enables algebraic tuning for prime-rich outputs and provides deeper insight into the impact of Heegner numbers on prime distribution. Using tools such as the Bateman-Horn conjecture and prime-counting functions, we demonstrate that this family can be optimized to generate a high density of primes. This work offers new directions for research in analytic number theory and potential applications in cryptography and signal processing.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study numbers $n$ that can be factored in four different ways as $n = A B = (A + a_1) (B - b_1) = (A + a_2) (B - b_2) = (A + a_3) (B - b_3)$ with $B \le A$, $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < a_3 \le C$ and $1 \le b_1 < b_2 < b_3 \le C$. We obtain the optimal upper bound $A \le 0.04742 \ldots \cdot C^3 + O(C)$. The key idea is to transform the original question into generalized Pell equations $a x^2 - b y^2 = c$ and study their solutions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The motivic coaction of multiple zeta values and multiple polylogarithms encodes both structural insights on and computational methods for scattering amplitudes in a variety of quantum field theories and in string theory. In this work, we propose coaction formulae for iterated integrals over holomorphic Eisenstein series that arise from configuration-space integrals at genus one. Our proposal is motivated by formal similarities between the motivic coaction and the single-valued map of multiple polylogarithms at genus zero that are exposed in their recent reformulations via zeta generators. The genus-one coaction of this work is then proposed by analogies with the construction of single-valued iterated Eisenstein integrals via zeta generators at genus one. We show that our proposal exhibits the expected properties of a coaction and deduce $f$-alphabet decompositions of the multiple modular values obtained from regularized limits.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Grounded partitions, introduced by Dousse and Konan and motivated by the theory of perfect crystals, are combinatorial objects whose generating functions-associated to specific defining matrices-admit infinite product expressions. In this paper, we investigate the combinatorics of grounded partitions at level $2$ in type $A_1^{(1)}$ with exact difference conditions. We provide the first bijective proof that their generating functions are given by infinite products. Furthermore, we show that these partitions carry an affine crystal structure in type $A_1^{(1)}$. By restricting to the finite type $A$ crystal structure, we obtain new infinite sum expressions for the corresponding products. Remarkably, the major index statistic on Yamanouchi words arises naturally within this framework.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we construct the stable derivator associated to a homotopically complete and cocomplete dg-category by explicitly defining homotopy Kan extensions via suitable weighted homotopy limits and colimits in dg-categories. By restricting the domain of the derivator to finite direct categories, we obtain a well-defined derivator even for pretriangulated dg-categories. This definition enables an explicit description of the derivator associated to a weakly idempotent complete Frobenius exact category, leading to a more direct characterization in terms of Gorenstein projective (equivalently, Gorenstein injective) diagrams.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the twisting of motivic $L$-functions by a family of multiplicative characters $\psi$, defined on prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}$ via $\psi(p)=\alpha^{N(\mathfrak{p})}$ for a fixed $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$. One can extend $\psi$ to a continuous non-Hecke character on the idele group of a number field. For $|\alpha|<1$, the resulting $\psi$-twisted $L$-function has interesting analytic properties: an enhanced half-plane of absolute convergence, preservation of the Euler product structure, and meromorphic continuation to the complex plane. We give applications to Dirichlet $L$-functions and $L$-functions associated to modular forms. Furthermore, we show that $\psi$-twisting allows the construction of convergent $p$-adic Dirichlet series and $p$-adic Euler products.</p></details>
