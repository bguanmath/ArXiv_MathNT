### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04397v1'>2509.04397</a>\]&nbsp; **Quantum carrollian bosonic strings**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** José Figueroa-O'Farrill, Emil Have, Niels A. Obers &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** hep-th &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a recently discovered carrollian bosonic string, described classically by a sigma model where both the worldsheet and the target spacetime are carrollian. After fixing the carrollian analogue of the conformal gauge, we determine the Lie algebra of residual gauge symmetries and show it is isomorphic to the three-dimensional extended BMS algebra. We quantise the sigma model \`a la BRST and determine the spectrum of the corresponding string theory by computing the BRST cohomology. In contrast with the usual bosonic string, the spectrum of the carrollian string is finite-dimensional. The cohomology displays Poincar\'e duality and can be interpreted, for a given momentum, as inducing representations for unitary irreducible representations of the 26-dimensional Carroll group. Furthermore we interpret (most of) the cohomology as deformations of the spacetime carrollian structure augmented by the Kalb--Ramond field to which the carrollian string couples.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Starting with a primitive Dirichlet character of conductor $N$, we construct a paramodular Siegel Eisenstein series of level $N^2$ and weight $k\geq4$. We calculate the Fourier expansion of the holomorphic Siegel modular form thus constructed.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Owen Root &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Corrected grammar and typos, strengthened and clarified argument, result unchanged

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Waring's Problem asks whether, for each positive integer $k$, there exists an integer $s$ such that every positive integer is a sum of at most $k$th powers. While Hilbert proved the existence of such $s$, Waring's Problem has lead to areas of related work, namely the function $g(k)$, which denotes the least such $s$. There is no known general closed form for $g(k)$, though for $g(k)$ has been evaluated for small $k$. Prior work has reduced the problem to verifying a particular condition, which if never occurs, implies an expression for $g(k)$. In this paper, I present a proof the condition never occurs, thus fixing the value of $g(k)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages. Typos corrected & some proofs streamlined

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an invariant probability measure for the Gauss map, almost all numbers are Diophantine if the log of the partial quotient function is integrable. We show that with respect to a ``continued fraction mixing'' measure for the Gauss map with the log of the partial quotient function non-integrable, almost all numbers are Liouville. We also exhibit Gauss-invariant, ergodic measures with arbitrary irrationality exponent. The proofs are applications of our study of the ``extravagance'' of positive, stationary, stochastic processes. In addition, we prove a Khinchin-type dichotomy for Diophantine approximation with respect to ergodic``weak Renyi measures'' which are ``doubling at $0$''.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ethan Ackelsberg, Vitaly Bergelson &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 23 pages. The previous version of this arXiv submission has now been split into two articles (the present one dealing with finite fields and another dealing with more general rings, to appear soon)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove new combinatorial results about polynomial configurations in large subsets of finite fields. Bergelson--Leibman--McCutcheon (2005) showed that for any polynomial $P(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ with $P(0) = 0$, if $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q$ is a subset of a $q$-element finite field and $A$ does not contains distinct $a, b$ such that $b - a = P(x)$ for some $x$, then $|A| = o(q)$. In fields of sufficiently large characterstic, the bound $o(q)$ can be improved to $O(q^{1/2})$ by the Weil bound. We match this bound in the low characteristic setting and give a complete algebraic characterization of the class of polynomials for which the Furstenberg--S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy theorem holds over finite fields of fixed characteristic. Our next main result deals with an enhancement of the Furstenberg--S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy theorem over finite fields. Another consequence of the Weil bound is that if $P(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q$, and there do not exist elements $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ with $b - a = P(x)$ for some $x$, then $|A| |B| = O(q)$, provided that the characteristic of $\mathbb{F}_q$ is sufficiently large depending on $P$. We provide a complete description of the family of polynomials for which this asymmetric enhancement holds over fields of fixed characteristic, achieving the same quantitative bounds that are available in the high characteristic setting. The exponential sum estimates that we produce in dealing with the above problems also allow us to establish partition regularity of families of polynomial equations over finite fields. As an example, we prove: if $P(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ with $P(0) = 0$, then for any $r \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists $N = N(P,r)$ and $c = c(P,r) > 0$ such that if $q > N$ and $\mathbb{F}_q = \bigcup_{i=1}^r{C_i}$, then there are at least $cq^2$ monochromatic solutions to the equation $P(x) + P(y) = P(z)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve and $p \geq 3$ a prime. The modular curve $X_E^-(p)$ parametrizes elliptic curves with $p$-torsion modules anti-symplectically isomorphic to $E[p]$. For each $\ell \neq p$, we give conditions, in terms of the type of reduction of $E$ at $\ell$ and standard invariants associated to $E/\mathbb{Q}_\ell$, for $X_E^-(p)(\mathbb{Q}_\ell)$ to be non-empty. Moreover, our conditions completely classify when $X_E^-(p)(\mathbb{Q}_\ell) \neq \emptyset$ except in a special case of good reduction; our main result includes $\ell = p$ when $E$ is semistable at $p$. As an application, we classify CM curves $E/\mathbb{Q}$ where the modular curve $X_E^-(p)$ is a counterexample to the Hasse principle for infinitely many $p$. Assuming the Frey--Mazur conjecture, we prove that for at least $60\%$ of rational elliptic curves $E$, the modular curve $X_E^-(p)$ is a counterexample to the Hasse principle for $50\%$ of primes $p$. Additionally, we simplify several local symplectic criteria in the work of the first author and Alain Kraus.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09121v3'>2503.09121</a>\]&nbsp; **On restricted sumsets with bounded degree relations**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Minghui Ouyang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 14 pages; revised according to referee comments

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given two subsets $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p$ and a binary relation $\mathcal{R} \subseteq A \times B$, the restricted sumset of $A, B$ with respect to $\mathcal{R}$ is defined as $A +_{\mathcal{R}} B = \{ a+b \colon (a,b) \notin \mathcal{R} \}$. When $\mathcal{R}$ is taken as the equality relation, determining the minimum value of $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} B|$ is the famous Erd\H{o}s--Heilbronn problem, which was solved separately by Dias da Silva, Hamidoune and Alon, Nathanson and Ruzsa. Lev later conjectured that if $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p$ with $|A| + |B| \le p$ and $\mathcal{R}$ is a matching between subsets of $A$ and $B$, then $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} B| \ge |A| + |B| - 3$. We confirm this conjecture in the case where $|A| + |B| \le (1-\varepsilon)p$ for any $\varepsilon > 0$, provided that $p > p_0$ for some sufficiently large $p_0$ depending only on $\varepsilon$. Our proof builds on a recent work by Bollob\'as, Leader, and Tiba, and a rectifiability argument developed by Green and Ruzsa. Furthermore, our method extends to cases when $\mathcal{R}$ is a degree-bounded relation, either on both sides $A$ and $B$ or solely on the smaller set. In addition, we construct subsets $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p$ with $|A| = \frac{6p}{11} - O(1)$ such that $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} A| = p-3$ for any prime number $p$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is a matching on $A$. This extends an earlier construction by Lev and highlights a distinction between the combinatorial notion of the restricted sumset and the classcial Erd\H{o}s--Heilbronn problem, where $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} A| \ge p$ holds given $\mathcal{R} = \{(a,a) \colon a \in A\}$ is the equality relation on $A$ and $|A| \ge \frac{p+3}{2}$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sanjaye Ramgoolam, Michał Studziński &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** hep-th &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 78 pages, 15 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Walled Brauer algebras $B_N ( m , n ) $ illuminate the combinatorics of mixed tensor representations of $U(N)$, with $m$ copies of the fundamental and $n$ copies of the anti-fundamental representation. They lie at the intersection of research in representation theory, AdS/CFT and quantum information theory. They have been used to study of correlators in multi-matrix models motivated by brane-anti-brane physics in AdS/CFT. They have been applied in computing and optimising fidelities of port-based quantum teleportation. There is a large $N$ regime, specifically $ N \ge (m+n)$ where the algebras are semi-simple and their representation theory more tractable. There are known combinatorial formulae for dimensions of irreducible representations and associated reduction multiplicities. The large $N$ regime has a stability property whereby these formulae are independent of $N$. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the combinatorics in the non-semisimple regime of $ N = m +n - l $, with positive $l$. We introduce restricted Bratteli diagrams (RBD) which are useful as an instrument to process known data from the large $N$ regime to calculate representation theory data in the non-semisimple regime. We identify within the non-semisimple regime, a region of $(m,n)$-stability, where $ \min ( m, n ) \ge ( 2l -3) $ and the RBD take a stable form depending on $l$ only and not the choice of $ m,n$ within the region. In this regime, several aspects of the combinatorics of the RBD are controlled by a universal partition function for an infinite tower of simple harmonic oscillators closely related, but not identical, to the partition function of 2D non-chiral free scalar field theory.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jian Lu, Wolfgang Steiner, Yuru Zou &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DS &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For two real bases $q_0, q_1 > 1$, a binary sequence $i_1 i_2 \cdots \in \{0,1\}^\infty$ is the $(q_0,q_1)$-expansion of the number $$ \pi_{q_0,q_1}(i_1 i_2 \cdots) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{i_k}{q_{i_1} \cdots q_{i_k}}. $$ Let $U_{q_0,q_1}$ be the set of all real numbers having a unique $(q_0,q_1)$-expansion. When the bases are equal, i.e., $q_0 = q_1 = q$, Allaart and Kong (2019) established the continuity in $q$ of the Hausdorff dimension of the univoque set $U_{q,q}$, building on the work of Komornik, Kong, and Li (2017). We derive explicit formulas for the Hausdorff dimension of $U_{q_0,q_1}$ and the entropy of the underlying subshift for arbitrary $q_0, q_1 > 1$, and prove the continuity of these quantities as functions of $(q_0, q_1)$. Our results also concern general dynamical systems described by binary shifts with a hole, including, in particular, the doubling map with a hole and (linear) Lorenz maps.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** el Houcein el Abdalaoui &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 27 pages. The results of this paper were announced and presented at the international conference "33\`emes Journ\'ees Arithm\'etiques," held at the University of Luxembourg from June 30 to July 4, 2025

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a generalization of Littlewood's criterion on $L^\alpha$-flatness by proving that there is no $L^\alpha$-flat polynomials, $\alpha>0$, within the class of analytic polynomials on the unit circle of the form $ P_n(z)=\sum_{m=1}^{n}c_m z^m, n \in {\mathbb{N}}^*,$ satisfying $$ \sum_{m=1}^{n}|c_m|^2 \leq \frac{K}{n^2} \sum_{m=1}^{n}m^2 |c_m|^2, $$ where $K$ is an absolutely constant. As a consequence, we confirm the $L^\alpha$-Littlewood conjecture, and thereby the $L^1$-Newman and $L^\infty$-Erd\"os conjectures. Our approach combines the $L^\alpha$ Littlewood theorem with the generalized Clarkson's second inequality for $L^\alpha(X,\mathcal{A},m;B)$, with $B$ a Banach spaces and $1 < \alpha \leq 2.$ It follows that there are only finitely many Barker sequences, and we further present several applications in number theory and the spectral theory of dynamical systems. Finally, we construct Gauss-Fresnel polynomials that are Mahler-flat, providing a new proof of the Beller-Newman theorem.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We extend work of Heath-Brown and Salberger, based on the determinant method, to provide a uniform upper bound for the number of integral points of bounded height on an affine surface, which are subject to a polynomial congruence condition. This is applied to get a new uniform bound for points on diagonal quadric surfaces, and to a problem about the representation of integers as a sum of four unlike powers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 9 pages; comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study Chebyshev's bias for the signs of Fourier coefficients of cuspidal newforms on $\Gamma_0(N)$. Our main result shows that the bias towards either sign is completely determined by the order of vanishing of the $L$-function $L(s, f)$ at the central point of the critical strip. We then give several examples of modular forms where we explicitly compute the order of vanishing of $L(s, f)$ at the central point and as a by-product, verify the super-positivity property, in the sense of Yun--Zhang (2017), for these examples.</p></details>

We verify this conjecture for a number of examples.</p></details>

> **Comment:** The main adjustment involves restructuring Section 5

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper aims to employ a cluster-theoretic approach to provide a class of Diophantine equations whose solutions can be obtained by starting from initial solutions through mutations. We establish a novel framework bridging cluster theory and Diophantine equations through the lens of cluster symmetry. On the one hand, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for Laurent polynomials to remain invariant under a given cluster symmetric map. On the other hand, we construct a discriminant algorithm to determine whether a given Laurent polynomial has cluster symmetry and whether it can be realized in a generalized cluster algebra. As applications of this framework, we solve Markov-cluster equations, describe three classes of invariant Laurent polynomial rings, resolve two questions posed by Gyoda and Matsushita, and lastly give two MATLAB programs about our main theorems.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fock and Goncharov introduced a quantization of higher Teichm\"uller theory using cluster Poisson varieties and their noncommutative deformations, associating to a complex semisimple Lie group $G$ and a marked surface $S$ a quantum algebra $\mathbb{L}_{G,S}$ equipped with an action of the surface mapping class group. They conjectured that these quantizations form an algebraic analog of a modular functor: cutting a surface along a simple closed curve should correspond to a canonical gluing isomorphism for the associated algebras. In this paper we prove this conjecture for $G = \mathrm{PGL}_{n+1}$. Our approach requires two extensions of the Fock-Goncharov framework: (1) enhanced moduli spaces incorporating additional boundary data, providing algebro-geometric analogs of Fenchel-Nielsen twist coordinates; and (2) the residue universal Laurent ring, a refinement of the quantum universal Laurent ring obtained by localizing and imposing residue conditions. Using these tools, we construct canonical cutting isomorphisms that are equivariant under mapping class group actions and suffice to reconstruct the entire algebra $\mathbb{L}_{G,S}$ from data associated to the cut surface.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Kronecker sequences $(k \alpha \mod 1)_{k=1}^{\infty}$ for some irrational $\alpha > 0$ have played an important role in many areas of mathematics. It is possible to associate to each finite segment $(k \alpha \mod 1)_{k=1}^{n}$ a permutation $\pi \in S_n$ associated with the canonical lifting to two dimensions. We show that these permutations induced by Kronecker sequences based on irrational $\alpha$ are extremely regular for specific choices of $n$ and $\alpha$. In particular, all quadratic irrationals have an infinite number of choices of $n$ that lead to permutations where no cycle has length more than 4.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This version corrects minor errors in valuation bookkeeping

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For each $n\geq 1$, we express the partition function $p(n)$ as a CM trace on $X_0(6)$ of the discriminant $\Delta_n:=1-24n$ invariants of a weight 0 weak Maass function $P$ that records where CM elliptic curves sit on $X(1)$, together with their canonical first-order "CM tangent'', the diagonal local slope of the CM isogeny relation on $X(1)\times X(1)$. In this viewpoint, we obtain a formula for $p(n)\!\!\pmod{\ell},$ when $\ell$ is inert in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta_n}),$ as a Brandt-module pairing $\langle u_{\Delta_n},v_P\rangle$ that is assembled from oriented optimal embeddings of Eichler orders. For $\ell \in \{5, 7, 11\}$ and $j\geq 1$, we obtain a new proof of the Ramanujan congruences $$ p(5^j n +\beta_5(j))\equiv 0\pmod{5^j}, $$ $$ p(7^j n +\beta_7(j))\equiv 0\pmod{7^{ [ j/2]+1}}, $$ $$ p(11^jn+\beta_{11}(j))\equiv 0\pmod{11^j}, $$ where $\beta_m(j)$ is the unique residue $0\le \beta<m^j$ with $24\,\beta_m(j)\equiv 1\pmod{m^j}$. The key point is a "bonus valuation" that stems from the fact that the supersingular locus of $X_0(6)_{\mathbb{F}_{\ell}}$ lies over $\{0, 1728\}$ for $\ell \in \{5, 7, 11\}.$ This special property, combined with the uniform growth of the $\lambda$-adic valuations of the number of oriented optimal embeddings, explains these congruences. More generally, we give a portable genus 0 template showing that the Watson--Atkin $U_\ell$-contraction works uniformly for suitable traces of singular moduli for genus 0 modular curves with $\ell\nmid N.$</p></details>

> **Comment:** 26 pages, comments are highly welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we first introduce associative-Yamaguti algebras as the associative analogue of Lie-Yamaguti algebras. Associative algebras, reductive associative algebras and associative triple systems of the first kind form subclasses of associative-Yamaguti algebras. Any diassociative algebra canonically provides an associative-Yamaguti algebra structure. We confirm that any associative-Yamaguti algebra admits an enveloping associative algebra (i.e., it can be obtained from a reductive associative algebra). We show that a suitable skew-symmetrization of an associative-Yamaguti algebra gives rise to a Lie-Yamaguti algebra structure. Next, we define the $(2,3)$-cohomology group of an associative-Yamaguti algebra to study formal one-parameter deformations and abelian extensions. Later, we consider Yamaguti multiplications on a nonsymmetric operad as a generalization of associative-Yamaguti algebras. This notion further leads us to introduce dendriform-Yamaguti algebras, which are splitting objects for associative-Yamaguti algebras. Finally, we consider relative Rota-Baxter operators on associative-Yamaguti algebras to establish close relationships with dendriform-Yamaguti algebras.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 51 pages, 6 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The U-dualities of maximally supersymmetric non-chiral supergravity (SUGRA) theories lead to strong constraints on the non-perturbative structure of quantum gravity. In this paper we determine Spin- and Pin-lifts of these dualities, which extend this action to fermionic degrees of freedom. Among other things, this allows us to access non-supersymmetric sectors of these low energy effective field theories in which bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom are treated differently. We use this refinement of the duality groups, in tandem with the Swampland Cobordism Conjecture, to predict new codimension-two branes. These are a natural generalization of the recently discovered R7-branes of type II string theories. The first bordism groups for Spin-twisted duality bundles follow directly from the Abelianization of the duality groups. Viewing the SUGRA theory as the low energy limit of a toroidal compactification of M-theory, winding around these codimension-two defects enacts a reflection around one of the torus directions, which in the effective field theory appears as a charge conjugation symmetry. We establish some basic properties of such branes, including determining BPS objects which can end on it, as well as braiding rules and bound states realized by multiple reflection branes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that there exists an absolute constant $\gamma>0$ such that for every $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ we have $$\min_{x\in [0, 2\pi]}\sum_{a\in A}\cos(ax)\leq -\Omega(|A|^{\gamma}).$$ This gives the first polynomial bound for Chowla's cosine problem from 1965. To show this, we prove structural statements about graphs whose smallest eigenvalue is small in absolute value. As another application, we show that any graph $G$ with $m$ edges and no clique of size $m^{1/2-\delta}$ has a cut of size least $m/2+m^{1/2+\varepsilon}$ for some $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(\delta)>0$. This proves a weak version of a celebrated conjecture of Alon, Bollob\'as, Krivelevich, and Sudakov. Our proofs are based on novel spectral and linear algebraic techniques, involving subspace compressions and Hadamard products of matrices.</p></details>

This correction affects the combined exponent alpha_K and the final expression for the region of absolute convergence, R_abs (Theorem 4.3). The abstract and introduction have been revised accordingly

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper constructs a weight-shifting integral operator, U_{k,t}, that maps the space of weight-k Maass forms to the space of weight-t functions for the full modular group SL(2, Z). The operator is defined as an integral transform whose kernel, K_{k,t,q}, is the product of a specially designed covariant factor P and a modular invariant function F. The central hypothesis of our method is that the kernel itself must be an eigenfunction of the weight-t hyperbolic Laplacian Delta_t with respect to its first variable. We show that this spectral condition reduces the problem of determining the invariant function F to a second-order ordinary differential equation. The principal result of this work is the identification of this ODE as a Papperitz-Riemann equation, which is then transformed into the standard Gauss Hypergeometric Differential Equation. We provide an explicit determination of the hypergeometric parameters (a,b,c) in terms of the initial automorphic data. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of the operator's convergence, rigorously establishing the region of absolute convergence in the parameter space by examining the asymptotic behavior of the kernel. The emergence of the hypergeometric structure suggests a deep connection between these weight-shifting operators and the theory of hypergeometric motives in arithmetic geometry, a principle supported by the recovery of the periods of the Legendre family of elliptic curves in a specific case.</p></details>

> **Comment:** New version (27 pages), various minor edits and corrected typos. Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>To apply the Euler system method to a $p$-adic Galois representation $T$, one needs the existence of a $\sigma \in G_{\mathbb{Q}(\mu_{p^{\infty}})}$ such that $V/(\sigma-1)V$ is free of rank one over the coefficient ring: we say that such a $\sigma$ is an Euler-suitable element for $V$. Given a non-CM classical newform $f$ of weight $k \geq 2$ and character $\chi$, a classical newform $g$ of weight $1$ and character $\psi$, and a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of residue characteristic $p$ of a sufficiently large number field, we consider the situation where $V=V_{f,g,\mathfrak{p}}$ is the tensor product of the $\mathfrak{p}$-adic representations attached to $f$ and $g$. D. Loeffler asked the following question: is is true that if $\chi\psi \neq 1$, then there is an Euler-suitable element for $V_{f,g,\mathfrak{p}}$ for all but finitely many $\mathfrak{p}$? He gave a positive answer when $f,g$ had coprime conductors. We give several weaker sufficient conditions to answer this question in the affirmative. As an application, we remove some of the technical assumptions in the version of the Bloch-Kato Conjecture proved in arXiv:1503.02888. We also show that the general answer to the question is negative, by constructing a family of counter-examples, and giving additional counter-examples that do not fit in this family.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, the problem of multiplicative anomaly of zeta regularization is solved for polynomials. For a regularizable sequence $\Lambda$, we explicitly calculate the zeta regularized product of $(\Lambda-z_1)\dots(\Lambda-z_n)$ for $z_1,\dots,z_n\in\mathbb{C}$. We give an explicit formula for the discrepancies between polynomials. Our results imply Mizuno's theorem as a special case. We furthermore give novel regularized product formulas for multi-dimensional products in terms of Barnes multiple gamma functions, zeros of the Riemann zeta function and zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article presents a comprehensive data-scientific investigation into the arithmetic statistics of congruent number elliptic curves, leveraging a dataset of square-free integers up to $3$ million. We analyze the Mordell-Weil ranks, 2-Selmer ranks, and 3-Selmer ranks of the corresponding elliptic curves $E_D: y^2 = x^3 - D^2x$, where $D$ is a square-free number. Our study empirically examines the Heath-Brown heuristics, which predict the distribution of $2$-Selmer ranks as well as congruent numbers based on their residue modulo $8$. In particular, offering statistical insights into the proportion of numbers whose associated elliptic curves have positive rank. We provide a rigorous verification of Goldfeld's Conjecture in this context, analyzing the distribution of analytic ranks and demonstrating their alignment with the conjectured $50/50$ split for ranks $0$ and $1$. Furthermore, we explore the conjectural asymptotic distribution of $2-$ and $3$-torsion part of the Tate-Shafarevich group of these curves. Based on empirical evidence, we also suggest potential statistical distribution of $3$-Selmer and Mordell-Weil ranks. We also examine the averages of Frobenius traces and observe that they tend to zero without exhibiting any murmuration-like patterns. In addition to these number-theoretic analyses, we apply machine learning techniques to classify and predict congruent numbers, exploring the efficacy of computational methods in distinguishing congruent from non-congruent numbers based on the arithmetic properties of elliptic curves. This interdisciplinary approach blends advanced number theory with modern data science, providing empirical support for conjectures as well as discovery of new patterns.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is known that a large class of characters of 2d conformal field theories (CFTs) can be written in the form of a Nahm sum. In \cite{Zagier:2007knq}, D. Zagier identified a list of Nahm sum expressions that are modular functions under a congruence subgroup of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and can be thought of as candidates for characters of rational CFTs. Motivated by the observation that the same formulas appear as the half-indices of certain 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories, we perform a general search over low-rank 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ abelian Chern-Simons matter theories which either flow to unitary TFTs or $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-zero SCFTs in the infrared. These are exceptional classes of 3d theories, which are expected to support rational and $C_2$-cofinite chiral algebras on their boundary. We compare and contrast our results with Zagier's and comment on a possible generalization of Nahm's conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The existence of a tilting or silting object is an important feature for an algebraic triangulated category since it gives an equivalence with the derived category of a ring. By applying tilting theory, we study Cohen-Macaulay representations of Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras $A$, where do not assume that $A_0$ is a field. This is a large class of noncommutative Gorenstein rings containing Gorenstein orders. In this paper, we concentrate on the case where $A$ has dimension one. We prove that the stable category $\mathrm{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}_0^{\mathbb Z}A$ admits a silting object if and only if $A_0$ has finite global dimension. In this case, we give a silting object explicitly. Moreover, under the additional assumption that $A$ is ring-indecomposable, we prove that it admits a tilting object if and only if either $A$ is Artin-Schelter regular or the average Gorenstein parameter of $A$ is non-positive. These results are far-reaching generalizations of the results of Buchweitz, Iyama, and Yamaura. We give two different proofs of the second result; one is based on Orlov-type semiorthogonal decompositions, and the other is based on a more direct calculation. We apply our results to a Gorenstein tiled order $A$ to prove that $\mathrm{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}^{\mathbb Z}A$ is equivalent to the derived category of the incidence algebra of an (explicitly constructed) poset. We also apply our results and Koszul duality to study smooth noncommutative quadric hypersurfaces $\mathrm{\mathsf{qgr}} B$ of arbitrary dimension. We prove that the derived category $\mathsf{D}^b(\mathrm{\mathsf{qgr}} B)$ admits an (explicitly constructed) tilting object. Through Orlov's semiorthogonal decomposition, our tilting object has the tilting object of $\mathrm{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}^{\mathbb Z}B$ due to Smith and Van den Bergh as a direct summand.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra. We prove the convergence of Segal's sewing of conformal blocks associated to analytic families of pointed compact Riemann surfaces and grading-restricted generalized $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$-modules (where $N=1,2,\dots$) that are not necessarily tensor products of $\mathbb V$-modules, generalizing significantly the results on convergence in [Gui24]. We show that ``higher genus pseudo-$q$-traces" (called pseudo-sewing in this article) can be recovered from the above generalization of Segal's sewing to $\mathbb{V}^{\otimes N}$-modules. Therefore, our result on the convergence of the generalized Segal's sewing implies the convergence of pseudo-sewing, and hence covers both the convergence of genus-$0$ sewing in [Hua05a,HLZ12] and the convergence of pseudo-$q$-traces in [Miy04] and [Fio16]. Using a similar method, we also prove the convergence of Virasoro uniformization, i.e., the convergence of conformal blocks deformed by non-automomous meromorphic vector fields near the marked points. The local freeness of the analytic sheaves of conformal blocks is a consequence of this convergence. It will be used in the third paper of this series to prove the sewing-factorization theorem.</p></details>

For even-order abelian groups, a standard $|G|/2$ lower bound applies. We prove this is optimal for $G = (\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z})^n$ using a pair-counting argument, with an explicit construction of vectors with first coordinate odd (1 or 3 mod 4), yielding size $2 \times 4^{n-1} = 4^n / 2$ and density 0.5, verified for $n \leq 10$. An AI-assisted hybrid greedy-genetic algorithm rediscovers this optimal size, highlighting its potential in combinatorial search.</p></details>

In other words, for any fixed large bases, there are infinitely many $n$ such that almost all of the digits of $n$ are small in all bases simultaneously. This is both a quantitative and qualitative improvement over previous work of Croot, Mousavi, and Schmidt.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Amdeberhan recently proposed certain equalities between sums in the character table of symmetric groups. These equalities are between signed column sums in the character table, summing over the rows labeled by partitions in $\Ev$, where $\lambda$ is a partition of $n$ with $r$ nonzero parts and $\Ev$ is a multiset containing $2^r$ partitions of $2n$. While we observe that these equalities are not true in general, we prove that they do hold in interesting special cases. These lead to new equalities between sums of degrees of irreducible characters for the symmetric group and a new combinatorial interpretation for the Riordan numbers in terms of degrees of irreducible characters labeled by partitions with three parts of the same parity. This is the first, to our knowledge, theorem about degrees of symmetric group characters with parity conditions imposed on the partitions indexing the characters.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Ramanujan's 1920 last letter to Hardy contains seventeen examples of mock theta functions which he organized into three "orders." The most famous of these is the third-order function $f(q)$ which has received the most attention of any individual mock theta function in the intervening century. In 1964, Andrews--improving on a result of Dragonette--gave an asymptotic formula for the coefficients of $f(q)$ and conjectured an exact formula for the coefficients: a conditionally convergent series that closely resembles the Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher formula for the partition function. To prove that the conjectured series converges, it is necessary to carefully measure the cancellation among the Kloosterman sums appearing in the formula. Andrews' conjecture was proved four decades later by Bringmann and Ono. Here we prove exact formulas for all seventeen of the mock theta functions appearing in Ramanujan's last letter. Along the way, we prove a general theorem bounding sums of Kloosterman sums for the Weil representation attached to a lattice of odd rank.</p></details>

In the case of minimum-length factorizations, the resulting answer is a striking product formula resembling the count for minimum-length factorizations of Coxeter elements into reflections in complex reflections groups. Moreover, for minimum length, the answers for the unitary and linear groups exhibit the phenomenon of Ennola duality, where the number of factorizations in a unitary group over the field $\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by replacing `$q$' with `$-q$' in the corresponding answer for a linear group.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that any finite abelian group $G$ contains a collection of not too many subsets with a special structure, so that for every subset $A$ of $G$ with a small doubling, there is a member $F$ of the collection that is fully contained in the sumset $A+A$ and is not much smaller than it. Using this result we obtain improved bounds for the problem of estimating the typical independence number of sparse random Cayley or Cayley-sum graphs, and for the problem of estimating the smallest size of a subset of $G$ which is not a sumset. We also obtain tight bounds for the typical maximum length of an arithmetic progression in the sumset of a sparse random subset of $G$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a compact abelian group and $\phi_1, \phi_2, \phi_3$ be continuous endomorphisms on $G$. Under certain natural assumptions on the $\phi_i$'s, we prove the existence of Bohr sets in the sumset $\phi_1(A) + \phi_2(A) + \phi_3(A)$, where $A$ is either a set of positive Haar measure, or comes from a finite partition of $G$. The first result generalizes theorems of Bogolyubov and Bergelson-Ruzsa. As a variant of the second result, we show that for any partition $\mathbb{Z} = \bigcup_{i=1}^r A_i$, there exists an $i$ such that $A_i - A_i + sA_i$ contains a Bohr set for any $s \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{ 0 \}$. The latter is a step toward an open question of Katznelson and Ruzsa.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod $n$ homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}.$ As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod $n$ homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected and area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>If $p\geq 5$ is prime and $k\geq 4$ is an even integer with $(p-1)\nmid k$ we consider the Eisenstein series $G_k$ on $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ modulo powers of $p$. It is classically known that for such $k$ we have $G_k\equiv G_{k'}\pmod p$ if $k\equiv k'\pmod{p-1}$. Here we obtain a generalization modulo prime powers $p^m$ by giving an expression for $G_k\pmod{p^m}$ in terms of modular forms of weight at most $mp$. As an application we extend a recent result of the first author with Hanson, Raum and Richter by showing that, modulo powers of $E_{p-1}$, every such Eisenstein series is congruent modulo $p^m$ to a modular form of weight at most $mp$. We prove a similar result for the normalized Eisenstein series $E_k$ in the case that $(p-1)\mid k$ and $m<p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study two types of problems for polynomial Farey fractions. For a positive integer $Q$, and polynomial $P(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[X]$ with $P(0)=0$, we define polynomial Farey fractions as $$\mathcal{F}_{Q,P}:=\left\{\frac{a}{q}: 1\leq a\leq q\leq Q,\ \gcd (P(a),q)=1\right\}.$$ The classical Farey fractions are obtained by considering $P(x)=x$. In this article, we determine the global and local distribution of the sequence of polynomial Farey fractions via discrepancy and pair correlation measure, respectively. In particular, we establish that the sequence of polynomial Farey fractions is uniformly distributed modulo one and show that the limit superior of the pair correlation measure of $(\mathcal{F}_{Q,P})_{Q\ge1}$ is bounded. For the specific polynomial $P(x)=x(x+1)$, we show the existence of the limiting pair correlation measure of $(\mathcal{F}_{Q,P})_{Q\ge1}$ and also provide an explicit formula for the pair correlation function which is non-Poissonian. Further, restricting the polynomial Farey denominators to certain subsets of primes, we explicitly find the pair correlation measure and show it to be Poissonian. Finally, we study Chebyshev's bias type of questions for the classical and polynomial Farey denominators along arithmetic progressions and obtain an $\Omega$-result for the error term of its counting function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates the distribution of rational and algebraic points of bounded weighted height in weighted projective spaces over number fields. For a weighted projective space with weights q over a number field k of degree m, we derive an asymptotic formula for the count of such points, featuring a leading term D times X raised to m e Q, plus an error term, where e is the extension degree and Q is the sum of the weights. The constant D combines geometric aspects of the weights with an arithmetic obstruction given by the reciprocal of the gcd of the least common multiple of the weights and Euler's totient of m e. This obstruction stems from the non-surjectivity of the natural morphism from the weighted space to ordinary projective space on rational points, linked to nontrivial torsors under groups of roots of unity. We provide a cohomological interpretation, analogous to the Brauer-Manin obstruction. These findings refine a weighted version of the Batyrev-Manin conjecture and open avenues for applications in moduli theory and arithmetic geometry.</p></details>

Crucially, the previous article was conditional on strong non-vanishing results for twists of $L$-functions; this condition has now been removed

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The present paper is devoted to the relations between Deligne's conjecture on critical values of motivic $L$-functions and the multiplicative relations between periods of arithmetically normalized automorphic forms on unitary groups. As an application of our main result, we establish Deligne's conjecture for a class of CM-automorphic motives, which we construct in this paper. Our proof uses the results of our recent joint work with Raghuram in combination with the Ichino--Ikeda--Neal-Harris (IINH) formula for unitary groups -- which is now a theorem -- and an analysis of cup products of coherent cohomological automorphic forms on Shimura varieties to establish relations between certain automorphic periods and critical values of Rankin-Selberg and Asai $L$-functions of $\GL(n)\times\GL(m)$ over CM fields. By reinterpreting these critical values in terms of automorphic periods of holomorphic automorphic forms on unitary groups, we show that the automorphic periods of holomorphic forms can be factored as products of coherent cohomological forms, compatibly with a motivic factorization predicted by the Tate conjecture. All of these results are stated under a certain regularity condition and an hypothesis of rationality on archimedean zeta-integrals.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For Atkin-Lehner quotients $X_0^+(N)$, of prime level and of genus at least 2, we provide an algorithm for computing one of the main objects in the quadratic Chabauty algorithm in terms of weakly holomorphic modular forms associated to the curve. In particular, the algorithm computes a Hodge filtration on a certain unipotent vector bundle with connection related to $X_0^+(N)$, which is crucial in computing the $p$-adic height which is used to define the finite set of $p$-adic points containing the rational points on $X_0^+(N)$. This improves the current Hodge filtration algorithm by replacing the input of an explicit plane model of the curve with weakly holomorphic modular forms to produce a faster computation. We implement our algorithm on the genus 7 modular curve $X_0^+(193)$, and discover congruences between iterated integrals of weight 2 cusp forms in the plus eigenspace for the Atkin-Lehner involution and single integrals of weight 2 cusp forms in the minus eigenspace for the Atkin-Lehner involution.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article proposes a new approach to studying the spectral Eisenstein series of weight $k$ on a congruence subgroup of $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ using Hecke's theory of Eisenstein series for the principal congruence subgroups. Our method provides a gateway to analytic and arithmetic properties of the spectral Eisenstein series using corresponding results for the principal congruence subgroup. We show that the specializations of the weight $k$ spectral Eisenstein series at $s = 0$ give rise to a basis for the space of Eisenstein series on a general congruence subgroup, and the Fourier coefficients of the basis elements lie in a cyclotomic number field. Our philosophy also yields an explicit basis parameterized by cusps for the space of Eisenstein series with a nebentypus character. We utilize the spectral basis for the space of Eisenstein series to provide a simple proof of the Eichler-Shimura isomorphism theorem for the entire space of modular forms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $n \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2}$. We prove that for every $k \geq 4$ there exist uniform but non-homogeneous Steiner bundles on $\mathbb{P}^n$ of $k$-type with disconnected splitting type, and we further investigate almost-uniform Steiner bundles. Our approach relies on interpreting Steiner bundles as relative projective Kronecker representations and applying adjoint pairs arising from restriction, inflation, and reflection functors.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article provides an overview of the techniques related to classification of spherical and more general objects within triangulated categories, and its relationship with algebraic geometry, representation theory and symplectic geometry. The primary focus are the techniques of the authors within the 'finite' algebraic geometry setting in dimensions two and three, and within silting discrete algebras, but other approaches including to more general settings by Bapat-Deopurkar-Licata, Smith-Wemyss, Ishii-Ueda, Keating-Smith and Shimpi are also surveyed, in varying levels of detail. Various explicit examples are provided.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates the dynamical properties of Dickson polynomials over finite fields, focusing on the periodicity and structural behavior of their iterated sequences. We introduce and analyze the sequence $[D_n(x, \alpha) \mod (x^q - x)]_n$, where $D_n(x, \alpha)$ denotes a Dickson polynomial of the first kind, and explore its periodic nature when reduced modulo $x^q - x$. We derive explicit formulas for the period of these sequences, particularly in the case when $n$ is coprime to $q^2 - 1$. In addition, we identify a symmetric property of the polynomial coefficients that plays a crucial role in the analysis of these sequences. Using tools from combinatorics, elementary number theory, and finite fields, we present algorithms to compute the exact period and investigate the dynamical structure of these polynomials. We also highlight open problems in cases where the degree $n$ is not coprime to $q^2 - 1$. Our results offer deep insights into the algebraic structure of Dickson polynomials and their role in dynamical systems over finite fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the balanced multiple q-zeta values. They give a new model for multiple q-zeta values, whose product formula combines the shuffle and stuffle product for multiple zeta values in a natural way. Moreover, the balanced multiple q-zeta values are invariant under a very explicit involution. Thus, all relations among the balanced multiple q-zeta values are conjecturally of a very simple shape. Examples of the balanced multiple q-zeta values are the classical Eisenstein series, and they also contain the combinatorial multiple Eisenstein series. The construction of the balanced multiple q-zeta values is done on the level of generating series. We introduce a general setup relating Hoffman's quasi-shuffle products to explicit symmetries among generating series of words, which gives a clarifying approach to Ecalle's theory of bimoulds. This allows us to obtain an isomorphism between the underlying Hopf algebras of words related to the combinatorial bi-multiple Eisenstein series and the balanced multiple q-zeta values.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present the $\tau$-invariant balanced quasi-shuffle algebra $\mathcal{G}^{\mathrm{f}}$, whose elements formalize (combinatorial) multiple Eisenstein series as well as multiple q-zeta values. In particular, $\mathcal{G}^{\mathrm{f}}$ has natural maps into these two algebras, and we expect these maps to be isomorphisms. Racinet studied the algebra $\mathcal{Z}^f$ of formal multiple zeta values by examining the corresponding affine scheme DM. Similarly, we present the affine scheme BM corresponding to the algebra $\mathcal{G}^{\mathrm{f}}$. We show that Racinet's affine scheme DM embeds into our affine scheme BM. This leads to a projection from the algebra $\mathcal{G}^{\mathrm{f}}$ onto $\mathcal{Z}^f$. Via the above natural maps, this projection corresponds to extracting the constant terms of multiple Eisenstein series or the limit $q\to1$ of multiple q-zeta values.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is well known that there is a deep relationship between codes and lattices. Concepts from coding theory are related to concepts of lattice theory as, for example, weight enumerators to theta series, MacWilliams identity to Jacobi identity, and Gleason's theorem to Hecke's theorem. In this framework, higher-genus (or multiple) weight enumerators are related to Siegel theta series, which opens up the possibility of introducing concepts from the theory of higher-rank modular forms to coding theory. There has been important work in this direction, for example Runge introduced a coding theory analogue of Siegel's $\Phi$-operator and Nebe analogues of Hecke operators. In this paper, we show that the celebrated Doubling Method from the theory of higher-rank modular forms has a coding theory analogue. Given the impact that the Doubling Method has had in the study of higher-rank modular forms, one may expect that its analogue may prove useful to the study of higher-genus weight enumerators. In this paper we use it to solve an analogue of the "basis problem". That is, we express "cuspidal" polynomials which are invariant under a Clifford-Weil type group as an explicit linear combination of higher-genus weight enumerators of self-dual codes of that type.</p></details>
