 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Daniel Barake, Owen Chuchman, Cameron Franc, Geoffrey Mason, Brett Nasserden &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper describes the vector bundle on the elliptic modular curve that is associated to a vertex operator algebra $V$ (VOA) or more generally a quasi-vertex operator algebra (QVOA), with a view towards future applications aimed at studying the characters of VOAs. We explain how the modes of sections of $V$ give rise naturally to $V$-valued quasi-modular forms. The space $Q(V)$ of $V$-valued quasi-modular forms is endowed with the structure of a doubled QVOA, and in particular the algebra $Q$ of quasi-modular forms is itself a doubled QVOA. $Q(V)$ also admits a natural derivative operator arising from the connection on the bundle defined by $V$ and the modular derivative, which we call the raising operator. We introduce an associated lowering operator $Λ$ on $Q(V)$ having the property that the $V$-valued modular forms $M(V)\subseteq Q(V)$ are the kernel of $Λ$. This extends the classical theory of scalar-valued quasi-modular forms. We exhibit an explicit isomorphism of $M(V)$ with $M \otimes V$. Finally, the coordinate invariance of vertex operators implies that $M(V)$ has a natural Hecke theory, and we use this isomorphism to fully describe the Hecke eigensystems: they are the same as the systems of eigenvalues that arise from scalar-valued quasi-modular forms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{o}$ be the ring of integers of a non-archimedean local field with residue field of odd characteristic, $\mathfrak{p}$ be its maximal ideal and let $\mathfrak{o}_\ell = \mathfrak{o}/\mathfrak{p}^\ell$ for $\ell\ge 2$. In this article, we study real-valued characters and real representations of the finite groups $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathfrak{o}_\ell)$ and $\mathrm{GU}_2(\mathfrak{o}_\ell)$. We give a complete classification of real and strongly real classes of these groups and characterize the real-valued irreducible complex characters. We prove that every real-valued irreducible complex character of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathfrak{o}_\ell)$ is afforded by a representation over $\mathbb{R}$. In contrast, we show that $\mathrm{GU}_2(\mathfrak{o}_\ell)$ admits real-valued irreducible characters that are not realizable over $\mathbb{R}$. These results extend the parallel known phenomena for the finite groups $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $\mathrm{GU}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the \emph{chamber zeta function} for a complex of groups, defined via an Euler product over primitive tailless chamber galleries, extending the Ihara--Bass framework from weighted graphs to higher-rank settings. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the Bruhat--Tits building of $\mathrm{PGL}_{3}(F)$ for a non-archimedean local field $F$ with residue field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. For the standard arithmetic quotient $Γ\backslash\mathcal{B}$ with $Γ=\mathrm{PGL}_{3}(\mathbb{F}_{q}[t])$, we prove an Ihara--Bass type \emph{determinant formula} expressing the chamber zeta function as the reciprocal of a characteristic polynomial of a naturally defined chamber transfer operator. In particular, the chamber zeta function is \emph{rational} in its complex parameter. As an application of the determinant formula, we obtain explicit counting results for closed gallery classes arising from tailless galleries in $\mathcal{B}$, including exact identities and spectral asymptotics governed by the chamber operator.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish an extension of Viennot's geometric (shadow line) construction to the setting of oscillating tableaux. We then use this to give a new proof of the Type $C$ analogue of Schensted's theorem on longest decreasing subsequences. This pairs with our results from arXiv:2103.14997v1 [math.RT] on Type $C$ webs to give a direct proof of a result of Sundaram and Stanley: that the dimension of the space of invariant vectors in a $2k$-fold tensor product of the vector representation of $\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$ equals the number of $(n+1)$-avoiding matchings of $2k$ points.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Brian Kintu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 16 pages, rewritten to make more insightful, and any comments are very welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this follow-up paper, we again inspect a surprising connection between the set of fixed points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d,c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d,c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ and the coefficient $c$, where $K$ is any number field of degree $n > 1$ and $d > 2$ is an integer. As before, we wish to study counting problems which are inspired by exciting advances in arithmetic statistics, and again partly by point-counting result of Narkiewicz on real $K$-rational periodic points of any odd degree map $\varphi_{d,c}$ in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any real algebraic number field $K$ of degree $n \geq 2$, and for any prime $p \geq 3$ and integer $\ell \geq 1$, the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell},c}$ modulo prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is $3$ or $0$ as $c\to \infty$. Motivated further by $K$-rational periodic point-counting result of Benedetto on any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell},c}$ for any prime $p \geq 5$ and integer $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove unconditionally that for any number field (not necessarily real) $K$ of degree $n \geq 2$, the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell},c}$ modulo prime $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$ as $c\to \infty$. Finally, we then apply density and number field-counting results from arithmetic statistics, and as a result obtain counting and statistical results on irreducible polynomials and number fields arising naturally in our polynomial discrete dynamical settings.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yazan Alamoudi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, I utilize a variant of the Selberg--Delange method to find quantitative estimates of the sums $$M_{k,ω}(x,y)=\sum_{\substack{p_{1}(n)> y\\ n\leq x} } μ(n) {ω(n)-1\choose k-1},$$ where $y$ can grow with $x$ but we must have $y\leq Y_0\exp(\mathscr{p}\frac{\log x}{(\log\log (x+1))^{1+ε}})$ with $Y_0,\mathscr{p},ε>0$. Moreover, I give preliminary upper bounds for the general range $1.9\leq y\leq x^{\frac{1}{k}}$. In addition, I formalize the notions of subradical and radical dominance and discuss their relevance to the analytic approach of the study of arithmetic functions. Lastly, I give a fascinating formula related to the derivatives of the gamma function and the Hankel contour, which should be relevant for those employing the Selberg--Delange method to obtain higher-order terms.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Brian Kintu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages, rewritten to make more insightful, and any comments are very welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this first article of a multi-part series, we inspect a surprising relationship between the set of fixed points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathbb{Z}$ and the coefficient $c$, where $d > 2$ is an integer. Inspired greatly by the elegant counting problems along with the very striking results of Bhargava-Shankar-Tsimerman and their collaborators in arithmetic statistics, and also by interesting point-counting result of Narkiewicz on rational periodic points of any odd degree map $\varphi_{d, c}$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then first prove that for any prime $p\geq 3$, the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{p, c}$ modulo $p$ is $3$ or $0$ as $c$ tends to infinity. Inspired further by a conjecture of Hutz on rational periodic points of $\varphi_{p-1, c}$ for any prime $p\geq 5$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove that the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{p-1, c}$ modulo $p$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$ as $c\to \infty$. Finally, we then apply density and number field-counting results from arithmetic statistics, and as a result obtain counting and statistical results on the irreducible integer polynomials and number fields arising naturally in our polynomial discrete dynamical settings.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Khanh Nguyen Duc &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 23 pages, 4 tables, 2 pictures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give an explicit combinatorial description of the function $f(n)$ governing the Steenrod length of real projective spaces $\mathbb{RP}^n$. This function arises in stable homotopy theory through the action of Steenrod squares on mod-$2$ cohomology and is closely related to the ghost length, which measures the minimal number of spheres required to construct a space up to homotopy. Building on the directed graphs $T_n$ introduced by Vakil to encode degree constraints for Steenrod operations, we interpret $f(n)$ as the length of the longest directed path starting at $n$. Using this framework, we resolve a question posed by Vakil by deriving concrete combinatorial formulas for $f(n)$ in terms of binary classes and a distinguished family of integers, which we call Vakil numbers.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nat Sothanaphan &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 14 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a writeup of a resolution of Erdős Problem #728; this is the first Erdős problem (a problem proposed by Paul Erdős which has been collected in the Erdős Problems website) regarded as fully resolved autonomously by an AI system. The system in question is a combination of GPT-5.2 Pro by OpenAI and Aristotle by Harmonic, operated by Kevin Barreto. The final result of the system is a formal proof written in Lean, which we translate to informal mathematics in the present writeup for wider accessibility. The proved result is as follows. We show a logarithmic-gap phenomenon regarding factorial divisibility: For any constants $0<C_1<C_2$ and $0 < \varepsilon < 1/2$ there exist infinitely many triples $(a,b,n)\in\mathbb N^3$ with $\varepsilon n \le a,b \le (1-\varepsilon)n$ such that $$ a!\,b!\mid n!\,(a+b-n)!\qquad\text{and}\qquad C_1\log n < a+b-n < C_2\log n. $$ The argument reduces this to a binomial divisibility $\binom{m+k}{k}\mid\binom{2m}{m}$ and studies it prime-by-prime. By Kummer's theorem, $ν_p\binom{2m}{m}$ translates into a carry count for doubling $m$ in base $p$. We then employ a counting argument to find, in each scale $[M,2M]$, an integer $m$ whose base-$p$ expansions simultaneously force many carries when doubling $m$, for every prime $p\le 2k$, while avoiding the rare event that one of $m+1,\dots,m+k$ is divisible by an unusually high power of $p$. These "carry-rich but spike-free" choices of $m$ force the needed $p$-adic inequalities and the divisibility. The overall strategy is similar to results regarding divisors of $\binom{2n}{n}$ studied earlier by Erdős and by Pomerance.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages. All comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a Schur--Horn type inequality for symmetric hyperbolic polynomials. As an immediate consequence, we resolve a conjecture of Nam Q. Le on Hadamard-type inequalities for hyperbolic polynomials. Our argument is based on the Schur--Horn theorem, the Birkhoff theorem, and Gårding's concavity theorem for hyperbolicity cones. Beyond the eigenvalue level, we develop a symmetrization principle on hyperbolicity cones: if a hyperbolic polynomial is invariant under a finite group action, then its value increases under the associated Reynolds operator (group averaging). Applied to the sign-flip symmetries of linear principal minor polynomials introduced by Blekherman et al., this yields a short proof of the hyperbolic Fischer--Hadamard inequalities for PSD-stable lpm polynomials.</p></details>

> **Comment:** To appear in Integers

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a number field and $\mathcal{O}_K$ be the ring of integers of $K$. In this article, we study the solutions of the generalized fruit Diophantine equation $ax^d-y^2-z^2 +xyz-c=0$ over $K$, where $d \geq 3$ is an integer and $a,c\in \mathcal{O}_K\setminus \{0\}$. Subsequently, we provide explicit values of square-free integers $t$ such that the equation $ax^d-y^2-z^2 +xyz-c=0$ has no solution $(x_0, y_0, z_0) \in \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{t})}^3$ with $2 | x_0$, and demonstrate that the set of all such square-free integers $t$ with $t \geq 2$ has density exactly $\frac{1}{6}$. As an application, we construct infinitely many elliptic curves $E$ defined over number fields $K$ having no integral point $(x_0,y_0) \in \mathcal{O}_K^2$ with $2|x_0$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Carl Pomerance, Andreas Weingartner &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 25 pages, 1 table

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A famous conjecture of Erd\H os and Straus is that for every integer $n\ge2$, $4/n$ can be represented as $1/x+1/y+1/z$, where $x,y,z$ are positive integers. This conjecture was generalized to $5/n$ by Sierpiński, and then Schinzel conjectured that for every integer $m\ge4$ there is a bound $n_m$ such that the fraction $m/n$ is the sum of 3 unit fractions for all integers $n\ge n_m$. Leveraging and generalizing work of Elsholtz and Tao, we show that if $n_m$ exists it must be at least $\exp(m^{1/3+o(1)})$; that is, there are numbers $n$ this large for which $m/n$ is not the sum of 3 unit fractions. We prove a weaker, but numerically explicit version of this theorem, showing that for $m\ge 6.52\times10^9$ there is a prime $p\in(m^2,2m^2)$ with $m/p$ not the sum of 3 unit fractions, and report on some extensive numerical calculations that support this assertion with the much smaller bound $m\ge20$. A result of Vaughan is that for each $m$, most $n$'s have $m/n$ representable; we make the dependence on $m$ in this result explicit. In addition, we prove a result generalizing the problem to the sum of $j$ unit fractions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Arshay Sheth &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbb Q$ be an elliptic curve and for each prime $p$, let $N_p$ denote the number of points of $E$ modulo $p$. The original version of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture asserts that $\prod \limits _{p \leq x} \frac{N_p}{p} \sim C (\log x) ^{\text{rank}(E(\mathbb Q))}$ as $x \to \infty$. Goldfeld (1982) showed that this conjecture implies both the Riemann Hypothesis for $L(E, s)$ and the modern formulation of the conjecture i.e. that $\text{ord}_{s=1} L(E, s)= \text{rank}(E(\mathbb Q))$. In this paper, we prove that if we let $r=\text{ord} _{s=1}L(E, s)$, then under the assumption of the Riemann Hypothesis for $L(E, s)$, we have that $\prod \limits _{p \leq x} \frac{N_p}{p} \sim C (\log x)^r$ for all $x$ outside a set of finite logarithmic measure. As corollaries, we recover not only Goldfeld's result, but we also prove a result in the direction of the converse. Our method of proof is based on establishing the asymptotic behaviour of partial Euler products of $L(E, s)$ in the right-half of the critical strip.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Updated version; minor typos corrected

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study Chebyshev's bias for the signs of Fourier coefficients of cuspidal newforms on $Γ_0(N)$. Our main result shows that the bias towards either sign is completely determined by the order of vanishing of the $L$-function $L(s, f)$ at the central point of the critical strip. We then give several examples of modular forms where we explicitly compute the order of vanishing of $L(s, f)$ at the central point and as a by-product, verify the super-positivity property, in the sense of Yun--Zhang (2017), for these examples.</p></details>

> **Comment:** To appear in Journal of Algebra

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a totally real number field and $\mathcal{O}_K$ be the ring of integers of $K$. In this article, we study the asymptotic solutions of the generalized Fermat equation $Ax^p+By^p+Cz^p=0$ over $K$ with prime exponent $p$, where $A,B,C \in \mathcal{O}_K \setminus \{0\}$ with $ABC$ is even. For certain class of fields $K$, we prove that the equation $Ax^p+By^p+Cz^p=0$ has no asymptotic solution $(a,b,c) \in \mathcal{O}_K^3$ with $2|abc$. Then, under some assumptions on $A,B,C$, we also prove that $Ax^p+By^p+Cz^p=0$ has no asymptotic solution in $K^3$. Finally, we give several purely local criteria of $K$ such that $Ax^p+By^p+Cz^p=0$ has no asymptotic solutions in $K^3$, and calculate the density of such fields $K$ when $K$ is a real quadratic field.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages, 2 figures; Corrected a few misprints

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we generalize the following problem, which is called the rational angle bisection problem, to the $n$-dimensional space $k^n$ over a subfield $k$ of $\mathbb R$: in the coordinate plane, for which rational numbers $a$ and $b$ are the slopes of the angle bisectors between two lines with slopes $a$ and $b$ rational? First, we give a few characterizations of when the angle bisectors between two lines with direction vectors in $k^n$ have direction vectors in $k^n.$ To find solutions to the problem in the case when $k = \mathbb Q,$ we also give a formula for the integral solutions of $x_1{}^2+\dots +x_n{}^2 = dx_{n+1}{}^2,$ which is a generalization of the negative Pell's equation $x^2-dy^2 = -1,$ where $d$ is a square-free positive integer. Second, by applying the above characterizations, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the incenter of a given $n$-simplex with $k$-rational vertices to be $k$-rational. In the coordinate plane, we prove that every triangle with $k$-rational vertices and incenter can be obtained by scaling a triangle with $k$-rational side lengths and area, which is a generalization of a Heronian triangle. We also state certain fundamental properties of a few centers of a given triangle with $k$-rational vertices.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 29 pages, many figures. v2: minor corrections

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras $\mathcal{A}$ associated with unpunctured surfaces $\tilde{\mathbf{S}}$ endowed with an orientation-preserving involution $σ$. We give a geometric realization of such cluster algebras by showing that cluster variables of $\mathcal{A}$ correspond to $σ$-orbits of arcs of $\tilde{\mathbf{S}}$, while clusters are given by admissible $σ$-invariant triangulations. We establish a ring homomorphism from $\mathcal{A}$ to a skew-symmetric cluster algebra of the same rank, which is combinatorially derived from $\mathcal{A}$. We use this result to provide a cluster expansion formula for any $σ$-orbit $[γ]$ in terms of perfect matchings of some labeled modified snake graphs constructed from the arcs of $[γ]$. Then, we associate a symmetric finite-dimensional algebra $A$ to any seed of $\mathcal{A}$, such that non-initial cluster variables bijectively correspond to orthogonal indecomposable $A$-modules. Finally, we exhibit a purely representation-theoretic map from the category of orthogonal $A$-modules to $\mathcal{A}$, providing a Caldero-Chapoton map in this setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the following Return Times Theorem along the sequence of prime times, the first extension of the Return Times Theorem to arithmetic sequences: For every probability space, $(Ω,ν)$, equipped with a measure-preserving transformation, $T \colon Ω\to Ω$, and every $f \in L^\infty(Ω)$, there exists a set of full probability, $Ω_f \subset Ω$ with $ν(Ω_f) =1$, so that for all $ω\in Ω_f$, for any other probability space $(X,μ)$, equipped with a measure-preserving transformation $S : X \to X$, for any $g \in L^{\infty}(X)$, \begin{align} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n \leq N} f(T^{p_n} ω) g(S^{p_n} \cdot) \end{align} converges $μ$-almost surely; above, $\{ 2=p_1 < p_2 < \dots \}$ are an enumeration of the primes. The Wiener-Wintner theorem along the primes is an immediate corollary. Our proof lives at the interface of classical Fourier analysis, combinatorial number theory, higher order Fourier analysis, and pointwise ergodic theory, with $U^3$ theory playing an important role; our $U^3$-estimates for \emph{Heath-Brown} models of the von Mangoldt function may be of independent interest.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish explicit unconditional results on the graphic properties of the prime gap sequence. Let $p_n$ denote the $n$-th prime number (with $p_0=1$) and $\mathrm{PD}_n = (p_\ell - p_{\ell-1})_{\ell=1}^n$ be the sequence of the first $n$ prime gaps. Building upon the recent work by Erdős \emph{et al}, which proved the graphic nature of $\mathrm{PD}_n$ for large $n$ unconditionally, and for all $n$ under RH, we provide the first explicit unconditional threshold such that: (1) For all $n \geq \exp\exp(30.5)$, $\mathrm{PD}_n$ is graphic. (2) For all $n \geq \exp\exp(34.5)$, every realization $G_n$ of $\mathrm{PD}_n$ satisfies that $(G_n, p_{n+1}-p_n)$ is DPG-graphic. Our proofs utilize a more refined criterion for when a sequence is graphic, and better estimates for the first moment of large prime gaps proven through an explicit zero-free region and explicit zero-density estimate for the Riemann zeta function.</p></details>

These give the first savings in the exceptional spectrum for the critical case of sequences as long as the level, and lead to improved bounds for various multilinear forms of Kloosterman sums. As an application, we show that the greatest prime factor of $n^2+1$ is infinitely often greater than $n^{1.3}$, improving Merikoski's previous threshold of $n^{1.279}$. We also announce applications to the exponents of distribution of primes and smooth numbers in arithmetic progressions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper develops from scratch a theory of Galois rings and orders over arbitrary fields. Our approach is different from others in the literature in that there is no non-modularity assumption. We prove, when the field is algebraically closed, the analogue of the Main Theorem of the representation theory of Galois orders by V. Futorny and S. Ovsienko. Then we develop a theory of infinite rank generalized Weyl algebras, which was never explicitly introduced in the literature before, and prove its basic properties. We expect their representation theory to be of interest for future works. Finally we show that under very mild assumptions, the invariants of generalized Weyl algebras under the action of non-exceptional irreducible complex reflection groups are a principal Galois orders, greatly generalizing, in an elementary fashion, results obtained previously for the Weyl algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2010, Sarnak initiated the study of the dynamics of the system determined by the square of the Möbius function (the characteristic function of the square-free integers). We deal with his program in the more general context of $\mathfrak{B}$-free integers in number fields, suggested 5 years later by Baake and Huck. This setting encompasses the classical square-free case and its generalizations. Given a number field $K$, let $\mathfrak{B}$ be a family of pairwise coprime ideals in its ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$, such that $\sum_{\mathfrak{b}\in\mathfrak{B}}1/|\mathcal{O}_K / \mathfrak{b}|<\infty$. We study the dynamical system determined by the set $\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}=\mathcal{O}_K\setminus \bigcup_{\mathfrak{b}\in\mathfrak{B}}\mathfrak{b}$ of $\mathfrak{B}$-free integers in $\mathcal{O}_K$. We show that the characteristic function $\mathbb{1}_{\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}}$ of $\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}$ is generic along the natural Følner sequence for a probability measure on $\{0,1\}^{\mathcal{O}_K}$, invariant under the multidimensional shift. The corresponding measure-theoretical dynamical system is proved to be isomorphic to an ergodic rotation on a compact Abelian group. In particular, it is of zero Kolmogorov entropy. Moreover, we provide a description of ``patterns'' appearing in $\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}$ and compute the topological entropy of the orbit closure of $\mathbb{1}_{\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}}$. Finally, we show that this topological dynamical system has a non-trivial topological joining with an ergodic rotation on a compact Abelian group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a refinement process for two-term Machin-like formulas: $a_0 \arctan{u_0} + a_1 \arctan{u_1} = \fracπ{4}$ (where $a_0 , a_1 \in \mathbb{Z}$, $u_0 , u_1 \in \mathbb{Q}_+^*$, $u_0 > u_1$) by exploiting the continued fraction expansion of the ratio $α:= \frac{\arctan{u_0}}{\arctan{u_1}}$. This construction yields a sequence of derived two-term Machin-like formulas: $a_{- n} \arctan{u_n} + a_{- n + 1} \arctan{u_{n + 1}} = \fracπ{4}$ ($n \in \mathbb{N}$) with positive rational arguments $u_n$ decreasing to zero and corresponding integer coefficients $a_{- n}$. We derive closed forms and estimates for $a_{-n}$ and $u_n$ in terms of the convergents of $α$ and prove that the associated rational sequence $(a_{- n} u_n + a_{- n + 1} u_{n + 1})_n$ converges to $π/4$ with geometric decay. The method is illustrated using Euler's two-term Machin-like formula : $\arctan(1/2) + \arctan(1/3) = π/4$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be an odd prime. For a compact Lie group $G$ and an elementary abelian $p$-group $A$ of $G$, one may define the Weyl group $W_A$ of $A$ in a similar fashion as defining the Weyl group of a maximal torus, such that $W_A$ acts on $H^*(BA;R)$ for any coefficient ring $R$, and the image of the restriction $H^*(BG;R)\to H^*(BA;R)$ lies in $H^*(BA;R)^{W_A}$, the sub-algebra of $H^*(BA:R)$ of $W_A$-invariant elements. In this paper, we consider the projective unitary group $PU(p^m)$ and one of its maximal elementary abelian $p$-subgroup $A_m$, of which the Weyl group is isomorphic to $Sp_{2m}(\mathbb{F}_p)$. Then the theory of $Sp_{2m}(\mathbb{F}_p)$-invariant polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_p$ may be applied to study the cohomology of $BPU(p^m)$, the classifying space of $PU(p^m)$. Following a theorem by Quillen, we deduce several theorems on $H^*(BPU(p^m);\mathbb{F}_p)$ modulo the nilradical from results on invariant polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A set $\mathcal S\subset \mathbb N$ is said to be a subset-sum-distinct or dissociated if all of its finite subsets have different sums. Alternately, an equivalent classification is if any equality of the form $$\sum_{s\in \mathcal S} \varepsilon_s \cdot s =0$$ where $\varepsilon_s \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ implies that all the $\varepsilon_s$'s are $0$. For a dissociated set $\mathcal S$, we prove that for $c_\ast = \frac 12 \log_2 \left(\frac π2\right)$ and any $c_\ast-1<C<c_\ast$, we have $$\mathcal S(n) \,:=\, \mathcal S\cap [1,n] \,\le\, \log_2 n +\frac 12 \log_2\log_2 n + C$$ for all $n\in \mathcal N_C$ with asymptotic density $\mathbf d\left(\mathcal N_C\right)=2-2^{c_\ast-C}$. Further, we consider the greedy algorithm for generating these sets and prove that this algorithm always eventually doubles.

The results have a three-fold nature: in the first part of the paper, we $p$-adically interpolate the adjoint Kudla lift, exploiting the previously constructed $Λ$-adic Kudla lift. In the second part, we construct higher weight cycles in Kuga-Sato varieties attached to Picard modular surfaces, and show modularity of the generating series of these cycles, thus obtaining a higher weight analogue of the Cogdell lift. Finally, we apply the formalism introduced by Loeffler to construct $p$-adic analytic cohomology classes of special cycles, whose generating series is proved to be a Hida family interpolating the Cogdell lifts in the weight and level variables.</p></details>

The key new phenomenon is the existence of many intermediate groups between the $\mathrm{SL}_2$ containing our unipotent and the ambient group, which introduces potential local and global obstruction to equidistribution.

We propose a study on the question of the existence of distortion maps for elliptic curves over finite fields. We revisit results from the literature and provide detailed proofs. We also propose new perspectives at times.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Adinkras are highly structured graphs developed to study 1-dimensional supersymmetry algebras. A cyclic ordering of the edge colors of an Adinkra, or rainbow, determines a Riemann surface and a height function on the vertices of the Adinkra determines a divisor on this surface. We study the induced map from height functions to divisors on the Jacobian of the Riemann surface. In the first nontrivial case, a 5-dimensional hypercube corresponding to a Jacobian given by a product of 5 elliptic curves each with $j$-invariant 2048, we develop and characterize a purely combinatorial algorithm to compute height function images. We show that when restricted to a single elliptic curve, every height function is a multiple of a specified generating divisor, and raising and lowering vertices corresponds to adding or subtracting this generator. We also give strict bounds on the coefficients of this generator that appear in the collection of all divisors of height functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In relation to Kostant's problem for simple highest weight modules over the general linear Lie algebra, we prove a persistence result for Kostant negative consecutive patterns. Inspired by it, we introduce the notion of a Kostant cuspidal permutation as a minimal Kostant negative consecutive pattern. It is shown that Kostant cuspidality is an invariant of a Kazhdan-Lusztig left cell. We describe four infinite families of Kostant cuspidal involutions, including a complete classification of Kostant cuspidal fully commutative involutions. In particular, we show that the number of new Kostant cuspidal elements can be arbitrarily large, when the rank grows. This provides some potential explanation why Kostant's problem is hard.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove universality for cokernels of random integral matrices with symmetries via an approach different from the classical surjection moment method introduced by Wood (arXiv:1402.5149). In the symmetric case, we reprove Hodges' universality theorem (arXiv:2311.07078), i.e. the version incorporating the canonical pairing from Wood's setting, and in the alternating case we reprove the local universality theorem of Nguyen-Wood (arXiv:2210.08526). A key advantage of our method is that it is quantitative: we obtain explicit error bounds, which are exponentially small in most regimes, thereby addressing Wood's question on effective convergence rates. Our argument is inspired by Maples' exposure-process and coupling viewpoint (arXiv:1301.1239) and uses a generalized form of Fourier-analytic estimates in the exponentially sharp style of Ferber-Jain-Sah-Sawhney (arXiv:2106.04049).</p></details>

> **Comment:** 9 pages, revised based on referee comments

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The well-known Van Lint--MacWilliams' conjecture states that if $q$ is an odd prime power, and $A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ such that $0,1 \in A$, $|A|=q$, and $a-b$ is a square for each $a,b \in A$, then $A$ must be the subfield $\mathbb{F}_q$. This conjecture was first proved by Blokhuis and is often phrased in terms of the maximum cliques in Paley graphs of square order. Previously, Asgarli and the author extended Blokhuis' theorem to a larger family of Cayley graphs. In this paper, we give a new simple proof of Blokhuis' theorem and its extensions. More generally, we show that if $S \subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}^*$ has small multiplicative doubling, and $A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ with $0,1 \in A$, $|A|=q$, such that $A-A \subseteq S \cup \{0\}$, then $A=\mathbb{F}_q$. This new result refines and extends several previous works; moreover, our new approach avoids using heavy machinery from number theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce integer sequences satisfying new congruence properties inspired by the Euler and Gauss congruences, which we call Euler-Gauss sequences. Noting that every Gauss sequence is an Euler-Gauss sequence, we compare them with certain generalisations of Gauss sequences and provide several counterexamples. Unlike the Gauss sequences, this extended class also contains sequences based on distinct prime factors. In particular, the sequences Smallest Prime Factor (SPF) and Greatest Prime Factor (GPF) sequences (suitably defined at 1), extensively studied by prominent mathematicians such as Erdos and Alladi, arise as examples of this class of Euler-Gauss sequences and not in the class of Gauss sequences. In the latter part of the paper, we obtain q-analogs of the defined Euler-Gauss sequences and establish characteristic properties that reveal their structure and fill gaps in the literature on q-Gauss sequences. In recent works, q-Gauss sequences have been shown to admit interesting combinatorial interpretations and to exhibit the Cyclic Sieving Phenomenon (CSP). Not only do our q-Euler-Gauss sequences satisfy the standard CSP with some restriction, but we also derive a new CSP condition for the SPF and GPF sequences, not hitherto known in the literature.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $x\ge y>0$ be integers. A positive integer is $y$-smooth if all its prime divisors are at most $y$. Let $Ψ(x,y)$ count the number of $y$-smooth integers up to $x$. We present several algorithms that will generate an integer $n\le x$ at random, with known prime factorization, such that $n$ is $y$-smooth. We begin by describing algorithms to compute $Ψ(x,y)$ exactly and to enumerate $y$-smooth integers up to $x$ in lexicographic order by prime divisor. Both of these are based on Buchstab's identity, and were likely known before. Then we present an algorithm that accepts as input a parameter $r$, $0\le r<1$, and returns the integer $n$ that is at position $\lfloor rΨ(x,y)\rfloor$ in the lexicographic ordering of all $y$-smooth integers up to $x$. Here position 0 is the first position. Thus, $n$ is generated uniformly so long as $r$ is chosen uniformly. This algorithm has a running time of $O(Ψ(x,y)\log\log y)$ arithmetic operations. We then explore the tradeoff between speed and rigor. By relaxing the uniformity of the output and allowing for multiple heuristics in our runtime analysis, we improve the running time to $$ O\left( \frac{ (\log x)^3 }{\log\log x} \right)$$ arithmetic operations. We conclude with a sample run by generating a $10000$-smooth integer $\le 10^{100}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a finite group whose order is divisible by the characteristic of a field $k$. If $B$ is a block of $kG$ with defect group $P$, we prove that the space of derivations on $kP$ which are restrictions of derivations on $kG$, modulo inner derivations, is isomorphic to a subspace of $\mathrm{HH}^1(B,B)$. Using this, we provide various group theoretic criteria for the non-vanishing of $\mathrm{HH}^1(B,B)$. In particular, we show $\mathrm{HH}^1(B,B)\neq 0$ for principal blocks having abelian defect group, for all blocks of the symmetric and alternating groups, for blocks of finite groups of Lie type in defining characteristic, and for blocks of general linear groups in any characteristic. Building on this, we show that if $k$ has prime characteristic $p>5$, and if $B$ is any block of $kG$ with Sylow defect group, then $\mathrm{HH}^1(B,B)\neq 0$. By the same method we also prove that if $k$ has prime characteristic $p>5$, then the first Hochschild cohomology group of any twisted group algebra is non-zero.</p></details>

When $ρ$ is generic and a good conjugate, the article "Conjectures and results on modular representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ for a $p$-adic field $K$", by Breuil-Herzig-Hu-Morra-Schraen, introduces the notion of compatibility with $ρ$ for an admissible representation of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. In loc. cit., the five authors also question whether one could recover a representation of $\mathcal{G}_{\mathbb{Q}_p}^{n-1}$, called $\overline{L}^{\boxtimes}(ρ)$ and constructed from $ρ$, from some $Π$ compatible with $ρ$ by using Zábrádi's functor $\mathbf{V}_Δ$. We give a range of results, for an arbitrary $Π$ verifying some "weak" compatibilities with $ρ$, about how badly $\mathbf{V}_Δ(Π)$ behaves. In particular, when $ρ$ is reducible and $n\geq 3$, no $Π$ compatible with $P_ρ$ can verify $\mathbf{V}_Δ(Π)\simeq \overline{L}^{\boxtimes}(ρ)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is an open problem whether $ \binom{2n}{n} $ is divisible by 4 or 9 for all $n>256$. In connection with this, we prove that for a fixed uneven $m$ the asymptotic density of $k$'s such that $ m \nmid \binom{2^{k+1}}{2^{k}} $ is 0. To do so we examine numbers of the form $α^{k}$ in base $p$, where $p$ is a prime and $(α, p)=1$. For every $n$ and $a$ we find an upper bound on the number of $k$'s less than $a$ such that $(α^{k})_p$ contains less than $n$ digits greater than $\frac{p}{2}$. This is done by showing that every sequence of the form $\langle σ_t, \dots, σ_1,σ_0 \rangle$, where $0\leq σ_i<p$ for $i\geq 1$ and $σ_0$ is in the residue class generated by $α$ modulo $p$, occurs at specific places in the representation $(α^k)_p$ as $k$ varies.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By the work of Hernandez-Leclerc, Leclerc-Plamondon, and Keller-Scherotzke, affine graded Nakajima quiver varieties associated with a Dynkin quiver $Q$ admit an algebraic description in terms of modules over the singular Nakajima category $\mathcal{S}$ and a stratification functor to the derived category of $Q$. In this paper, we extend this framework to Nakajima's $n$-fold affine graded tensor product varieties, which allow one to geometrically realize $n$-fold tensor products of standard modules over the quantum affine algebra. We introduce a category of filtrations with splitting of length $n$ of modules over a category and show that it is equivalent to the module category of a triangular matrix category. Applied to the singular Nakajima category, this yields a category $\mathcal{S}^{n\mathrm{-filt}}$ whose modules are parametrized by the points of the $n$-fold tensor product varieties. Generalizing the results of Keller-Scherotzke from $\mathcal{S}$ to $\mathcal{S}^{n\mathrm{-filt}}$, we prove that the stable category of finitely generated Gorenstein projective $\mathcal{S}^{n\mathrm{-filt}}$-modules is triangle equivalent to the derived category of the algebra of $n \times n$ upper triangular matrices over the path algebra of $Q$, and we obtain a corresponding stratification functor.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The question of when the derived category of a ring satisfies Brown--Adams representability is revisited via studying the transfer of pure homological dimension along definable functors: it is shown that, for any ring, the pure global dimension of the derived category is at least the pure global dimension of the ring; expanding results of Beligiannis and Keller-Christensen-Neeman. This result is obtained by constructing `change of category' isomorphisms of PExt groups across definable functors. The same isomorphisms illustrate circumstances when one can transfer the property of Brown--Adams representability. We demonstrate how these methods can be used to test whether certain derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves are a Brown category. We also make an investigation into the structure of derived categories of von Neumann regular rings, which are shown in many cases to control Brown--Adams representability; this includes a new proof of the telescope conjecture, and a new and short proof that a coherent ring satisfies Freyd's (strong) generating hypothesis if and only if it is von Neumann regular.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be the algebra $\mathbb{C}[X_1^{\pm 1},X_2^{\pm 1}]$ and $Q(A)$ its quotient field. In this short article, we exhibit the correct normalization for the toric period on the parabolically induced unramified family over $Q(A)$, so that it behaves optimally under restriction to the parabolically induced unramified family over $A$. This answers a question raised by D. Prasad, and points towards potential generalizations to a broader unramified Gan-Gross-Prasad setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The shape of a number field $K$ of degree $n$ is defined as the equivalence class of the lattice of integers with respect to linear operations that are composites of rotations, reflections, and positive scalar dilations. The shape is a point in the space of shapes $\mathscr{S}_{n-1}$, which is the double quotient $\mathrm{GL}_{n-1}(\mathbb{Z}) \backslash \mathrm{GL}_{n-1}(\mathbb{R}) / \mathrm{GO}_{n-1}(\mathbb{R})$. We investigate the distribution of shapes of pure sextic number fields $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[6]{m})$, ordered by absolute discriminant. Such fields are partitioned into $20$ distinct Types determined by local conditions at $2$ and $3$, and an explicit integral basis is given in each case. For each Type, the shape of $K$ admits an explicit description in terms of shape parameters. Fixing the sign of $m$ and a Type, we prove that the corresponding shapes are equidistributed along a translated torus orbit in the space of shapes. The limiting distribution is given by an explicit measure expressed as the product of a continuous measure and a discrete measure.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A well-known consequence of Schur's theorem is that for $r\in \mathbb{N}$, if $n$ is sufficiently large, then any $r$-colouring of $[n]$ results in monochromatic $a,b,c\in [n]$ such that $ab=c$. In this paper we are interested in the threshold at which the binomial random set $[n]_p$ almost surely inherits this Ramsey-type property. In particular for $r=2$ colours, we show that this threshold lies between $n^{-1/9-o(1)}$ and $n^{-1/11}$. Whilst analogous questions for solutions to (sets of) linear equations are now well understood, our work suggests that both the behaviour of the thresholds and the proof methods needed to determine them differ substantially in the non-linear setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a theory of $p$-adic Néron functions on abelian varieties, depending on various auxiliary choices, and show that the global $p$-adic height functions constructed by Mazur and Tate can be decomposed into a sum of $p$-adic Néron functions if the same auxiliary choices are made. We also consider a decomposition of the $p$-adic height constructed by Coleman and Gross for good reduction, and extended to arbitrary reduction by Colmez and Besser, into a sum of certain local height functions for Jacobians of odd degree genus~$2$ curves. We show that this local height function is equal to the $p$-adic Néron function with the same auxiliary choices, regardless of the reduction type of the curve. This extends work of Balakrishnan and Besser for elliptic curves. When the curve has semistable reduction and the reduction of the Jacobian is ordinary, we also describe the $p$-adic Néron function that arises from the canonical Mazur--Tate splitting explicitly in terms of a generalisation of the $p$-adic sigma function constructed by Blakestad.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It was conjectured by Flynn that there exists a constant $κ$ such that, for any integer $g \ge 2$, any $m \le κg$, there exists a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g$ over $\mathbb Q$ with a rational $m$-torsion point on its Jacobian. Leprévost proved this conjecture with $κ=3$. In this work we prove that given an integer $N$ in the interval $[3g,4g+1]$, $g\ge 3$, satisfying certain partition conditions, there exist parametric families of hyperelliptic Jacobian varieties with a rational torsion point of order $N$. In particular, we establish the existence of such varieties for $N=4g+1$ when $g$ is odd and for $N=4g-1$ when $g$ is even. A few explicit applications of this result produce the first known infinite examples of torsion $13$ when $g=3$, torsion $15$ when $g=4$, and torsion $17,18,21$ when $g=5$. In fact, we show that infinitely many of the latter abelian varieties are absolutely simple.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a new infinite-dimensional Lie superalgebra $\mathcal{S}$ called the super extended Ovsienko--Roger algebra. This algebra is obtained by determining the annihilation superalgebra of the Lie conformal superalgebra $S=S_{\bar0}\oplus S_{\bar{1}}$ with $S_{\bar{0}}=\mathbb{C}[\partial]L\oplus\mathbb{C}[\partial]W$, $S_{\bar{1}}=\mathbb{C}[\partial]G$ and non-trivial $λ$-brackets $[L_λL]=(\partial+2λ)L$, $[L_λG]=(\partial+λ)G$, $[L_λW]=[G_λG]=\partial W$. Then we construct a class of simple restricted $\mathcal{S}$-modules, which are induced from simple modules of some finite dimensional solvable Lie superalgebras under certain conditions. Moreover, we obtain the classification of simple generalized Verma modules over $\mathcal{S}$ and we show that the Verma module of $\mathcal{S}$ is always reducible.</p></details>

We discovered that their algebras $A(\mathfrak{g})$ have a natural interpretation in terms of affine vertex algebras, and their ad-hoc formulas take an extremely simple form in this new interpretation. It is our hope that this point of view will lead to a better understanding of this interesting class of algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Stone duality establishes a contravariant equivalence between the category of Boolean algebras and the category of compact, Hausdorff, totally disconnected topological spaces (Stone spaces). These spaces are precisely the profinite spaces and form the natural environment for arithmetic objects such as the $p$-adic integers, absolute Galois groups, and profinite completions. In this article we give a rigorous and self-contained development of the construction of the Stone space associated to a Boolean algebra, prove Stone's representation theorem, and describe profinite spaces as inverse limits of finite systems. From there we introduce the Stone--Čech compactification via its universal property and discuss central arithmetic examples (such as $β\mathbb{N}$ and profinite completions), emphasizing their structural role in arithmetic geometry and in the framework of Condensed Mathematics of Clausen--Scholze. The text is aimed at advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students, as well as readers interested in the interface between topology, number theory, and new categorical formulations of topology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A band is a semigroup in which each element is idempotent. In recent years, there has been a lot of activity on the representation theory of the subclass of left regular bands due to connections to Markov chains associated to hyperplane arrangements, oriented matroids, matroids and CAT(0) cube complexes. We prove here that the integral semigroup algebra of a band is isomorphic to the integral path algebra of a quiver modulo an admissible ideal. This leads to a uniform bound quiver presentation for band algebras over all fields. Also, we answer a question of Margolis, Saliola and Steinberg by proving that the integral semigroup algebra of a CW left regular band is isomorphic to the quotient of the integral path algebra of the Hasse diagram of its support semilattice modulo the ideal generated by the sum of all paths of length two. This includes, for example, hyperplane face semigroup algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this follow-up paper, we again inspect a surprising relationship between the set of fixed points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ or $\in \mathbb{Z}_{p}$ or $\in \mathbb{F}_{p}[t]$ and the coefficient $c$, where $K$ is any number field of degree $n > 1$, $p>2$ is any prime, $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ (resp., $\mathbb{F}_{p}[t]$) is the ring of all $p$-adic integers (resp., the ring of all polynomials over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p}$) and $d>2$ is an integer. As before, we again wish to study counting problems which are inspired by advances in arithmetic statistics, and also by Narkiewicz on totally complex $K$-periodic points along with Adam-Fares on $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$-periodic points in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any prime $p\geq 3$ and for any $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$, the average number of distinct fixed points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ (modulo $p\mathbb{Z}_{p}$) is bounded or zero or unbounded as $c\to \infty$ . Motivated further by $\mathbb{F}_{p}(t)$-periodic point-counting result of Benedetto in arithmetic dynamics, we then also find that the average number of fixed points in $\mathbb{F}_{p}[t]$-setting behaves in the same way as in $\mathcal{O}_{K}$-setting. Finally, we then apply here counting and statistical results from arithmetic statistics, and as a result obtain counting and statistical results on irreducible monic ($p$-adic) integer polynomials, number fields and subfields of global function fields arising naturally in our polynomial discrete dynamical settings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider certain families of integers $n$ determined by some congruence condition, such that the global root number of the elliptic curve $E_{-432n^2}: Y^2=X^3-432n^2$ is $1$ for every $n$, however a given $n$ may or may not be a sum of two rational cubes. We give explicit criteria in terms of the $2$-parts and $3$-parts of the ideal class groups of certain cubic number fields to determine whether such an $n$ is a cube sum. In particular, we study integers $n$ divisible by $3$ such that the global root number of $E_{-432n^2}$ is $1$. For example, for a prime $\ell \equiv 7 \pmod{9}$, we show that for $3\ell$ to be a sum of two rational cubes, it is necessary that the ideal class group of $\Q(\sqrt[3]{12\ell})$ contains $\frac{\Z}{6\Z}\oplus \frac{\Z}{3\Z}$ as a subgroup. Moreover, for a positive proportion of primes $\ell \equiv 7 \pmod{9}$, $3\ell$ can not be a sum of two rational cubes. A key ingredient in the proof is to explore the relation between the $2$-Selmer group and the $3$-isogeny Selmer group of $E_{-432n^2}$ with the ideal class groups of appropriate cubic number fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We analyze the non-semisimple category of line operators in Chern-Simons gauge theories based off the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$. Our proposal is that the category of line operators $\mathcal{C}$ can be identified with the derived category of modules for a boundary vertex operator algebra $\mathcal{V}$ realized as a certain infinite-order simple current extension of the affine current algebra $V(\mathfrak{gl}(1|1))$ by boundary monopole operators. By translating this simple current extension of $V(\mathfrak{gl}(1|1))$ to the unrolled, restricted quantum group $\overline{U}^E(\fgl(1|1))$, we show that our category of line operators admits a second description in terms of a quasi-quantum group $\mathcal{A}$ realized by uprolling. We also compare our results across an expected physical duality with the cyclic orbifold of a free, $B$-twisted hypermultiplet and find a slight discrepancy at the level of braiding and associator. We end with a detailed analysis of coupling to background flat $GL(1, \C)$ connections and the resulting category of non-genuine line operators.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the Kazhdan-Lusztig correspondence for a class of vertex operator superalgebras which, via the work of Costello-Gaiotto, arise as boundary VOAs of topological B twist of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ abelian gauge theories.

We build on the work of Creutzig-Lentner-Rupert to this large class of VOAs and extend it since in our case the categories don't have projective objectives and objects can have arbitrary Jordan Hölder length. Our correspondence significantly improves the understanding of the braided tensor category of line defects associated to this class of TQFT, by realizing line defects as modules of a Hopf algebra. In the process, we prove a case of the conjecture of Semikhatov-Tipunin, relating logarithmic CFTs to Nichols algebras of screening operators.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a smooth affine algebraic group $G$, one can attach various D-module categories to it that admit convolution monoidal structure. We consider the derived category of D-modules on $G$, the stack $G/G_{ad}$ and the category of Harish-Chandra bimodules. Combining the work of Beilinson-Drinfeld on D-modules and Hecke patterns with the recent work of the author with Dimofte and Py, we show that each of the above categories (more precisely the equivariant version) is monoidal equivalent to a localization of the DG category of modules of a graded Hopf algebra. As a consequence, we give an explicit braided monoidal structure to the derived category of D-modules on $G/G_{ad}$, which when restricted to the heart, recovers the braiding of Bezrukavnikov-Finkelberg-Ostrik.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we study the Hochschild-Mitchell Cohomology of triangular matrix categories. Given a triangular matrix category $Λ=\left[ \begin{smallmatrix} \mathcal{T} & 0 \\ M & \mathcal{U} \end{smallmatrix}\right]$, we investigate the relationship of the Hochschild-Mitchell cohomologies $H^{i}(Λ)$ and $H^{i}(\mathcal{U})$ of $Λ$ and $\mathcal{U}$ respectively; and we show that they can be connected by a long exact sequence. This result extend the well-known result of Michelana-Platzeck given in [S. Michelena, M. I. Platzeck. {\it{Hochschild cohomology of triangular matrix algebras}}. J. Algebra 233, (2000) 502-525].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We formulate a quantum phase space for rotational and nuclear-spin states of rigid molecules. For each nuclear spin isomer, we re-derive the isomer's admissible angular momentum states from molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, introduce its angular position states using quantization theory, and develop a generalized Fourier transform converting between the two. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We discuss two general features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, we quantify when and how an isomer's state space is completely rotation-spin entangled, meaning that it does not admit any separable states. Second, we identify isomers whose position states house an internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline how the fiber can be used as a quantum error-correcting code and discuss scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the specializations $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}^ε$ at roots of unity $ε$ of odd order of the graph algebras, associated to a simply-connected complex semi-simple algebraic group $G$ and a compact oriented surface $Σ_{g,n}^{\circ}$ with genus $g$, $n$ punctures, and one boundary component. We prove that the central localizations of $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}^ε$ and of its subalgebra $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}^{u_ε}$ of invariant elements under the coadjoint action of a small quantum group, are central simple algebras of PI degrees that we compute. Also, we describe their centers, and show they are integrally closed rings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A Fuchsian group $Γ$ has a modular embedding if its adjoint trace field is a totally real number field and every unbounded Galois conjugate $Γ^σ$ comes equipped with a holomorphic (or conjugate holomorphic) map ${φ^σ: \mathbb{B}^1 \to \mathbb{B}^1}$ intertwining the actions of $Γ$ and $Γ^σ$ on the Poincaré disk $\mathbb{B}^1$. This paper provides the first cocompact nonarithmetic Fuchsian groups with a modular embedding that are not commensurable with a triangle group. The main result, proved using period domains, is that any immersed totally geodesic complex curve on a complex hyperbolic $2$-orbifold has a modular embedding. Another consequence is arithmeticity of totally geodesic curves on finite-volume complex hyperbolic surfaces that are commensurable with quotients of $\mathbb{B}^1$ by the group generated by reflections in quadrilaterals satisfying certain angle conditions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an asymptotic formula for the number of integral points of bounded log anticanonical height on a singular quartic del Pezzo surface over arbitrary number fields, with respect to the largest admissible boundary divisor. The resulting Clemens complex is more complicated than usual, and leads to particularly interesting effective cone constants, associated with exponentially many polytopes whose volumes appear in the expected formula. Like a jigsaw puzzle, these polytopes fit together to one large polytope. The volume of this polytope appears in the asymptotic formula that we obtain using the universal torsor method via o-minimal structures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Following the work of Mestre, we use Weil's explicit formulas to compute explicit lower bounds on the conductors of elliptic curves and abelian varieties over number fields. Moreover, we obtain bounds for the conductor of elliptic curves and abelian varieties over $\mathbb{Q}$ with specified bad reduction and over number fields. As an application, for specific fields, we prove the non-existence of abelian varieties with everywhere good reduction.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove dynamical local limits for the singular numbers of $p$-adic random matrix products at both the bulk and edge. The limit object which we construct, the reflecting Poisson sea, may thus be viewed as a $p$-adic analogue of line ensembles appearing in classical random matrix theory. However, in contrast to those it is a discrete space Poisson-type particle system with only local reflection interactions and no obvious determinantal structure. The limits hold for any $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)$-invariant matrix distributions under weak universality hypotheses, with no spatial rescaling.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We relate the combinatorics of Hall-Littlewood polynomials to that of abelian $p$-groups with alternating or Hermitian perfect pairings. Our main result is an analogue of the classical relationship between the Hall algebra of abelian $p$-groups (without pairings) and Hall-Littlewood polynomials. Specifically, we define a module over the classical Hall algebra with basis indexed by groups with pairings, and explicitly relate its structure constants to Hall-Littlewood polynomials at different values of the parameter $t$. We also show certain expectation formulas with respect to Cohen-Lenstra type measures on groups with pairings. In the alternating case this gives a new and simpler proof of previous results of Delaunay-Jouhet.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Our primary concern is the computational complexity of algorithms that find all Carmichael numbers less than some specified bound $B$. We have three related results. First, we show CARMICHAELS is in $\textbf{P}$, where only the run-time is conditioned on the ERH. Second, we state a heuristically optimal tabulation algorithm, which is the first asymptotic improvement to tabulation algorithms in the $50$ years since Swift first described the prime-by-prime approach. Third, we implemented a related algorithm that tabulated $100$ times further while only doing about $5$ times the work of the prior tabulation. We found $308,279,939$ Carmichael numbers less than $10^{24}$ and we provide some statistics on these numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We survey three settings in which dimensions of intersection cohomology groups of algebraic varieties provide deep combinatorial and representation-theoretic information, and computations of the groups themselves have been made using combinatorial sheaves on finite posets. These settings are (1) intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and their realizations via moment graph sheaves and Soergel bimodules; (2) intersection cohomology of toric varieties, the associated g-polynomials of convex polytopes, and their realization via the theory of intersection cohomology of fans; and (3) intersection cohomology of arrangement Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of matroids, and their realization via intersection cohomology of matroids. In all three settings these constructions are valid in more general situations where the variety does not exist, leading to "intersection cohomology without spaces." We give parallel presentations of these three stories, highlighting applications to KLS-polynomials.</p></details>
