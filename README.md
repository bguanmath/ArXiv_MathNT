### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19669v1'>2512.19669</a>\]&nbsp; **Pivotal Module Categories, Factorization Homology and Modular Invariant Modified Traces**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jorge Becerra, Lukas Woike &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The algebraic notion of a pivotal module category was developed by Schaumann and Shimizu and is central to the description of boundary conditions in conformal field theory according to a proposal by Fuchs and Schweigert. In this paper, we present a large class of examples of pivotal module categories of topological origin: For a unimodular finite ribbon category $\mathcal{A}$, we prove that the factorization homology $\int_Σ\mathcal{A}$ of a compact oriented surface $Σ$ with $n$ marked boundary intervals, at least one per connected component, comes with the structure of a pivotal module category over $\mathcal{A}^{\boxtimes n}$. This endows the internal skein algebras of Ben-Zvi-Brochier-Jordan, in particular the elliptic double, with a symmetric Frobenius structure. As application, we obtain, for each choice of $\mathcal{A}$, a family of full open conformal field theories, each of which comes with correlation functions for all surfaces with marked boundary intervals that are explicitly computable using factorization homology. As a further application, we explain how modified traces can be 'integrated' over surfaces: We show that the modified trace for $\mathcal{A}$ extends in a canonical way to the factorization homology of $Σ$. The resulting traces have the remarkable property of being modular invariant, i.e. fixed by the mapping class group action.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The distribution of primes raising the level of even Galois representations of tetrahedral type is studied. Data are presented on primes $v\leq 10^8$ raising the level of $3$-adic even representations of various conductors. Based on the data, a conjecture is formulated concerning the distribution of certain lines in the plane. By an application of Wiles' formula, the conjecture is shown to imply that the density of primes raising the level of a $p$-adic even representation is $$\frac{p-1}{p},$$ in agreement with the density of $2/3$ for $p=3$ observed in the data.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a general lower bound on the rank of matrices of the form $ρ(h) - I$ with $ρ: G \rightarrow GL({\mathbb F}^n)$ an irreducible representation of a finite group $G$. The main tool in the proof is a (strengthening) of a reduction due to Efremenko from low rank matrices spanned by a few images of $ρ$ to Locally Decodable Codes (LDCs), which are a special kind of error correcting codes. We then apply the known results on 2-query LDCs to derive our rank bound.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Eric M. Rains &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The {\em Prym} of a cyclic covering of smooth projective curves is the ``new'' part of the Jacobian: the quotient of the Jacobian of the covering curve by the Jacobians of the intermediate covers. Given a family of such coverings, the fundamental group of the base of the family acts on the Tate modules of the Pryms, and the image of this representation is a key ingredient in answering arithmetic statistics questions about the distribution of the group structure of the $L$-torsion of a random Prym in the family. (Over ${\mathbb{F}}_q$, the action of Frobenius is roughly uniformly distributed over the {\em arithmetic} monodromy, a coset of the image of the fundamental group of the base change to $\bar{\mathbb{F}}_q$ (the {\em geometric} monodromy).) In the present note, we show for a number of natural families that (with limited exceptions) the geometric monodromy is sandwiched between a certain unitary group and its derived subgroup. In particular, this holds for the one-parameter families obtained by starting with any fixed cover and varying one (tame) ramification point. As an application, we deduce analogous largeness results for the monodromy of the Selmer groups of elliptic surfaces with $j=0$ or $j=1728$, by relating them to cyclic covers of degree 6 or 4 respectively, implying that their Selmer groups do not satisfy the standard heuristics. For instance, for eliptic surfaces with $j=0$ of sufficiently large height over ${\mathbb{P}}^1_{\mathbb{F}_q}$, the average size of the $l$-Selmer group is $l+3+o_q(1)$ when $l$ (fixed) and $q$ (large) are both 1 mod 3, compared to $l+1+o_q(1)$ for general elliptic surfaces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by Erdős' ternary conjecture and by recent work of Cui--Ma--Jiang [``Geometric progressions meet Cantor sets'', \textit{Chaos Solitons Fractals} \textbf{163} (2022), 112567.] on intersections between geometric progressions and Cantor-like sets in standard bases, we study the corresponding problem in the Zeckendorf numeration system. We prove that, for any fixed finite set of forbidden binary patterns, any integers $u\ge 1$, $q\ge 2$, and any window size $M$, the set of exponents $n$ for which the Zeckendorf expansion of $u q^n$ avoids the forbidden patterns within its $M$ least significant digits is either finite or ultimately periodic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that a large class of non-abelian monoidal categories can be realized as subcategories of tilting objects in abelian monoidal categories with a highest weight structure. The construction relies on a monoidal enhancement of Brundan-Stroppel's semi-infinite Ringel duality and applies to many of Sam-Snowden's triangular categories and Knop's tensor envelopes of regular categories. We also explain how monoidal Ringel duality gives rise to monoidal structures on categories of representations of affine Lie algebras at positive levels.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine the Picard number and the Ulrich complexity of general bidouble covers of the projective plane, providing the first systematic study of Ulrich bundles on non-cyclic abelian covers. For a bidouble plane branched along three smooth curves of degrees $n_1,n_2,n_3$, we show that $ρ(S)=1$ unless $(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ belongs to an explicit list, thereby extending Buium's classical results on double planes to the non-cyclic case. As an application, we determine the range of branch degrees for which Ulrich line bundles could exist, and we show that every even bidouble plane carries a special rank-two Ulrich bundle. Our method combines the invariant-theoretic decomposition of $H^2(S,\mathbb{Q})$ under the Galois group with cohomological criteria for Ulrich bundles.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 19 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Since the time of Minkowski a basic problem in number theory has been to find lower bounds for the absolute value $Δ(K)$ of the discriminant of a number field $K$ in terms of the degree $n(K)$ of $K$. In this paper we study another measure of the size of $K$ given by the covering radius $μ(K)$ of the ring of integers $O_K$ of $K$. Here $μ(K)$ is the $L^2$ radius $||V_2(K)||_2$ of the $L^2$ Voronoi cell $V_2(K)$ of $O_K$, where $V_2(K)$ is the set of points in $\mathbb{R} \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}} K$ that are at least as close to the origin as they are to any non-zero element of $O_K$. To put a limit on what lower bounds one can prove for $μ(K)$ in terms of $n(K)$, we study infinite families of $K$ of increasing degree for which $μ(K)$ can be bounded above by an explicit power of $n(K)$. We also study analogous questions when the $L^2$ norm is replaced by the $L^\infty$ norm.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19508v1'>2512.19508</a>\]&nbsp; **New universal vertex algebras as glueings of the basic ones**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Thomas Creutzig, Vladimir Kovalchuk, Andrew R. Linshaw &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 60 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There are three universal $2$-parameter vertex algebras $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$, $\mathcal{W}^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$, and $\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ which are freely generated of types $\mathcal{W}(2,3,4,\dots)$, $\mathcal{W}(2,4,6,\dots)$, and $\mathcal{W}(1^3, 2, 3^3, 4,\dots)$, respectively. They serve as classifying objects for vertex algebras with these generating types satisfying mild hypotheses. Their $1$-parameter quotients are expected to be the building blocks of all $\mathcal{W}$-algebras of classical Lie types. Furthermore, such $\mathcal{W}$-algebras are expected to be organized into families that are governed by new universal $2$-parameter vertex algebras, which are themselves glueings of copies of $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$ in type $A$ (together with a Heisenberg algebra), and copies of $\mathcal{W}^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$ and $\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ in types $B$, $C$, and $D$. We denote these universal objects by $\mathcal{W}^{X,S,M}_{\infty}$, where $X$ denotes the Lie type (either $A$, $C$, or $BD$ since types $B$ and $D$ can be treated uniformly), and $S$, $M$ are sets of positive integers that determine certain families of partitions. More precisely, for a partition $P = (n_0^{m_0}, n_1^{m_1},\dots, n_{t}^{m_t})$ of $N = \sum_{i=0}^t n_i m_i$ consisting of $m_i$ parts of size $n_i$, where $n_0> n_1 > \cdots > n_t \geq 2$, $M = \{m_0,\dots, m_t\}$ is the set of multiplicities, and $S = \{d_1,\dots, d_t\}$ is the set of height differences $d_{i+1} = n_i - n_{i+1}$. After introducing this general conjectural picture, we will construct the first nontrivial example $\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{so}_2}_{\infty}:=\mathcal{W}^{BD, \emptyset, \{2\}}_{\infty}$, which is a glueing of two copies of $\mathcal{W}^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Amal Vayalinkal &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 56 pages, extended the introduction in the new version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We analyze finite orbits of the natural braid group action on the character variety of the $n$ times punctured sphere. Building on recent results relating middle convolution and finite complex reflection groups, our work implements Katz's middle convolution to explicitly classify finite orbits in the $SL_2(\C)$-character variety of the punctured sphere. We provide theoretical results on the existence of finite orbits arising from the imprimitive finite complex reflection groups and formulas for constructing such examples when they exist. In the primitive finite complex reflection groups, we perform an exhaustive search and provide computational results. Our contributions also include Magma computer code for middle convolution and for computing the orbit under this action when it is known to be finite.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 63 pages. Accepted for publication in Compositio Mathematica

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an arithmetic refinement of the Yau-Zaslow formula by replacing the classical Euler characteristic in Beauville's argument by a "motivic Euler characteristic", related to the work of Levine. Our result implies similar formulas for other related invariants, including a generalisation of a formula of Kharlamov and Rasdeaconu on counting real rational curves on real K3 surfaces, and Saito's determinant of cohomology.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Fundamenta Informaticae final journal version; previous conference version appeared in RAMiCS 2023

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we consider relational structures arising from Comer's finite field construction, where the cosets need not be sum free. These Comer schemes generalize the notion of a Ramsey scheme and may be of independent interest. As an application, we give the first finite representation of $34_{65}$. This leaves $33_{65}$ as the only remaining relation algebra in the family $N_{65}$ with a flexible atom that is not known to be finitely representable. Motivated by this, we complement our upper bounds with some lower bounds. Using a SAT solver, we show that $33_{65}$ is not finitely representable on fewer than $24$ points, and that $33_{65}$ does not admit a cyclic group representation on fewer than $120$ points. We also employ a SAT solver to show that $34_{65}$ is not representable on fewer than $24$ points.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 47 pages; v2 aligns with published version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime. We prove bounds on short Dirichlet character sums evaluated at a class of homogeneous polynomials in arbitrary dimensions. In every dimension, this bound is nontrivial for sums over boxes with side lengths as short as $p^{1/4 + κ}$ for any $κ>0$. Our methods capitalize on the relationship between characters mod $p$ and characters over finite field extensions as well as bounds on the multiplicative energy of sets in products of finite fields.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages, comments very welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a perfect ring of characteristic $p>0$, and let $R$ be an animated $k$-algebra. This note aims to show that the Nygaard filtered prismatization $R^{\mathrm{Nyg}}$ of $R$ is naturally isomorphic, as a stack over $k^{\mathrm{Nyg}}$, to the relative spectrum over $k^{\mathrm{Nyg}}$ of the Rees algebra of the Nygaard filtered prismatic cohomology of $R$ relative to $k$. In doing so, we axiomatise the functorial affineness property displayed by the relative Nygaard filtered prismatization, and dub it de Rham affineness after the fundamental example of the functor sending an animated ring to its relative de Rham stack. While we treat this concept as an organising tool for the author's forthcoming work on the syntomification of Frobenius liftable schemes, we are able to frame some questions based on a structural theorem of independent interest: a functor to stacks which is de Rham affine often arises via ring stacks through transmutation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using the Nakayama duality induced by a Nakayama functor, we provide a novel and concise account of the existence of Auslander-Reiten dualities and almost split sequences in abelian categories with enough projective objects or enough injective objects. As an example, we establish the existence of almost split sequences ending with finitely presented modules and those starting with finitely copresented modules in the category of all modules over a small endo-local Hom-reflexive category. Specializing to algebras given by (not necessarily finite) quivers with relations, we further investigate when the categories of finitely presented modules, finitely copresented modules and finite dimensional modules have almost split sequences on either or both sides.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 47 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A problem raised by Cuadra and Simson in 2007 asks whether any locally finitely presented Grothendieck category with enough flat objects also has enough projectives. In this paper, we start from a key observation: a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category has enough flat objects if, and only if, it has exact products. This enables several equivalent reformulations of the problem, allowing us to identify a counterexample (thus providing a negative solution to the problem), while also connecting it to a classical ring-theoretical question posed by Miller in 1975, and even to the Telescope Conjecture for compactly generated triangulated categories. Moreover, we describe several classes of Grothendieck categories where the problem can be answered affirmatively. For example, we show that a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category whose category of finitely presented objects is Krull--Schmidt has enough flats if, and only if, it is generated by a family of finitely generated projectives.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define several versions of a class of varieties $X_{\mathfrak{g}}$ attached to a complex reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, generalizing the Hilbert scheme of points on the plane. These include trigonometric and elliptic versions attached to the corresponding groups. We also define the corresponding isospectral varieties $Y_{\mathfrak{g}}$. We prove a Gordon-Stafford localization theorem for $X_{\mathfrak{g}}$ and the corresponding equal-parameter rational Cherednik algebras, relate these varieties to the affine Springer fiber-sheaf correspondence of arXiv:2204.00303, and discuss examples. We conjecture that the torus-fixed points of our varieties are in bijection with two-sided cells in the finite Weyl group and prove this in types $ABC$. We relate these results to known results about Calogero-Moser spaces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the shrinking target and recurrence set associated to non-autonomous measure-preserving systems on compact metric spaces, establishing zero-one criteria in the spirit of classical Borel-Cantelli results. Our first main theorem gives a quantitative shrinking target result for non-autonomous systems under a uniform mixing condition, providing asymptotics with an optimal error term. This general result is applicable to certain families of inner functions, yielding concrete applications such as patterns of zeros in the multibase expansion. Turning to recurrence, we establish new zero-measure laws for non-autonomous systems. In the autonomous case, we prove a zero-one criterion for recurrence sets of centred, one-component inner functions via Markov partitions and distortion estimates. Together, these results provide a unified framework for shrinking target and recurrence problems in both autonomous and non-autonomous dynamics.</p></details>

Moved results in Section 6 specific to L:=Abs(\prod_U Q_p) with tor(L^\times)={-1,1} to the end of Section 5 (constructing "APRC environment"). Rewrote the proof of Proposition 6.3 detailing eta(b)^c=-1 conclusion. Anti-cyclotomic ultrafilter U now extant via Dirichlet's theorem (Cebotarev not required)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An ideal setting to exhibit infinite sets of primes $p$ relative to which an integer is a primitive root $\pmod p$ is provided by the ultraproduct ring $\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}=\prod_{\mathfrak{U}} \mathbb{Z}_p$ with respect to a nonprincipal ultrafilter $\mathfrak{U}$ on $\wp(\mathbb{P})$, extant via the ultrafilter theorem, such that an infinite Galois subextension $\mathbb{L}$ of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}$ satisfying $\mathrm{tor}(\mathbb{L}^\times)=\{\pm\tilde 1\}$ is realised as the relative algebraic closure $\mathrm{\Abs}(\widetilde{\mathbb{Q}})=\prod_{\mathfrak{U}} \mathbb{Q}_p)$ of the prime field of $\widetilde{\mathbb{Q}}$. Results include positive resolutions of the conjectured infinitude of primes $p$ for which \begin{itemise} \item $\frac{p-1}{2}$ is prime and \item a non-perfect-square $-1\neq m\in\mathbb{Z}$ is a primitive root $\pmod p$, \end{itemise} establishing as manifest the efficacy of ultraproduct treatments in resolving number theory problems requiring authentication of countably infinite conforming sets.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yiming Gao, Yansong Feng, Honggang Hu, Yanbin Pan &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a deterministic algorithm based on Coppersmith's method that employs a rank-3 lattice to address factoring-related problems. An interesting aspect of our approach is that we utilize the second vector in the LLL-reduced basis to avoid trivial collisions in the Baby-step Giant-step method, rather than the shortest vector as is commonly used in the literature. Our results are as follows: 1. Compared to the result by Harvey and Hittmeir (Math. Comp. 91 (2022), 1367 - 1379), who achieved a complexity of O( N^(1/5) log^(16/5) N / (log log N)^(3/5)) for factoring a semiprime N = pq, we demonstrate that in the balanced p and q case, the complexity can be improved to O( N^(1/5) log^(13/5) N / (log log N)^(3/5) ). 2. For factoring sums and differences of powers, that is, numbers of the form N = a^n plus or minus b^n, we improve Hittmeir's result (Math. Comp. 86 (2017), 2947 - 2954) from O( N^(1/4) log^(3/2) N ) to O( N^(1/5) log^(13/5) N ). 3. For the problem of finding r-power divisors, that is, finding all integers p such that p^r divides N, Harvey and Hittmeir (Proceedings of ANTS XV, Research in Number Theory 8 (2022), no. 4, Paper No. 94) recently directly applied Coppersmith's method and achieved a complexity of O( N^(1/(4r)) log^(10+epsilon) N / r^3 ). By using faster LLL-type algorithms and sieving on small primes, we improve their result to O( N^(1/(4r)) log^(7+3 epsilon) N / ((log log N minus log(4r)) r^(2+epsilon)) ). The worst-case running time for their algorithm occurs when N = p^r q with q on the order of N^(1/2). By focusing on this case and employing our rank-3 lattice approach, we achieve a complexity of O( r^(1/4) N^(1/(4r)) log^(5/2) N ). In conclusion, we offer a new perspective on these problems, which we hope will provide further insights.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a classical group defined over the complex numbers with a Borel subgroup $B$. Choose a holomorphic involution of $G$ and let $K$ be its set of fixed points. The group $K$ acts on the flag variety $G/B$ with finitely many orbits and Brion has derived a general formula for the cohomology classes of the corresponding orbit closures as linear combinations of Schubert classes. This article provide a uniform description of the sets of Weyl group elements (which we refer to as Brion atoms) indexing the terms in this formula. This builds on prior work addressing types A, B, and C. The main novelty of our results is a thorough treatment of type D. As one application, we introduce a notion of involution Schubert polynomials for all classical types and present several conjectures related to these objects.</p></details>

Let $\ell$ and $p$ be primes which are coprime to $6N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}({\mathrm cond}(λ))$. We determine the $\ell$-adic valuation of Hecke $L$-values $L(1,λχ)/Ω_K$ as $χ$ varies over $p$-power order anticyclotomic characters over $K$. As an application, for $p$ inert in $K$, we prove the vanishing of the $μ$-invariant of Rubin's $p$-adic $L$-function, leading to the first results on the $μ$-invariant of imaginary quadratic fields at non-split primes. Our approach and results complement the work of Hida and Finis. The approach is rooted in the arithmetic of a CM form on a definite Shimura set.The application to Rubin's $p$-adic $L$-function also relies on the proof of his conjecture. Along the way, we present an automorphic view on Rubin's theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study \emph{fake Mobius-type functions on the unit circle}: multiplicative functions $\mathfrak f$ determined by prime-power data $\mathfrak f(p^k)=\varepsilon_k\in\mathbb S^1\cup\{0\}$, independent of $p$. Their Dirichlet series admits the Euler product $$ F_{\mathfrak f}(s)=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\mathfrak f(n)}{n^s} =\prod_p g(p^{-s}),\qquad g(u)=\sum_{k\ge0}\varepsilon_k u^k, $$ and a canonical zeta-factorization $$ F_{\mathfrak f}(s)=ζ(s)^{\,z}\,ζ(2s)^{\,w}\,G_{\mathfrak f}(s), \qquad z=\varepsilon_1,\ \ w=\varepsilon_2-\frac{\varepsilon_1(\varepsilon_1+1)}{2}, $$ where $G_{\mathfrak f}(s)$ is a holomorphic Euler product on $\Re s>1/3$. Assuming the Riemann hypothesis and simplicity of zeros, we derive a general explicit and asymptotic formula for the summatory functions $A_{\mathfrak f}^{\exp}(x)$ of the form $$ A_{\mathfrak f}^{\exp}(x) -Δ_1(x;z,w) = Δ_{1/2}(x;z,w)\;+\;\sum_ρΔ_ρ(x;z,w,\mathfrak f)\;+\;\mathcal E(x), $$ where $Δ_1(x;z,w)$ is the main term coming from the $s=1$ singularity of $ζ(s)^z$, $Δ_{1/2}(x;z,w)$ is the secondary term coming from the $s=1/2$ singularity of $ζ(2s)^w$, the terms $Δ_ρ(x;z,w,\mathfrak f)$ arise from the singularities of $ζ(s)^z$ at nontrivial zeros $ρ$ of $ζ(s)$, and $\mathcal E(x)$ is an error term. Furthermore, we introduce a notion of \emph{bias} at the natural scale $x^{1/2}(\Log x)^{w-1}$ and obtain an explicit criteria distinguishing persistent, apparent, and unbiased behavior in this regime. The present paper treats the major parameter region $$ -1\le\Re(z)\le1,\qquad -2\le\Re(w)<1, $$ and we choose to defer the complementary ranges of $(z,w)$ to a future paper as a different analytic approach is required there.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Schurian-finiteness, also known as $τ$-tilting finiteness, is equivalent to the finiteness of various representation theoretic objects such as wide subcategories. The first three authors classified Schurian-finite blocks of type A Hecke algebras in [ALS23]. Here we study the Schurian-finiteness of blocks of type B Hecke algebras, and determine the Schurian-finiteness of all blocks if the Hecke algebra is `non-integral', and for almost all blocks in the integral case. The only remaining cases are a small number of blocks in defect $3$ when $e=3$, and a family of blocks in defects $3$ and $4$ for $e\geqslant4$. The classification is mostly achieved by methods using decomposition numbers, with many degenerate cases requiring direct study using standard methods from the representation theory of quivers.</p></details>

We state conjectures on the existence of Minkowski dimension, as well as proposed characterizations of cases in which it takes its minimal and maximal values. We establish basic cases in which the upper Minkowski dimension of $G_{f,α}$ is not maximal, and we establish basic cases in which it is minimal. We show that abelian automorphism groups always have vanishing Minkowski dimension, and as a consequence, that one of our conjectures implies a conjecture of Andrews-Petsche on pairs $(f,α)$ with abelian arboreal Galois group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unit-generated orders of a quadratic field are orders of the form $\mathcal{O} = \mathbb{Z}[\varepsilon]$, where $\varepsilon$ is a unit in the quadratic field. If the order $\mathcal{O}$ is a maximal order of a real quadratic field, then the quadratic number field is necessarily of a restricted form, being of narrow Richaud--Degert type. However, every real quadratic field contains infinitely many distinct unit-generated orders. They are parametrized as $\mathcal{O} = \mathcal{O}_{n}^{\pm}$ having quadratic discriminants $Δ(\mathcal{O}) = Δ_{n}^{+} = n^2 - 4$ (for $n \geq 3$) and $Δ(\mathcal{O}) = Δ_{n}^{-} = n^2 + 4$ (for $n \geq 1$). We show the (wide or narrow) class numbers of unit-generated orders satisfy $\log \left|{\rm Cl}(\mathcal{O})\right| \sim \log \frac{1}{2}\left|Δ(\mathcal{O})\right|$ as $\left|Δ(\mathcal{O})\right| \to \infty$, using a result of L.-K. Hua. We deduce that there are finitely many unit-generated quadratic orders of class number one and finitely many unit-generated quadratic orders whose class group is $2$-torsion. We classify all unit-generated real quadratic maximal orders having class number one. We provide numerical lists of quadratic unit-generated orders whose class groups are $2$-torsion for $Δ\leq 10^{10}$, for both wide and narrow class groups, which are conjecturally complete.</p></details>

We prove that the geometric étale cohomology of $X$ with $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$-coefficients has finitely many classes invariant under the Galois group of the maximal Kummer extension of $K$ in odd degrees. In particular, every abelian variety has finite torsion over the maximal Kummer extension. This improves results by Rössler and the second author as well as Murotani and Ozeki.

We give in particular asymptotic estimates for the location and the number of extraneous zeros on or close to the real line. This result reveals the surprising existence of Fourier nonuniqueness pairs whose apparent ``excess'' compared to the Fourier uniqueness pair of Radchenko and Viazovska may be made arbitrarily large.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce integer sequences satisfying new congruence properties inspired by the Euler and Gauss congruences, which we call Euler-Gauss sequences. Noting that every Gauss sequence is an Euler-Gauss sequence, we compare them with certain generalisations of Gauss sequences and provide several counterexamples. In particular, the Smallest Prime Factor (SPF) and Greatest Prime Factor (GPF) sequences (suitably defined at 1) studied extensively by Erdos and Alladi arise as natural examples of Euler-Gauss sequences that are not Gauss sequences. We further extend these congruence-based integer sequences to a q-analog setting and establish characteristic properties that reveal their structure and fill gaps in the literature on q-Gauss sequences. In recent works, q-Gauss sequences have been shown to admit interesting combinatorial interpretations and to exhibit the Cyclic Sieving Phenomenon (CSP). Not only do our q-Euler-Gauss sequences satisfy the standard CSP with some restriction, but we also derive a new CSP condition for the SPF and GPF sequences, not hitherto known in the literature.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the structure of the invariant subring of the tensor algebra $T(W)$ of a $G$-representation $W$, viewed as a twisted commutative algebra (tca). For a faithful representation $W$ of a finite group $G$ over a field $k$, we show that if char$(k) \mid \#G$, then $T(W)^G$ is not finitely generated as a tca. In contrast, for a representation $W$ of a classical group $G_{\mathbb{Z}}$, we prove that the invariant subring $T(W_k)^{G_k}$ is finitely generated as a tca when $k$ is algebraically closed of sufficiently large characteristic, provided that $W$ admits a good filtration over $\mathbb{Z}$. Finally, we introduce a categorical variant of the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension and compute its value to be $\binom{n+1}{2}$ for $T(\mathbb{C}^n)$ as a tca. Our key insight is to use the Schur functor to reduce questions about noncommutative invariants to those concerning vector invariants.</p></details>

We establish a connection between these determinants and the special values of Dirichlet L-functions, thereby extending Guo's results to arbitrary positive integers n. In addition, we also prove a conjecture raised by Zhi-Wei Sun. Our main tool is the spectral decomposition of some linear operators. By the same method we obtain an explicit formula for the determinants of sine matrices. This formula is expressed as a product of Gauss sums attached to Dirichlet characters.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate Dirichlet-type series generated by representation functions that count the number of ways an integer can be expressed as a sum of 'k' signed higher even powers. By combining generalized theta generating functions with a family of generalized cotangent series introduced in previous work, we derive two distinct explicit lower bounds for these series. The first estimate arises from a geometric restriction of the lattice to its diagonal, while the second utilizes Holder's inequality on the integral representation of the series. The methods presented here avoid modular techniques and offer a flexible analytic framework for higher-power representation problems.</p></details>

Along the way, we derive a new characterization of the $n$ that appear in the sets $S_{k}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 28 pages, comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a new framework for the study of homological properties for (compactly generated) triangulated categories such as regularity, finiteness of global or finitistic dimension, gorensteinness or injective generation and the relation between them. Our approach focuses on distinguished, intrinsically defined, subcategories and our main tool is the new notion of far-away orthogonality. We observe that these homological properties generalise previously studied properties on derived categories of modules over rings, and we use the generality of our theory to also examine those same attributes for the homotopy category of injectives and the big singularity category (in the sense of Krause) of an Artin algebra, as well as the derived category of a non-positive differential graded algebra. Finally, using our theory we recover and generalise various results in the theory of recollements of triangulated categories.</p></details>

Furthermore, two points in C are equivalent if and only if they are related by a group of order 24 acting on C. There exists a set of 3 invariant polynomials that separates equivalence classes of 5-qubit AME states. We also show that every 4-qubit pure code is equivalent to a subspace of the unique ((4,4,2)) and construct an infinite family of 3-uniform n-qubit states for even $n\geq 6$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We generalize the notion of (geometric) substitution rule to obtain overlapping substitutions. Our motivating example is the substitution presented in Ziherl, Dotera and Bekku \cite{DBZ}, which features a substitution matrix with non-integer entries. We give the meaning of such a matrix by showing that the right Perron--Frobenius eigenvector encodes the patch frequency of the resulting tiling. The patch frequencies are shown to be uniformly convergent, implying that the corresponding dynamical system is uniquely ergodic. Under mild assumptions, we further prove that the associated expansion constant is always an algebraic integer. In general, overlapping substitutions may yield a patch with illegal (partial) overlaps of tiles, even if it is locally consistent. We provide a sufficient condition for an overlapping substitution to be consistent, ensuring that no such illegal tiles emerge. Finally, we construct many intriguing one-dimensional overlapping substitutions and present higher dimensional examples from Delone multi-sets with inflation symmetry.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This paper requires significant revision to address mathematical gaps identified by expert reviewers. The claim of a complete proof is not justified in its current form. I am withdrawing to properly address these issues

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>While Kronecker coefficients $g(λ,μ,ν)$ with bounded rows are polynomial-time computable via lattice-point methods, no explicit closed-form formulas have been obtained for genuinely three-row cases in the 87 years since Murnaghan's foundational work. This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse. We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge. We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \mod 2)$ for all $n \geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This paper requires significant revision to address mathematical gaps identified by expert reviewers. The claim of a complete proof is not justified in its current form. I am withdrawing to properly address these issues

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Saxl's conjecture (2012) asserts that for the staircase partition $ρ_k = (k, k-1, \ldots, 1)$, the tensor square of the corresponding irreducible representation of the symmetric group $S_{T_k}$ contains every irreducible representation as a constituent, where $T_k = k(k+1)/2$ is the $k$th triangular number. We prove this conjecture unconditionally. Our proof introduces the Staircase Minimality Theorem: among all 2-regular partitions of $T_k$, the staircase $ρ_k$ is the unique dominance-minimal element. Combined with Ikenmeyer's theorem on dominance and Kronecker positivity for staircases, this establishes that every 2-regular partition appears in the tensor square. Modular saturation then follows using only the diagonal entries $d_{μμ} = 1$ of the decomposition matrix, and the Bessenrodt--Bowman--Sutton lifting theorem completes the proof. We further prove that at triangular numbers, staircases are the only Kronecker-universal self-conjugate partitions, providing a complete characterization.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ and $B$ be subsets of a finite group $G$ and $r$ a positive integer. If for every $g\in G$, there are precisely $r$ pairs $(a,b)\in A\times B$ such that $g=ab$, then $B$ is called a code in $G$ with respect to $A$ and we write $r G=A\boldsymbol{\cdot}B$. If in addition $B$ is a subgroup of $G$, then we say that $B$ is a subgroup code in $G$. In this paper we resolve a conjecture by Green and Liebeck \cite[Conjecture 2.3]{Green20} on certain subgroup codes in the symmetric group $S_n$. Let $n>2k$ and let $j$ be such that $2^j\leqslant k<2^{j+1}$. Suppose that $X$ is a conjugacy class in $S_n$ containing $x$, and $Y_k$ is the subgroup $S_k\times S_{n-k}$ of $S_n$, where the factor $S_k$ permutes the subset $\{1,\ldots,k\}$ and the factor $S_{n-k}$ permutes the subset $\{k+1,\ldots,n\}$. We prove that $r S_n=X\boldsymbol{\cdot}Y_k$ for some positive integer $r$ if and only if the cycle type of $x$ has exactly one cycle of length $2^i$ for $0\leqslant i\leqslant j$ and all other cycles have length at least $k+1$. We also propose several problems concerning the existence of certain subgroup codes in a finite group $G$ with respect to a conjugation-closed subset in $G$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 37 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is devoted to studying two important classes of objects in triangulated categories; silting objects and $d$-cluster tilting objects, and their correspondences. First, we introduce the notion of $d$-silting objects as a generalization tilting objects whose endomorphism algebras have global dimension at most $d$. For a smooth dg algebra $A$ and its $(d+1)$-Calabi-Yau completion $Π$, we show that the induction functor gives an embedding from the poset $\mathrm{silt}^dA$ of $d$-silting objects of $A$ to the poset $\mathrm{silt}Π$ of silting objects of $Π$. Moreover, when $H^0Π$ is finite dimensional, this functor identifies the Hasse quiver of $\mathrm{silt}^dA$ as a full subquiver of the Hasse quiver of $\mathrm{silt}Π$. In this case, we also prove that each $d$-silting object $P$ of $A$ gives a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of $\mathrm{per} A$ as the $ν[-d]$-orbit of $P$. Secondly, for a connective Calabi-Yau dg algebra $Π$, we study the map from $\mathrm{silt}Π$ to the set $d\text{-}\mathrm{ctilt}\mathcal{C}(Π)$ of $d$-cluster tilting objects in the cluster category $\mathcal{C}(Π)$. We call $Π$ $\mathcal{F}$-liftable if the induced map $\mathrm{silt}Π\cap\mathcal{F}\to d\text{-}\mathrm{ctilt}\mathcal{C}(Π)$ is bijective, where $\mathcal{F}$ is the fundamental domain in $\mathrm{per}Π$. We prove that $\mathcal{F}$-liftable Calabi-Yau dg algebras $Π$ such that $H^0Π$ is hereditary are precisely the Calabi-Yau completions of hereditary algebras. As an application, we obtain counter-examples to an open question posed in [IYa1]. We also study Calabi-Yau dg algebras such that the map $\mathrm{silt}Π\to d\text{-}\mathrm{ctilt}\mathcal{C}(Π)$ is surjective, which we call liftable. We explain our results by polynomial dg algebras and Calabi-Yau completions of type $A_2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper focuses on an integer-valued function $f_A(σ) := \mathrm{tr}(A P_σ)$ defined uniformly from a specific square matrix $A$ of order $n$ and a permutation $σ$ on the symmetric group $S_n$. The main objective of this study is to investigate in detail the algebraic behavior of the Alternating Power Difference (APD), denoted as $APD_m(f_A)$, and its first appearance degree $m_1(f_A)$ for this function $f_A$ across various matrix classes. Specifically, we address special matrices such as shifted $r$-th power lattices, Vandermonde matrices, and circulant matrices, analyzing the phenomenon where the value of $APD_m(A)$ remains zero as $m$ increases until a specific degree (the first appearance phenomenon). In particular, we explore closed-form formulas for the first appearance degree $m_1(A)$ and the first appearance value $APD_{m_1}(A)$, presenting Conjectures that hold across multiple matrix classes. These results suggest a deep relationship between the structure of matrices and the analytical properties of functions on the symmetric group, providing new perspectives in matrix theory and combinatorics.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study the framed rook algebra, a structure that unifies two significant generalizations of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra. The first one, introduced by Solomon, extends the Hecke algebra to the full matrix monoid, yielding the rook monoid algebra. The second one, developed by Yokonuma, replaces the Borel subgroup with the unipotent subgroup, resulting in the Yokonuma-Hecke algebra. Our concrete algebra is constructed from the double cosets of the unipotent subgroup within the full matrix monoid. We show that this double coset decomposition is indexed by the framed symmetric inverse monoid. We also define the Rook Yokonuma-Hecke algebra as an abstract structure using generators and relations. We then prove the main isomorphism theorem, which establishes that this abstract algebra is isomorphic to the framed rook algebra under a specific parameter specialization. To complete our characterization, we provide a faithful representation on a tensor space and establish a linear basis for the Rook Yokonuma-Hecke algebra.</p></details>

The proof of the commutativity requires new technical tools, namely a formula for how taking fixed points commutes with extended tensor products of finite sets with group actions and how the Brauer construction commutes with taking extended tensor products of $p$-permutation modules.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we present a method based on contour integration to investigate a class of cyclotomic parametric Apéry-like series. The general term of such series involves a parametric central binomial coefficient, which is defined via the Gamma function. Using this approach, we express a family of cyclotomic Apéry-like series in terms of multiple polylogarithms, cyclotomic Hurwitz zeta values, Riemann zeta values and $\log(2)$. In particular, we provide several illustrative examples and corollaries, which enable us to recover a number of known results on Apéry-like series. At the same time, we have also left open two questions regarding Apéry-like series. Moreover, by considering integrals of the generating function for Fuss-Catalan numbers, we derive an alternative expression for a classical Apéry-like series.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We undertake the study of complex rank analogues of parabolic category O defined using Deligne categories. We regard these categories as a family over an affine space, introduce a stratification on this parameter space, and formulate conjectures on the structural constancy of fibers on each stratum. Using the theory of $\mathfrak{sl}_{\mathbb{Z}}$-categorification, we prove these conjectures for admissible strata. Namely, we axiomatize the notion of multi-Fock tensor product categorifications (MFTPCs), which are interval finite highest weight categories equipped with a compatible action of commuting copies of $\mathfrak{sl}_{\mathbb{Z}}$, categorifying an external tensor product of tensor products of highest and lowest weight Fock space representations. We prove a uniqueness theorem for admissible MFTPCs and show that complex rank parabolic categories O have the structure of MFTPCs. In turn, for suitable choices of parameters, we produce an equivalence of complex rank category O with a stable limit of classical parabolic categories O, resolving our conjecture in the admissible case. These equivalences yield multiplicities of simple objects in Verma modules in terms of stable parabolic Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials, answering a question posed by Etingof. In particular, for the case of two Levi blocks of non-integral size, we completely describe the structure of the corresponding category O in terms of stable representation theory. As an application, we obtain multiplicities for parabolic analogs of hyperalgebra Verma modules introduced by Haboush in the large rank and large characteristic limit.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Heilbronn gave a sufficient condition for a number field with a totally ramified prime to fail to be norm-Euclidean. We say that Heilbronn's criterion applies to a polynomial $f$ if it applies to the number field $K=\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f)$ generated by $f$. Suppose $n\geq 3$ is odd and $p\geq 5$ is prime with $\gcd(p-1,n)=1$. Let ${F}_{p,n}$ denote the collection of monic polynomials $f\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ of degree $n$ that are Eisenstein at the prime $p$. We order our polynomials by the natural height $\mathrm{Ht}(f)$. Define $δ_{p,n}(X)$ to be the proportion of polynomials $f\in {F}_{p,n}$ with $\mathrm{Ht}(f)\leq X$ for which Heilbronn's criterion applies. One has $$\liminf_{X\to\infty}δ_{p,n}(X)\geq \max\left\{\frac{2}{27}\,,\;1-\varepsilon(p)\right\}\,,$$ where $\varepsilon(p)\to 0$ and is effectively computable. In particular, the lower density tends to $1$ as $p\to\infty$ uniformly in $n$. We also give a version of this result where we weaken the condition on $\gcd(p-1,n)$. As a corollary, we show that given an integer $n\geq 2$, a positive proportion of Eisenstein polynomials of degree $n$ fail to generate norm-Euclidean fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the first part of the paper, we fix a non-CM elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ and an odd prime $\ell$ and investigate the distribution of invariants associated to the $\ell$-volcano containing the reduction $E_p$, as $p$ ranges over primes of good ordinary reduction. Let $H(p)$ be the height of the volcano and let $d'(p)$ denote the relative position of $j(E_p)$ above the floor, and let $r\ge 0$ be an integer. Assuming that the $\ell$-adic Galois representation attached to $E$ is surjective, we derive an explicit formula for the natural density of primes $p$ for which $H(p)=r$ (resp.\ $d'(p)=r$). In the non-surjective case, we show that all sufficiently large heights occur with positive density. In the second part of the paper, we analyze the distribution of $\ell$-volcano heights over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ and consider the limit as $q\to\infty$. Using analytic estimates for sums of Hurwitz class numbers in arithmetic progressions, we compute exact limiting densities for ordinary elliptic curves whose $\ell$-isogeny graph has a prescribed height $r$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X$ be an algebraic variety over $\mathbb{C}$ and $G$ be an algebraic group acting on $X$ whose action is closed. J. Poineau defined a compactification $X^\urcorner$ of $X(\mathbb{C})$ by using hybrid Berkovich spaces. We will focus on the extension of the action of $G$ on this compactification by characterising the set $\mathcal{U} \subset X^\urcorner$ where the action is well defined. We will also show that the quotient of $\mathcal{U}$ by the action of $G$ is homeomorphic to $(X/G)^\urcorner$, the compactification of $(X/G)(\mathbb{C})$. We then apply these results to $X = \mathrm{Rat}_d$, the space of rational maps and $G = \mathrm{SL}_2$. It gives the results of C. Favre-C. Gong in a more general setting. Furthermore, we get a compactification of $\mathrm{M}_d = \mathrm{Rat}_d/\mathrm{SL}_2$ where the boundary is made of orbits of non-archimedean rational maps. The results still holds if $\mathbb{C}$ is replaced by $k$ a non-trivially valued field and complex analytic spaces by Berkovich spaces over $k$ or if $X$ is the set of stable points of a $k$-variety defined in the sense of GIT.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a semisimple compact Lie group $G$ and a nonzero dominant integral weight $λ$, the highest weight $G_q$-modules $V_{nλ}$ form a subproduct system of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Using a conjectural asymptotic behavior of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients we identify the corresponding Cuntz-Pimsner algebras with algebras of quantized functions on homogeneous spaces of $G$. We also show that the gauge-invariant part of the Toeplitz algebra provides a model for convergence of full matrix algebras to quantum flag manifolds, complementing and generalizing results of Landsman and Rieffel for $q=1$ and results of Vaes-Vergnioux in the rank one case for $q\ne1$. We verify our conjecture on Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for $G=SU(n)$ and all weights that are either regular or multiples of the fundamental weight $ω_1$. For $λ=ω_1$, we also provide a detailed description of the Toeplitz and Cuntz-Pimsner algebras, generalizing results of Arveson on symmetric subproduct systems.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the low-lying zeros of a family of $L$-functions attached to the CM elliptic curve $E_d \;:\; y^2 = x^3 - dx$, for each odd and square-free integer $d$. Specifically, upon writing the $L$-function of $E_d$ as $L(s-\frac12, ξ_d)$ for the appropriate Grössencharakter $ξ_d$ of conductor $\mathfrak{f}_d$, we consider the collection $\mathcal{F}_d$ of $L$-functions attached to $ξ_{d,k}$, $k \geq 1$, where for each integer $k$, $ξ_{d, k}$ denotes the primitive character inducing $ξ_d^k$. We observe that $25\%$ of the $L$-functions in $\mathcal{F}_d$ have negative root number. $\mathcal{F}_d$ is thus not one of the essentially homogeneous families of the Universality Conjecture of Sarnak, Shin and Templier, with unitary, symplectic or orthogonal (odd or even) symmetry type. By computing the one-level density in the family of $L$-functions in $\mathcal{F}_{d}$ with conductor at most $K^2 \mathrm N (\mathfrak{f}_d)$, we find that $\mathcal{F}_d$ naturally decomposes into subfamilies: more specifically, a collection of symplectic ($L(s, ξ_{d,k})$ for $k \equiv α\bmod 8$, $α$ even) and orthogonal ($L(s, ξ_{d,k})$ for $k \equiv α\bmod 8$, $α$ odd) subfamilies. For each such subfamily, we moreover compute explicit lower order terms in decreasing powers of $\log (K^2 \mathrm N(\mathfrak{f}_d))$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1973 Montgomery formulated the pair correlation conjecture, predicting that the local spacing statistics of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function coincide with those of eigenvalues of large Hermitian matrices from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). The zeta function, however, is a fixed deterministic object, and the mechanism by which its zeros reproduce random matrix statistics has remained unclear. In this paper, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we prove Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of Hardy's $Z$-function. Building on earlier works, we use a finite-dimensional variational space of sections $Z_N(t;a)$ that approximate $Z(t)$ on each window $[2N,2N+2]$. Inside this space we define the real hall $\mathcal{RH}_N(\mathbb{R})$, consisting of those sections whose zeros in the corresponding critical rectangle are real, simple, and remain so along any homotopy from the core section. This real hall plays the role of a random matrix ensemble. Equipping it with an admissible probability measure with smooth, positive density on the coefficient space, we construct a Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equation with reflection at the discriminant boundary. We show that the induced dynamics of the unfolded zeros are, in the bulk, equivalent in law to Dyson Brownian motion with $β=2$, and by invoking modern universality results for Dyson Brownian motion and log-gases we obtain that, for any such measure, the ensemble-averaged local pair-correlation converges to the GUE sine-kernel law. Finally, using Selberg's probabilistic theory of the argument $S(t)$, we prove that the pair-correlation observables of the canonical approximants $Z_N(t;1)$ over disjoint windows behave asymptotically like decorrelated samples drawn from this GUE-distributed ensemble, and we upgrade the averaged GUE law to a deterministic pair-correlation law for the zeros of $Z(t)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We examine the cell modules for the category of type An webs and their natural cellular forms. We modify the bases of these modules, as described by Elias, to obtain an orthogonal basis of each cell module. Hence, we calculate the determinant of the Gram matrix with respect to such bases. These Gram determinants are given in terms of intersection forms, computed from certain traces of clasps - higher order Jones-Wenzl morphisms. Additionally, the modified basis is constructed using these clasps, and each clasp is constructed using traces of smaller clasps. Elias conjectures a value for these intersection forms and verifies it in types $A_1$, $A_2$ and $A_3$. This paper concludes with a proof of the conjecture in type $A_n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a rigorous proof of the Gang-Yonekura formula describing the transformation of the 3D index under Dehn filling a cusp in an orientable 3-manifold. The 3D index, originally introduced by Dimofte, Gaiotto and Gukov, is a physically inspired q-series that encodes deep topological and geometric information about cusped 3-manifolds. Building on the interpretation of the 3D index as a generating function over Q-normal surfaces, we introduce a relative version of the index for ideal triangulations with exposed boundary. This notion allows us to formulate a relative Gang-Yonekura formula, which we prove by developing a gluing principle for relative indices and establishing an inductive framework in the case of layered solid tori. Our approach makes use of Garoufalidis-Kashaev's meromorphic extension of the index, along with new identities involving q-hypergeometric functions. As an application, we study the limiting behaviour of the index for large fillings. We also develop code to perform certified computations of the index, guaranteeing correctness up to a specified accuracy. Our extensive computations support the topological invariance of the 3D index and suggest a well-defined extension to closed manifolds.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $$ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}A(n)q^{n} := \frac{(q^{2};q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}(q^{3};q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}}{(q;q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}(q^{4};q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}}, $$ $$ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} B(n)q^{n} := \frac{(q;q^{5})_{\infty}^{5} (q^{4};q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}} {(q^{2};q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}(q^{3}; q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}}, $$ and $$ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} D(n)q^{n} := \frac{(q^{5};q^{25})_{\infty}(q^{20}; q^{25})_{\infty}} {(q^{10};q^{25})_{\infty}(q^{15}; q^{25})_{\infty}} \frac{(q^{2}; q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}(q^{3};q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}} {(q;q^{5})_{\infty}^{5} (q^{4};q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}} $$ where $(a;q)_{\infty} := \prod_{k=0}^{\infty}(1-aq^{k})$ and $|q|<1.$ These sequences are closely related to the celebrated Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction. In this paper, we study the sign behavior o of the coefficients $A(n),B(n)$ and $D(n).$ We prove that for all integers $n\geq0,$ \begin{align*} A(5n)<0\quad(n\neq0),\qquad B(5n) < 0\quad(n\neq0),\qquad D(5n+1)>0. \end{align*} This confirms a recent conjecture of Baruah and Sarma. Our proof is different from the previous method of Baruah and Sarma, and combines asymptotic coefficient analysis with symbolic computation for finite case verification.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Classical diagram categories and monoids, including the Temperley--Lieb, Brauer, and partition cases, arise as special instances of the category of two dimensional cobordisms and admit additional twists that produce a large new family of diagram categories and monoids.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $b\geq3$ be an integer and $C(b,D)$ be the set of real numbers in $[0,1]$ whose $b$-ary expansion consists of digits restricted to a given set $D\subseteq\{0,\ldots,b-1\}$. Given an integer $t\geq2$ and a real, positive function $ψ$, let $W_{t}(ψ)$ denote the set of $x$ in $[0,1]$ for which $|x-p/t^{n}|<ψ(n)$ for infinitely many $(p,n)\in\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{N}$. We prove a general Hausdorff dimension result concerning the intersection of $W_{t}(ψ)$ with an arbitrary self similar set which implies that $\dim_{\rm H}(W_{t}(ψ)\cap C(b,D))\le\dim_{\rm H}W_{t}(ψ)\times \dim_{\rm H}C(b,D)$. When $b$ and $t$ have the same prime divisors, under certain restrictions on the digit set $D$, we give a sufficient condition for the Hausdorff measure of $W_{t}(ψ)\cap C(b,D)$ to be zero. This closes a gap in a result of Li, Li and Wu \cite{LLW2025} and shows that the dimension of the intersection can be strictly less than the product of the dimensions. The latter disproves the product conjecture of Li, Li and Wu.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Shuichi Hayashida &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There are three aims in this paper: (i) We show an isomorphism between Jacobi forms of index $D_{2n+1}$ (lattice index) and elliptic modular forms of level $2$. (ii) We give an explicit formula of Fourier coefficients of Jacobi-Eisenstein series of index $D_{2n+1}$. (iii) We construct a holomorphic modular form of weight $3/2$ of level $8$ from the Zagier Eisenstein series $\mathscr{F}$ of weight $3/2$ of level $4$. Moreover, we show that the four functions $E^*_2$, $η^3$, $θ^3$ and $\mathscr{F}$ have essentially the same Hecke eigenvalue $1+p$ for any odd prime $p$, where $E^*_2$ is the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series of weight $2$, $η$ is the Dedekind eta-function and $θ$ is the usual theta function. This fact follows from a special case of the isomorphism of (i). As an application, we give a formula for a sum of the numbers $r_3(n)$, where $r_3(n)$ is the number of representations of an integer $n \geq 0$ as a sum of $3$ squares.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Building upon the work of Stucker, Vennos, and Young we derive generalized Dedekind sums arising from period integrals applied to holomorphic Eisenstein series attached to pairs of primitive non-trivial Dirichlet characters. Furthermore, we explore a variety of properties of these generalized Dedekind sums: we develop a finite sum formula, demonstrate their behavior as quantum modular forms, provide a Fricke reciprocity law, and characterize analytic and arithmetic aspects of their image. Particularly, for the arithmetic aspect of the image, we generalize an existing conjecture to the higher weight case and provide significant computational evidence to support this generalized conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the presence of a nontrivial dual Selmer group, certain global even deformation rings are shown to be finite and flat over $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Previously, flatness was only known in established cases of Langlands reciprocity in the odd parity. By techniques from global class field theory, explicit examples of even representations are computed to which the results apply. For even representations $\overlineρ$ in an explicit family, it is observed that if Leopoldt's conjecture is true for a certain number field attached to $\overlineρ$, then the global even deformation ring is flat at the minimal level.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An endomorphism $f:\mathbb{P}^k\to\mathbb{P}^k$ of degree $d\geq2$ is said to be postcritically finite (or PCF) if its critical set $\mathrm{Crit}(f)$ is preperiodic, i.e. if there are integers $m>n\geq0$ such that $f^m(\mathrm{Crit}(f))\subseteq f^n(\mathrm{Crit}(f))$. When $k\geq2$, it was conjectured by Ingram, Ramadas and Silverman that, in the space $\mathrm{End}_d^k$ of all endomorphisms of degree $d$ of $\mathbb{P}^k$, such endomorphisms are not Zariski dense. We prove this conjecture. Further, in the space $\mathrm{Poly}_d^2$ of all regular polynomial endomorphisms of degree $d\geq2$ of the affine plane $\mathbb{A}^2$, we construct a dense and Zariski open subset where we have a uniform bound on the number of preperiodic points lying in the critical set. The proofs are a combination of the theory of heights in arithmetic dynamics and methods from real dynamics to produce open subsets with maximal bifurcation.</p></details>
