 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Markus Hittmeir &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $γ$-$\mathsf{GapSVP}_p$ be the decision version of the shortest vector problem in the $\ell_p$-norm with approximation factor $γ$, let $n$ be the lattice dimension and $0<\varepsilon\leq 1$. We prove that the following statements hold for infinitely many values of $p$. $(2-\varepsilon)$-$\mathsf{GapSVP}_p$ is not in $O\left(2^{O(p)}\cdot n^{O(1)}\right)$-time, unless $\text{P}=\text{NP}$. $(2-\varepsilon)$-$\mathsf{GapSVP}_p$ is not in $O\left(2^{2^{o(p)}}\cdot 2^{o(n)}\right)$-time, unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis is false. The proofs are based on a Karp reduction from a variant of the subset-sum problem that imposes restrictions on vectors orthogonal to the vector of its weights. While more extensive hardness results for the shortest vector problem in all $\ell_p$-norms have already been established under randomized reductions, the results in this paper are fully deterministic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the (toric) local height of a toric variety with respect to a semipositive torus-invariant singular metric is given by the integral of a concave function over a compact convex set. This generalizes a result of Burgos, Philippon, and Sombra for the case of continuous metrics and answers a question raised by Burgos, Kramer, and Kühn in 2016.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A sequence $S=(x_1,\ldots, x_k)$ in $\mathbb Z_p$ is called a $(Q_p,\mathbf 1)$-weighted zero-sum sequence if there exist $a_1,\ldots,a_k\in Q_p$ such that $a_1x_1+\cdots+a_kx_k=0$ and $a_1+\cdots+a_k=0$. The constant $E_{Q_p,\mathbf 1}$ is defined to be the smallest positive integer $k$ such that every sequence of length $k$ in $\mathbb Z_p$ has a $(Q_p,\mathbf 1)$-weighted zero-sum subsequence of length $p$. We determine the constant $E_{Q_p,\mathbf 1}$ and the related constants $C_{Q_p,\mathbf 1}$ and $D_{Q_p,\mathbf 1}$. We also study some $(Q_p,B)$-weighted zero-sum constants where $B$ is a subset of $Q_p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the equality of the values of the $n$th and $k$th elementary symmetric polynomials of $n$ not necessarily distinct positive integers. For $k < n$, we prove that this equation always has a solution, but only finitely many solutions. Furthermore, we consider the equality of the values of the $n$th and $(n-2)$th elementary symmetric polynomials of $n$ not necessarily distinct positive integers. In particular, we show that the number of solutions of this equation tends to infinity if $n$ tends to infinity.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nat Sothanaphan &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a writeup of a resolution of Erdős Problem #728; this is the first Erdős problem (a problem proposed by Paul Erdős which has been collected in the Erdős Problems website) regarded as fully resolved autonomously by an AI system. The system in question is a combination of GPT-5.2 Pro by OpenAI and Aristotle by Harmonic, operated by Kevin Barreto. The final result of the system is a formal proof written in Lean, which we translate to informal mathematics in the present writeup for wider accessibility. The proved result is as follows. We show a logarithmic-gap phenomenon regarding factorial divisibility: For any constants $0<C_1<C_2$ and $0 < \varepsilon < 1/2$ there exist infinitely many triples $(a,b,n)\in\mathbb N^3$ with $\varepsilon n \le a,b \le (1-\varepsilon)n$ such that $$ a!\,b!\mid n!\,(a+b-n)!\qquad\text{and}\qquad C_1\log n < a+b-n < C_2\log n. $$ The argument reduces this to a binomial divisibility $\binom{m+k}{k}\mid\binom{2m}{m}$ and studies it prime-by-prime. By Kummer's theorem, $ν_p\binom{2m}{m}$ translates into a carry count for doubling $m$ in base $p$. We then employ a counting argument to find, in each scale $[M,2M]$, an integer $m$ whose base-$p$ expansions simultaneously force many carries when doubling $m$, for every prime $p\le 2k$, while avoiding the rare event that one of $m+1,\dots,m+k$ is divisible by an unusually high power of $p$. These "carry-rich but spike-free" choices of $m$ force the needed $p$-adic inequalities and the divisibility. The overall strategy is similar to results regarding divisors of $\binom{2n}{n}$ studied earlier by Erdős and by Pomerance.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this short note, we study the spectrum of prime Serre ideals of global represen tations for noetherian families. In particular, we prove that the spectrum of prime Serre ideals of finitely generated VI-modules is homeomorphic to N^{*}, the one-point compactification of N, which differs from the Balmer spectrum of derived VI-modules. Our method could also be applied to the category of finitely generated FI-modules and the category of global representations for the family of cyclic p-groups.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02982v3'>2406.02982</a>\]&nbsp; **Asymptotics for $t$-Core Partitions and Stanton's Conjecture**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Matthew Tyler &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A partition is a $t$-core partition if $t$ is not one of its hook lengths. Let $c_t(N)$ be the number of $t$-core partitions of $N$. In 1999, Stanton conjectured $c_t(N) \le c_{t+1}(N)$ if $4 \le t \ne N-1$. This was proved for $t$ fixed and $N$ sufficiently large by Anderson, and for small values of $t$ by Kim and Rouse. In this paper, we prove Stanton's conjecture in general. Our approach is to find a saddle point asymptotic formula for $c_t(N)$, valid in all ranges of $t$ and $N$. This includes the known asymptotic formulas for $c_t(N)$ as special cases, and shows that the behavior of $c_t(N)$ depends on how $t^2$ compares in size to $N$. For example, our formula implies that if $t^2 = κN + o(t)$, then $c_t(N) = \frac{\exp\left(2π\sqrt{A N}\right)}{B N} (1 + o(1))$ for suitable constants $A$ and $B$ defined in terms of $κ$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jeremy Booher &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 20 pages, implementation at https://github.com/jeremybooher/crystallinecohomology

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over a finite field of characteristic $p$. We describe and implement a practical algorithm for computing the $p$-divisible group $Jac(X)[p^\infty]$ via computing its Dieudonné module, or equivalently computing the Frobenius and Verschiebung operators on the first crystalline cohomology of $X$. We build on Tuitman's $p$-adic point counting algorithm, which computes the rigid cohomology of $X$ and requires a ``nice'' lift of $X$ to be provided.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13471v2'>2506.13471</a>\]&nbsp; **Serre's question on thin sets in projective space**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tijs Buggenhout, Raf Cluckers, Per Salberger, Tim Santens, Floris Vermeulen &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** The authors of arXiv version 1 joined forces with the third author which does justice to the subject and its history (see the rewritten introduction). A separability condition was missing in Theorem 6.1 and is now added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We answer a question of Serre from the 1980s on rational points of bounded height on projective thin sets, in degree at least $4$. For degrees $2$ and $3$ we improve the known bounds in general. The focus is on thin sets of type II, namely corresponding to the images of ramified dominant quasi-finite covers of projective space, as thin sets of type I are already well understood via dimension growth results by the third author in 2002 (published in 2023) by a global variant of Heath-Brown's $p$-adic determinant method. For type II, we obtain a uniform affine variant of Serre's question which implies the projective case and for which the implicit constant is furthermore polynomial in the degree. We are able to avoid logarithmic factors when the degree is at least $5$ and we prove our results over any global field, of any characteristic. A key ingredient for obtaining the affine variant comes from Binyamini-Cluckers-Novikov (2024) and Binyamini-Cluckers-Kato (2025) where a question of the third author was answered by providing bounds, for rational points on irreducible curves, which are quadratic in the degree. A second key ingredient is an adaptation of Salberger's global determinant method to the case of weighted polynomials. The third key ingredient is the design of our affine variant of Serre's question, for weighted polynomials which are not necessarily weighted homogeneous.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03797v2'>2601.03797</a>\]&nbsp; **On difference sets of dense subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^2$**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sayan Goswami &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we study the structure of the difference set $E - E$ for subsets $E \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2$ of positive upper Banach density. Fish asked in [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 146 (2018), 3449-3453] whether, for every such set $E$, there exists a nonzero integer $k$ such that $k \cdot \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \{\, xy : (x,y) \in E - E \,\}.$ Although this question remains open, we establish a relatively weaker form of this conjecture. Specifically, we prove that if $\langle a_j\rangle_{j=1}^m$ is any finite sequence in $\mathbb{N},$ then there exist infinitely many integers $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ and a sequence $\langle x_n \rangle_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ such that $k \cdot MT\left(\langle a_j \rangle_{j=1}^m, \langle x_n\rangle_{n}\right) \subseteq \{\, xy : (x,y) \in E - E \,\},$ where $MT\left(\langle a_j \rangle_{j=1}^m, \langle x_n\rangle_{n}\right)$ denotes the milliken-Taylor configuration generated by the sequences $\langle a_j\rangle_{j=1}^m$ and $\langle x_n \rangle_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 10 pages. Section 5 was added to prove our main results under the assumption that the ABC conjecture is true

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f(x)\in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial of degree $d\ge 1$. Let $k\ge2$ be an integer. The number of integers $n$ such that $f(n)$ is $k$-free is widely studied in the literature. In principle, one expects that $f(n)$ is $k$-free infinitely often, if $f$ has no fixed $k$-th power divisor. In 2022, Bergelson and Richter established a new dynamical generalization of the prime number theorem (PNT). Inspired by their work, one may expect that this generalization of the PNT also holds over integers of power-free polynomial values. In this note, we establish such variants of Bergelson and Richter's theorem for several polynomials studied by Estermann, Hooley, Heath-Brown, Booker and Browning.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2009, Bringmann arXiv:0708.0691 [math.NT] used the circle method to prove an asymptotic formula for the Fourier coefficients of rank generating functions. In this paper, we prove that Bringmann's formula, when summing up to infinity and in the case of prime modulus, gives a Rademacher-type exact formula involving sums of vector-valued Kloosterman sums. As a corollary, in another paper arXiv:2406.07469 [math.NT], we will provide a new proof of Dyson's conjectures by showing that the certain Kloosterman sums vanish.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the context of $p$-adic quantum mechanics, we investigate composite systems of $p$-adic qubits and $p$-adically controlled quantum logic gates. We build on the notion of a single $p$-adic qubit as a two-dimensional irreducible representation of the compact $p$-adic special orthogonal group SO(3)$_p$. We show that the classification of these representations reduces to the finite case, as they all factorise through some finite quotient SO(3)$_p$ mod $p^k$. Then, we tackle the problem of $p$-adic qubit composition and entanglement, fundamental for a $p$-adic formulation of quantum information processing. We classify the representations of SO(3)$_p$ mod $p$, and analyse tensor products of two $p$-adic qubit representations lifted from SO(3)$_p$ mod $p$. We solve the Clebsch-Gordan problem for such systems, revealing that the coupled bases decompose into singlet and doublet states. We further study entanglement arising from those stable subsystems. For $p=3$, we construct a set of gates from $4$-dimensional irreducible representations of SO(3)$_p$ mod $p$ that we prove to be universal for quantum computation.</p></details>

Furthermore, we show that such an equivalence also holds for differential Lie bialgebras, together with their associated Manin triples and corresponding matched pairs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f:\mathbb{A}^N\to\mathbb{A}^N$ be a regular endomorphism of algebraic degree $d\geq2$ (i.e., $f$ extends to an endomorphism on $\mathbb{P}^N$ of algebraic degree $d$) defined over a number field. We prove that if the set of cyclotomic $f$-preperiodic points is Zariski-dense in $\mathbb{A}^N$, then some iterate $f^{\circ l}$ ($l\geq1$) is a quotient of a surjective algebraic group endomorphism $g:\mathbb{G}_m^N\to\mathbb{G}_m^N$, over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. This result generalizes a theorem of Dvornicich and Zannier on cyclotomic preperiodic points of one-variable polynomials to higher dimensions. In fact, we prove a much more general rigidity result for dominant endomorphisms $f$ on an affine variety $X$ defined over a number field, concerning "almost $f$-invariant" Zariski-dense subsets of cyclotomic integral points. We apply our results to backward orbits of regular endomorphisms on $\mathbb{A}^N$ of algebraic degree $d\geq2$, and to periodic points of automorphisms of Hénon type on $\mathbb{A}^N$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 43 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the symmetric multiple Eisenstein series, a variant of the multiple Eisenstein series. As a fundamental result, we show that they satisfy the linear shuffle relation. As a case study, we investigate the vector space spanned by symmetric double Eisenstein series of weight $k$. When $k$ is even, it coincides with the space spanned by modular forms of weight $k$ and the derivative of the Eisenstein series of weight $k-2$. For $k$ odd, we prove that its dimension equals $\lfloor k/3\rfloor$. We further provide an explicit correspondence between the linear shuffle relation and the Fay-shuffle relation satisfied by elliptic double zeta values, which may be of independent interest. In connection with modular forms, we prove that every modular form can be expressed as a linear combination of symmetric triple Eisenstein series. This will serve as a first step toward understanding modular phenomena for symmeric multiple zeta values observed by Kaneko and Zagier.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use the methods introduced by Lue Pan to study the locally analytic vectors of the completed cohomology of Shimura curves associated to an indefinite quaternion algebra $D$ which is ramified at a prime number $p$. Let $D_p^{\times}$ be the group of units of $D$ at $p$. Using $p$-adic uniformization of the quaternionic Shimura curves, we compute the Hecke eigenspace of the completed cohomology with the Hecke eigenvalues associated to a classical automorphic form on another quaternion algebra $\bar D$ (switching invariants of $D$ at $p,\infty$). We present this locally analytic $D_p^\times$-representation using the de Rham complex of the Lubin-Tate tower of dimension $1$. This is analogous to the Breuil-Strauch conjecture for the group $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. We show that the locally analytic $D_p^{\times}$-representation does not detect the Hodge filtration of the local de Rham Galois representation at $p$ in the crystalline case, and also give applications for the locally analytic Jacquet--Langlands correspondence for $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ and $D_p^\times$.</p></details>

In particular, we prove that for any fixed base $b\geq 2$, there exist infinitely many square-free palindromes in base $b$. We also provide an asymptotic expression for the number of such integers $\leq x$. The core of our proof utilises a hybrid $p$-adic/Archimedean van der Corput process, used in conjunction with an equidistribution estimate of Tuxanidy and Panario, as well as an elementary argument of Cilleruelo, Luca and Shparlinski.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a ring isomorphism between the derived Hall algebra of the Jordan quiver and the ring of double symmetric functions (i.e., the ring of symmetric polynomials in two sets of countably many variables, invariant under the respective actions of their symmetric groups) with a parameter $t$. This isomorphism maps the derived Hall basis (the natural basis of the derived Hall algebra) to a class of double Hall-Littlewood (HL) symmetric functions, which are formulated via raising and lowering operators. These double HL functions are parameterized by bipartitions; they reduce to the classical HL functions when one of the partitions is empty, and specialize to Schur Laurent symmetric functions at $t = 0$. We also derive the Pieri rules for these double HL functions. Additionally, we obtain several natural generating functions for the derived Hall algebra as well as their transition relations, which can be transferred to the ring of double symmetric functions via the established ring isomorphism.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a lower bound for the frequency with which an irreducible monic cubic polynomial can be expressed as a sum of two squares ($\square_{2}$). This provides a quantitative answer to a question posed by Grechuk (2021) concerning the infinitude of such values. Our proof relies on a two-dimensional unit argument and the arithmetic of degree six number fields. For example, we show that if $h \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$, then \begin{align*} \# \{n : n^3+h \in \square_{2}, \ 1 \leq n \leq x \} \gg x^{1/3-o(1)}. \end{align*} These arguments may be generalised to study the representation of irreducible monic cubic polynomials by the quadratic form $x^2+ny^2$, where $n \in \mathbb{N}$.</p></details>

The restriction remains integrable and decomposes into irreducible components with finite multiplicities, encoded by pairs of highest weights. We show that this set is closed under addition, extending a result of Brion and Knop to the affine setting.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Tilting theory is one of the central tools in modern representation theory, in particular in the study of Cohen-Macaulay representations. We study Cohen-Macaulay representations of $\mathbb N$-graded Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras $A$ of dimension one, without assuming the connectedness condition. This framework covers a broad class of noncommutative Gorenstein rings, including classical $\mathbb N$-graded Gorenstein orders. We prove that the stable category $\underline{\mathsf{CM}}_0^{\mathbb Z}A$ admits a silting object if and only if $A_0$ has finite global dimension. In this case we give such a silting object explicitly. Assuming that $A$ is ring-indecomposable, we further show that $\underline{\mathsf{CM}}_0^{\mathbb Z}A$ admits a tilting object if and only if either $A$ is Artin-Schelter regular or the average Gorenstein parameter of $A$ is non-positive. These results generalize those of Buchweitz, Iyama, and Yamaura. We give two proofs of the second result: one via Orlov-type semiorthogonal decompositions, and the other via a direct calculation. As an application, we show that for a Gorenstein tiled order $A$, the category $\underline{\mathsf{CM}}^{\mathbb Z}A$ is equivalent to the derived category of the incidence algebra of an explicitly constructed poset. We also apply our results and Koszul duality to study smooth noncommutative projective quadric hypersurfaces $\mathsf{qgr}\,B$ of arbitrary dimension. We prove that $\mathsf{D}^{\mathrm b}(\mathsf{qgr}\,B)$ admits an explicitly constructed tilting object, which contains the tilting object of $\underline{\mathsf{CM}}^{\mathbb Z}B$ due to Smith and Van den Bergh as a direct summand via Orlov's semiorthogonal decomposition.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The mass transference principle of Beresnevich and Velani is a powerful mechanism for determining the Hausdorff dimension/measure of $\limsup$ sets that arise naturally in Diophantine approximation. However, in the setting of dynamical Diophantine approximation, this principle often fails to apply effectively, as the radii of the balls defining the dynamical $\limsup$ sets generally depend on the orbit of the point $x$ itself. In this paper, we develop a dimensional mass transference principle that enables us to recover and extend classical results on shrinking target problems, particularly for the $β$-transformation and the Gauss map. Moreover, our result shows that the corresponding $\limsup$ sets have large intersection properties. A potentially interesting feature of our method is that, in many cases, shrinking target problems are closely related to finding an appropriate Gibbs measure, which may reveal new aspects of the link between thermodynamic formalism and dynamical Diophantine approximation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We obtain new infinite families of identities among special values of Dirichlet $L$-functions using finite spectral sums. More precisely, we study Dirichlet $L$-functions via discrete analogues $L_n$ arising from the spectral theory of cyclic graphs as $n\rightarrow \infty$. Applying a refined Euler-Maclaurin asymptotic expansion due to Sidi, together with an independent polynomiality property of these finite spectral sums at integers, we obtain exact special-value formulas, even starting at $n=1$. This yields new expressions for certain trigonometric sums of interest in physics, and recovers, by a different method, the striking formulas of Xie, Zhao, and Zhao. Concerning zeros, using the same asymptotic expansion, we prove that for odd primitive characters, an asymptotic functional equation relating $L_n(1-s,\overline{χ})$ to $L_n(s,χ)$ is equivalent to the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for the corresponding Dirichlet $L$-function $L(s,χ)$. We also provide some remarks about the non-existence of possible real zeros.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A set $\mathcal S\subset \mathbb N$ is said to be a subset-sum-distinct or dissociated if all of its finite subsets have different sums. Alternately, an equivalent classification is if any equality of the form $$\sum_{s\in \mathcal S} \varepsilon_s \cdot s =0$$ where $\varepsilon_s \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ implies that all the $\varepsilon_s$'s are $0$. For a dissociated set $\mathcal S$, we prove that for $c_\ast = \frac 12 \log_2 \left(\frac π2\right)$ and any $c_\ast-1<C<c_\ast$, we have $$\mathcal S(n) \,:=\, \mathcal S\cap [1,n] \,\le\, \log_2 n +\frac 12 \log_2\log_2 n + C$$ for all $n\in \mathcal N_C$ with asymptotic density $\mathbf d\left(\mathcal N_C\right)=2-2^{c_\ast-C}$. Further, we consider the greedy algorithm for generating these sets and prove that this algorithm always eventually doubles. Finally, we also consider some generalizations of dissociated sets and prove similar results about them.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let Y be a random variable whose moment-generating function exists in some neighborhood of the origin. While probabilistic Stirling numbers of the first and second kind have been introduced, early definitions often failed to satisfy fundamental orthogonality and inverse relations or lacked consistency with classical forms in the case when Y = 1. This paper addresses these limitations by utilizing redefined probabilistic Stirling numbers of the first kind and the second kind alongside their degenerate counterparts. Our primary objective is twofold: first,to introduce the probabilistic (degenerate) logarithm associated with Y, providing explicit expressions for various random variables and defining new probabilistic degenerate Daehee and Cauchy numbers; and second, to investigate probabilistic heterogeneous Stirling numbers and establish a probabilistic degenerate version of the Schlomilch formula, demonstrating that these new frameworks maintain the essential algebraic properties of their classical counterparts.</p></details>

Our main results treat the semisimple case and the general linear case. For a connected semisimple complex algebraic group, invariant $D$-modules are classified by representations of the finite central kernel of the simply connected cover, yielding an equivalence of tensor categories. For a general linear group, every invariant $D$-module is obtained by pullback along the determinant map, reducing the classification to the one-dimensional torus case and inducing a tensor equivalence with the corresponding invariant category on the torus.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>I investigate structural limitations of Presburger-arithmetic-based approaches to the Collatz problem. I show that the Collatz cycle equation admits a unique solution in the $2$-adic integers, which I term a \emph{ghost cycle}. These ghost cycles are shown to be genuine periodic orbits of the $2$-adic Collatz map, satisfying all local parity constraints. I prove unconditionally that the divisibility predicate $\mathcal{D}_y = \{(x, C) \in \mathbb{N}^2: (2^x - 3^y) \mid C\}$, which acts as the algebraic necessary condition for integrality, is not semilinear for any fixed number of odd steps $y \ge 1$. This result is established by demonstrating that the fibers of $\mathcal{D}_y$ exhibit unbounded periods, an obstruction to Presburger definability. Consequently, strategies relying solely on Presburger arithmetic or finite automata to define the integrality constraint cannot capture the distinction between ghost cycles and genuine integer cycles. I conclude with a heuristic argument suggesting that because ghost cycles satisfy the algebraic cycle equation, the non-existence of integer cycles cannot be proven solely through algebraic manipulation of the cycle equation itself.</p></details>

For any prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $\mathcal{O}$, we obtain its higher $α$-Wieferich property, which implies a nonexistence theorem for higher Wieferich unramified prime ideals. If $β\in\mathcal{O}$ is relatively prime to $α$ and all prime ideal factors of $(β)$ are unramified and have residue degree $1$, we apply our higher $α$-Wieferich property to establish the asymptotic equidistribution of digits in $β$-adic expansions of $α^n$, which is a generalization of the Dupuy-Weirich theorem. When $(β)$ have ramified prime ideal factors, we also obtain a result on the block complexity of $β$-adic expansions of $α^n$.</p></details>

Let $f(x)\in K_0[x]$ be a degree $n$ monic polynomial without repeated roots, and $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ a smooth projective model of the affine curve $y^d=f(x)$. Let $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$ be the Jacobian of the $K_0$-curve $\mathcal{C}_{f,d} $. As usual, we identify $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ with its canonical image in $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$ (such that the only ``infinite point'' of $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ goes to the zero of the group law on $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$). We say that an integer $m>1$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K_0$ if there exists a polynomial $f(x)$ as above such that $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}(K_0)$ contains a torsion point of order $m$. Let us put $\ell_0:=[(n+d)/d], \ m_0:=\ell_0 d$. Earlier we proved that if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable, then either $m=d$ or $m = n$ or $m \ge m_0$ (in addition, both $d$ and $n$ are $(n,d)$-reachable over every $K_0$). We also proved that if $m_0$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over some $K_0$ then $n-m_0+\ell_0\ge 0$. In the present paper we discuss the $(n,d)$-reachability of $m_0$ when $n-m_0+\ell_0=0$ or $1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An ideal setting to exhibit infinite sets of primes $p$ relative to which an integer is a primitive root $\pmod p$ is provided by the Bézout subdomain $\widetilde{\mathbb{B}}:=\mathbb{Z}^{\mathbb{P}}/\mathfrak{U}$ of the valuation domain $\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}=\prod_{\mathfrak{U}} \mathbb{Z}_p$ with respect to a nonprincipal ultrafilter $\mathfrak{U}$ on $\mathbb{P}$, extant via Chebotarev's theorem and the ultrafilter theorem and such that the relative algebraic closure $\mathbb{L}:=\mathrm{Abs}(\widetilde{\mathbb{Q}})$ of the prime field of the valued field $\widetilde{\mathbb{Q}}=\prod_{\mathfrak{U}} \mathbb{Q}_p$ contains $\sqrt{-\tilde p}$ for $p\in\mathbb{P}$, contains no $\sqrt[3]{\tilde q}$ for $q\in\mathbb{P}$, and has $\mathrm{tor}(\mathbb{L}^\times)=\langle ζ_6\rangle$. Results include positive resolutions of the conjectured infinitude of primes $p$ for which (i) $\frac{p-1}{6}$ is prime and (ii) a non-perfect-square $-1\neq m\in\mathbb{Z}$ is a primitive root $\pmod p$, establishing as manifest the efficacy of ultraproduct treatments in resolving number theory problems requiring certification of countably infinite conforming sets. Furthermore, we extend these results to the quantitative regime by identifying the primitive-root indicator as a projection in the $C^\ast$-algebra $\ell^\infty(\mathbb{P})$. We prove that the Bézout rigidity of $\widetilde{\mathbb{B}}$ and the $\mathbf{\tildeν}$-anchor enforce the normality of the density state, thereby algebraically precluding ``spectral leakage'' into the infinite tail of Kummer obstructions. This provides a structural, GRH-free proof that the natural density exists as the vacuum expectation value in a GNS representation: $δ_m=ω_δ(f_m)= c_m\prod_{q\in\mathbb{P}}(1-\frac{1}{q(q-1)})$ where $\prod_{q\in\mathbb{P}}(1-\frac{1}{q(q-1)})$ is the Artin Euler product.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $π$ and $π'$ be unitary cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}(n)$ and $\mathrm{GL}(n')$ over a number field $F$. We establish a new zero-free region for all $\mathrm{GL}(1)$-twists of the Rankin-Selberg $L$-function $L(s,π\timesπ')$, generalizing Tatuzawa's refinement of Siegel's work on Dirichlet $L$-functions. As a corollary, we show that for all $\varepsilon>0$, there exists an effectively computable constant $c>0$ depending only on $(n,n',[F:\mathbb{Q}],\varepsilon)$ such that $L(s,π\timesπ')$ has at most one zero (necessarily simple) in the region $$ \mathrm{Re}(s)\geq 1-c/(C(π)C(π')(|\mathrm{Im}(s)|+1))^{\varepsilon}, $$ where $C(π)$ and $C(π')$ are the analytic conductors. A crucial component of our proof is a new standard zero-free region for any twist of $L(s,π\times\widetildeπ)$ by an idele class character $χ$ apart from a possible single exceptional zero (necessarily real and simple) that can occur only when $π\otimesχ^2=π$. This extends earlier work of Humphries and Thorner.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define an $f$-restricted partition $p_f(n,k)$ of fixed length $k$ given by the bivariate generating series \begin{align*} Q_f(z,u) \coloneqq 1+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} p_f(n,k) u^kz^n =\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}(1+uz^k)^{Δ_f(k)}, \end{align*} where $Δ_f(n)=f(n+1)-f(n)$. In this article, we establish a central limit theorem for the number of summands in such partitions when $f(n)=σ_r(n)$ denotes the generalised divisor function, defined as $σ_r(n)=\sum_{d|n}d^r$ for integer $r\geq 2$. This can be considered as a generalisation of the work of Lipnik, Madritsch, and Tichy, who previously studied this problem for $f(n)=\lfloor{n}^α\rfloor$ with $0<α<1$. A key element of our proof relies on the analytic behaviour of the Dirichlet series \begin{align*} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{σ_r(n+1)}{n^s}, \end{align*} for $\mathrm{Re}(s)>1$. We study this problem employing the identity involving the Ramanujan sum. Furthermore, we analyse the Euler product arising from the above Dirichlet series by adopting the argument of Alkan, Ledoan and Zaharescu.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we compute the multiplicities appearing in the ${\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell}$-modular theta correspondence in type II over a non-archimedean field $\mathrm{F}$, where $\ell$ is a prime not dividing the residue cardinality of $\mathrm{F}$. Unlike for representations with complex coefficients, highly non-trivial multiplicities can emerge. We show that these multiplicities are precisely governed by the action of symmetric groups on the set of partial permutations, and the ${\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell}$-representation of symmetric groups these give rise to. The problem is thus reduced to certain branching problems in the modular representation theory of symmetric groups. In particular, if $d$ is the order of the residue cardinality of $\mathrm{F}$ in ${\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell}$, and the rank of the involved general linear groups is bounded above by $ d\ell$, the behavior of the theta correspondence can be predicted via explicit algorithms coming from Pieri's Formula.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve and $p$ an odd prime. In 1991 Kolyvagin conjectured that the system of cohomology classes for torsion quotients of the $p$-adic Tate module of $E$ derived from Heegner points over ring class fields of a suitable imaginary quadratic field $K$ (i.e., the Heegner point Kolyvagin system of $E/K$) is non-trivial. In this paper we prove Kolyvagin's conjecture when $p$ is a prime of good ordinary reduction for $E$ that splits in $K$. In particular, our results cover many cases where $p$ is an Eisenstein prime for $E$, complementing Wei Zhang's earlier results on the conjecture by a different approach. Our methods also yield a proof of a refinement of Kolyvagin's conjecture expressing the divisibility index of the Heegner point Kolyvagin system in terms of the Tamagawa numbers of $E$, as conjectured by Wei Zhang in 2014, as well as proofs of analogous results for the Kolyvagin system obtained from Kato's Euler system.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that any symplectic singularity lying on a smoothable projective symplectic variety locally admits a good action of an algebraic torus of dimension $r \geq 1$, which is canonical. Under mild assumptions, $r=1$ is also confirmed. In particular, it admits (canonical) good $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This proves Kaledin's conjecture conditionally but in a substantially stronger form. Our key idea is to use Donaldson-Sun theory on local Kahler metrics in complex differential geometry to connect with the theory of Poisson deformations of symplectic varieties. For general symplectic singularities, we prove the same assertion -- namely, the existence of a canonical (local) torus action -- assuming that the Donaldson-Sun theory extends to such singularities along with suitable singular (hyper)Kahler metrics. Conversely, our results can be also used to study local behaviour of such metrics around the germ. For instance, we show that such singular hyperKahler metric around isolated singularity is close to a metric cone in a polynomial order, and satisfies $r=1$ i.e., has a good canonical (local) $\mathbb{C}^*$-action, as the complexification of the cone metric rescaling. Our theory also fits well to singularities on many hyperKahler reductions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is concerned with a non-compact GIT quotient of a vector space, in the presence of an abelian group action and an equivariant regular function (potential) on the quotient. We define virtual counts of quasimaps from prestable curves to the critical locus of the potential, and prove a gluing formula in the formalism of cohomological field theories. The main examples studied in this paper is when the above setting arises from quivers with potentials, where the above construction gives quantum correction to the equivariant Chow homology of the critical locus. Following similar ideas as in quasimaps to Nakajima quiver varieties studied by the Okounkov school, we analyse vertex functions in several examples, including Hilbert schemes of points on $\mathbb{C}^3$, moduli spaces of perverse coherent systems on the resolved conifold, and a quiver which defines higher $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-spin chains. Bethe equations are calculated in these cases. The construction in the present paper is based on the theory of gauged linear sigma models as well as shifted symplectic geometry of Pantev, Toën, Vaquie and Vezzosi, and uses the virtual pullback formalism of symmetric obstruction theory of Park, which arises from the recent development of Donaldson-Thomas theory of Calabi-Yau 4-folds.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study congruences relating Fourier coefficients of meromorphic modular forms and Frobenius eigenvalues of elliptic curves corresponding to their poles. We develop a $p$-adic cohomological framework that interprets these congruences via the interaction between the rigid cohomology of modular curves and the crystalline structure of the associated elliptic curves. Using comparison theorems and the Gysin sequence, we relate the Frobenius actions in cohomology to the $U_p$-operator acting on spaces of overconvergent modular forms. Our approach applies uniformly to both modular curves and Shimura curves admitting smooth integral models over $\mathbb{Z}_p$.</p></details>

Our main result is a complete vanishing theorem: for any $n \ge 1$ and $n$ infinite-dimensional irreducible admissible representations $π_1,\dots,π_n$ of $G$, $$ \mathrm{Hom}_G(π_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes π_n, \mathbb{1}) = 0. $$ A refined version holds for $B^+ := \begin{pmatrix} p^{\mathbb{Z}} & \mathbb{Q}_p \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$-invariant forms when at least one $π_i$ is supersingular.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix $n$ a positive integer. Take the $n$-th metallic number $φ_n=\frac{n+\sqrt{n^2+4}}{2}$ (e.g. $φ_1$ is the golden number) and let $Φ_n(q)$ be its $q$-deformation in the sense of S. Morier-Genoud and V. Ovsienko. This is an algebraic continued fraction which admits an expansion into a Taylor series around $q=0$, with integral coefficients. By using the notion of Hankel continued fraction introduced by the first author in 2016 we determine explicitly the first $n+2$ sequences of shifted Hankel determinants of $Φ_n$ and show that they satisfy the following properties: 1) They are periodic and consist of $-1,0,1$ only. 2) They satisfy a three-term Gale-Robinson recurrence, i.e. they form discrete integrable dynamical systems. 3) They are all completely determined by the first sequence. This article thus validates a conjecture formulated by V. Ovsienko and the second author in a recent paper and establishes new connections between $q$-deformations of real numbers and sequences of Catalan or Motzkin numbers.</p></details>

In this paper, we focus on optimal examples in the conjecture and how we find them algorithmically

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we present a conjecture on the construction of generalised elliptic units above number fields with exactly one complex place. These elliptic units obtained as values of multiple elliptic Gamma functions. These form a collection of multivariate meromorphic functions which were studied in the late 1990s and early 2000s in mathematical physics. Our construction extends the scheme of a recent article by Bergeron, Charollois and García where they constructed conjectural elliptic units above complex cubic fields using the elliptic Gamma function. The elliptic units we construct are expected to generate specific abelian extensions of the base field where they are evaluated, thus giving a conjectural solution to Hilbert's 12th problem for the number fields with exactly one complex place. We provide several examples to support our conjecture in optimal cases for cubic, quartic and quintic fields.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Final version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a new construction of $p$-adic heights on varieties over number fields using $p$-adic Arakelov theory. In analogy with Zhang's construction of real-valued heights in terms of adelic metrics, these heights are given in terms of $p$-adic adelic metrics on line bundles. In particular, we describe a construction of canonical $p$-adic heights on abelian varieties and we show that we recover the canonical Mazur--Tate height and, for Jacobians, the height constructed by Coleman and Gross. Our main application is a new and simplified approach to the Quadratic Chabauty method for the computation of rational points on certain curves over the rationals, by pulling back the canonical height on the Jacobian with respect to a carefully chosen line bundle. We show that our construction allows us to reprove, without using $p$-adic Hodge theory or arithmetic fundamental groups, several results due to Balakrishnan and Dogra. Our method also extends to primes $p$ of bad reduction. One consequence of our work is that for any canonical height ($p$-adic or $\mathbb{R}$-valued) on an abelian variety (and hence on pull-backs to other varieties), the local contribution at a finite prime $q$ can be constructed using $q$-analytic methods.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the distance from quadratic irrational numbers to the middle-third Cantor set $C$. Mahler asked whether $C$ contains any irrational algebraic numbers; this remains open even for quadratic irrationals. Rather than assuming an answer to this problem, we obtain uniform lower bounds for the distance from a quadratic irrational $α$ to $C$ in terms of the height $H$ of the minimal polynomial of $α$. We encode $α$ by its orbit under the map $x \mapsto 3x \bmod 1$ and define the exit time $\mathrm{exit}(α)$ as the first iterate that enters the middle interval $[1/3,2/3]$. Our main unconditional result is a quadratic exit bound $\mathrm{exit}(α) \le A (\log_3 H)^2 + B$ for absolute constants $A,B > 0$, valid for all quadratic irrationals whose orbit stays a fixed small distance away from the coarse Cantor boundaries. As a consequence we obtain a distance lower bound $\mathrm{dist}(α,C) \ge H^{-κ\log H}$ for some constant $κ> 0$. On the dynamical side we classify orbits by an $L/M/R$ coding and prove that the total number of visits to the right interval $[2/3,1)$ is $O(\log H)$. A finite case analysis on a bounded portion of the orbit is reduced to checking a finite list of explicit affine inequalities on subintervals of $[0,1]$, which we verify with short computer scripts; all Diophantine and dynamical estimates are proved by hand.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The problem of solving non-linear equations would be considerably simplified by a possibility to convert known solutions into the new ones. This could seem an element of art, but in the context of ADHM-like equations describing quiver varieties there is a systematic approach. In this note we study moduli spaces and dualities of quiver gauge theories associated to effective dynamics of D-branes compactified on Calabi-Yau resolutions. We concentrate on a subfamily of quivers $\mathfrak{Q}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ covering Dynkin diagrams for simple Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$, where the respective BPS algebra is expected to be the Yangian algebra $Y(\mathfrak{g})$. For Yangians labeled by quivers their representations are described by solutions of ADHM-like equations. As quivers substitute Dynkin diagrams a generalization of the Weyl group $\mathcal{W}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ acts on the ADHM solutions. Here we work with the case $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$ and treat this group as a group of electro-magnetic Seiberg-like dualities (we call them Weyl mutations) on the respective quiver gauge theories. We lift it to the case of higher representations associated to rectangular Young diagrams. An action of Weyl mutations on the BPS Yangian algebra is also discussed.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let W be a Weyl group. We can define the notion of positivity of a W-module in terms of the corresponding module over the asymptotic Iwahori-Hecke algebra. We state a conjecture which says that certain explicit W-modules are positive and we prove it in the case where W is of classical type.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a locally compact abelian group with Haar measure $μ$. For integers $n \geq 2$ and $H \geq 2$ and for any $n$-tuples $\mathbf{u}_1,\ldots, \mathbf{u}_H \in \mathbf{N}^n$, there exist measurable subsets $A_1,\ldots, A_n$ of $G$ such that the $n$-tuple $\left( μ(hA_1),\ldots, μ(hA_n) \right)$ has the same relative order as the $n$-tuple $\mathbf{u}_h$ for all $h = 1,\ldots, H$. For integers $m_{i,h}$ for $i =1,\ldots, n-1$ and $h = 1,\ldots, H$, there are Lebesgue measurable sets $A_1,\ldots, A_n$ in $\mathbf{R}$ such that $μ(hA_{i+1}) - μ(hA_i) = m_{i,h}$ for all $i$ and $h$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the problem of determining which integer polynomials divide Newman polynomials. In this vein, we first give results concerning the $8438$ known polynomials with Mahler measure less than $1.3$. We then exhibit a list of polynomials that divide no Newman polynomial. In particular, we show that a degree-10 polynomial of Mahler measure \text{approximately} 1.419404632 divides no Newman polynomial, thereby improving the best known upper bound for any universal constant $σ$, if it exists, such that every integer polynomial of Mahler measure less than $σ$ divides a Newman polynomial. Finally, letting $l(x)$ denote Lehmer's polynomial, we explicitly construct Newman polynomials divisible by $l(x)^2$ with degrees up to $150$, and show that no Newman polynomial is divisible by $l(x)^3$ up to degree $160$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The solvability of Diophantine quartic equations is a contemporary area of interest due to its connection with \textit{generalized Fermat's equation}. In this work, we are interested in the integer solutions of a similar quartic equation $pu^{2} = v^{2}+w^{2}$. For a particular form of $u,v$, and $w$, we prove that the elliptic curves $E_p: y^2 = x(x-1)(x+p^2)$, for primes $p \equiv 1 \pmod{8}$ where $q = (p^2+1)/2$ is also prime, exhibit a sharp dichotomy based on the solution of the aforementioned Diophantine equation: either $\mathrm{rank}(E_p(\mathbb{Q})) = 2$ with trivial Shafarevich-Tate group or $\mathrm{rank} = 0$ with $\Sha(E_p/\mathbb{Q})[2] \cong (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Enrico Bombieri showed conditionally (1994) that the ABC conjecture implies Roth's theorem, and Van Frankenhuysen (1999) later provided a complete proof. Building on Bombieri's and Van der Poorten's explicit formula for continued-fraction coefficients of algebraic numbers (specialized to cubic roots) we derive an effective bound for a Roth-type constant assuming an effective form of ABC. Roth's original argument establishes existence but does not yield an explicit value; our approach makes the dependence on the ABC parameters explicit and also gives an explicit bound in the corresponding special case of Ridout's theorem. We then introduce the notion of approximation gain as a refinement of the quality of an abc-triple. For c in a large computational range, the approximation gain remains below a strikingly small threshold, motivating the conjecture that the approximation gain is always smaller than 1.5. This suggests a potential strategy for attacking ABC by bounding approximation gain and power gain separately.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use composition of binary quadratic forms to systematically create pairs of Seifert surfaces that are non-isotopic in the four-ball. Our main topological result employs Gauss composition to classify the pairs of binary quadratic forms that arise as the Seifert forms of pairs of disjoint Seifert surfaces of genus one. The main ingredient of the proof is number-theoretic and of independent interest. It establishes a new connection between the Bhargava cube and the geometric approach to Gauss composition via planes in the space of two-by-two matrices. In particular, we obtain a geometric recipe that given any two binary quadratic forms finds a Bhargava cube that gives rise to their composition.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Densuke Shiraishi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 24 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the present paper, we provide an algebraic and geometric proof of the Landen formula for complex multiple polylogarithms originally established by Okuda and Ueno. Our approach employs a chain rule of complex KZ solutions arising from the symmetry $z \mapsto \frac{z}{z-1}$ of $\mathbb{P}^1 \backslash \{0,1,\infty\}$. Furthermore, by replacing complex KZ solutions with $\ell$-adic Galois 1-cocycles in this proof, we obtain the Landen formula for $\ell$-adic Galois multiple polylogarithms. This formula involves lower weight terms specific to the $\ell$-adic Galois setting, which originate from the higher-order terms of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff sum ${\rm log}({\rm exp}(-e_1){\rm exp}(-e_0))$. These lower weight terms are explicitly described by an integral involving Goldberg polynomials.</p></details>
