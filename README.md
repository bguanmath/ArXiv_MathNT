In the case of punctured sphere I present an explicit description relating the cohomology rings to the Hilbert scheme of $\mathbb{C}^2$, refining conjectures of Hausel-Letellier-Rodriguez-Villegas and Chuang-Diaconescu-Donagi-Pantev. I explain how the general case should be related to the symplectic geometry of the Hilbert scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, submitted to proceedings of ECM 2024, comments are welcome</p></details> |

Nathanson | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is an open problem in additive number theory to compute and understand the full range of sumset sizes of finite sets of integers, that is, the set $\mathcal{R}_{\mathbf{Z}}(h,k)= \{|hA|:A \subseteq {\mathbf{Z}} \text{ and } |A|=k\}$ for all integers $h \geq 3$ and $k \geq 3$.

A longstanding folklore conjecture asserts that the only solutions are the ``trivial'' ones with $y=-1$. We confirm the conjecture unconditionally for $p\leq 13$, and prove the conjecture holds for $p>1831$ through a careful application of lower bounds for linear forms in two logarithms. We also show that any ``nontrivial'' solution must satisfy $y > 10^{1000}$. In addition, we establish auxiliary results that may support future progress on the problem, and we revisit prior claims in the literature regarding unresolved cases of the equation.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages.

Specifically, we address the factorization in two distinct settings determined by the order of vanishing of associated $L$-unctions at their central critical values-namely, the rank (1,1) and rank (0,2) cases. Our results generalize the algebraic factorization framework developed by B\"{u}y\"{u}kboduk et al. in higher rank scenario to the setting of real quadratic fields. Notably, our work yields the first known factorization result in the higher rank (0,2) case, marking a significant advancement in the study of triple product motives over totally real fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, some minor changes</p></details> |

Using the generating function for this sequence, one can construct sequences of quasimodular forms of all nonnegative integer weights with minimal input: a weight 1 modular form and a power series $F(X)$. Using the weight 1 form $\theta(q)^2$ and $F(X)=e^{X/2}$, we obtain a sequence $\{Y_n(q)\}$ of weight $n$ quasimodular forms on $\Gamma_0(4)$ whose symmetric function avatars $\widetilde{Y}_n(\pmb{x}^k)$ are the symmetric polynomials $T_n(\pmb{x}^k)$ that arise naturally in the study of syzygies of numerical semigroups. With this information, we settle two conjectures about the $T_n(\pmb{x}^k).$ Finally, we note that these polynomials are systematically given in terms of the Borel-Hirzebruch $\widehat{A}$-genus for spin manifolds, where one identifies power sum symmetric functions $p_i$ with Pontryagin classes.</p></details> | 14 pages |

We verify the asymptotic behavior predicted by Gundlach's version of Malle's conjecture.

In 2004, Greg Martin conjectured that as a sequence in $N$, $\dim S_2^{\text{new}}(N)$ takes on all possible natural numbers. In this paper, we investigate several generalizations and variations of this type of problem. In each case, we provide a complete characterization of when such a property holds.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Our approach is based on the disoriented skein category, which we define as a module category over the framed HOMFLYPT skein category. The disoriented skein category admits full incarnation functors to the categories of modules over the iquantum enveloping algebras corresponding to the quantum symmetric pairs, and it can be viewed as an interpolating category for these categories of modules. We define an equivalence of module categories between the disoriented skein category and the iquantum Brauer category (also known as the $q$-Brauer category), after endowing the latter with the structure of a module category over the framed HOMFLYPT skein category. The disoriented skein category has some advantages over the iquantum Brauer category, possessing duality structure and allowing the incarnation functors to be strict morphisms of module categories. Finally, we construct explicit bases for the morphism spaces of the disoriented skein and iquantum Brauer categories.</p></details> | 38 pages |
| 2025-07-16 | **[Base change of (Gorenstein) transpose, k-torsionfree modules, and quasi-faithfully flat extensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12219v1)** | Jian Liu | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Let $\varphi\colon R \rightarrow A$ be a finite ring homomorphism, where $R$ is a two-sided Noetherian ring, and let $M$ be a finitely generated left $A$-module. Under suitable homological conditions on $A$ over $R$, we establish a close relationship between the classical transpose of $M$ over $A$ and the Gorenstein transpose of a certain syzygy module of $M$ over $R$. As an application, for each integer $k>0$, we provide a sufficient condition under which $M$ is $k$-torsionfree over $A$ if and only if a certain syzygy of $M$ over $R$ is $k$-torsionfree over $R$, extending a result of Zhao. We introduce the notion of quasi-faithfully flat extensions and show that, under suitable assumptions, the extension closedness of the category of $k$-torsionfree modules over $R$ is equivalent to that over $A$. An application is an affirmative answer to a question posed by Zhao concerning quasi $k$-Gorensteiness, in the case where both $R$ and $A$ are Noetherian algebras. Finally, when $\varphi$ is a separable split Frobenius extension, it is proved that the category of $k$-torsionfree $R$-modules has finite representation type if and only if the same holds over $A$, with applications to skew group rings.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages.

| 2025-07-16 | **[Classical interpolation categories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12216v1)** | Nate Harman et al. | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study tensor categories that interpolate the representation categories of finite classical groups. There are (at least) two ways to approach these categories: via ultraproducts and via oligomorphic groups. Both have strengths and weaknesses. The ultraproduct categories are easy to define, but their structure is not clear. On the other hand, the oligomorphic approach requires a certain kind of measure as an input, and the space of measures is not obvious. Furthermore, it is not a priori clear that the two approaches yield the same categories in general. We handle all of these issues: we determine all measures on the oligomorphic groups, and we show that the oligomorphic and ultraproduct categories agree, which gives us basic structural results about the latter. Our results rely upon (and in some sense repackage) enumerative results in finite geometry.</p></details> | 68 pages |

In particular, we obtain nontrivial estimates of exponential sums with such sequences.</p></details> |  |

Over a period of decades the transition measure turned out to be an invaluable tool for many problems of the asymptotic representation theory of the symmetric groups. Kerov also showed how to expand this notion for a wider class of continual diagrams so that the transition measure provides a homeomorphism between a subclass of continual diagrams (having a specific support) and a class of centered probability measures with a support contained in a specific interval. We quantify the modulus of continuity of this homeomorphism. More specifically, we study the dependence of the cumulative distribution function of Kerov transition measure on the profile of a diagram at the locations where the profile is not too steep.</p></details> | <details><summary>versi...</summary><p>version 3 is nearly identical to the published paper</p></details> |

Maji and T. Sarkar regarding the location of zeros of a two-parameter family of reciprocal polynomials, $R_{k,\ell}(z)$ for positive integers $k$ and $\ell$. These polynomials are generalizations of Ramanujan polynomials studied by M. R. Murty, C. Smyth, and R. Wang. More specifically, we show that except for two real zeros, all other zeros of $R_{k,\ell}(z)$ lie on the unit circle.</p></details> |  |

We focus mainly on actions that are finitely generated, and the key tool in our analysis is a decomposition result for any bounded measurable function into a sum of two components, one that mimics concentration properties of pretentious multiplicative functions and another that mimics vanishing properties of aperiodic multiplicative functions. Crucial to part of our arguments are some new seminorms that are defined by a mixture of addition and multiplication of the iterates of the action, and we prove an inverse theorem that explicitly characterizes the factor of the system on which these seminorms vanish.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, small changes made</p></details> |

We prove that $u(n)$ satisfies the higher order Tur\'{a}n inequalities for $n\geq33$ and that certain second $j$-shifted difference of $u(n)$ are positive.</p></details> |  |
| 2025-07-16 | **[Small gaps between almost-twin primes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00748v2)** | Bin Chen | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ be large. We show that there exist infinitely many primes $q_{1}< \cdot\cdot\cdot < q_{m+1}$ such that \[ q_{m+1}-q_{1}=O(e^{7.63m}) \] and $q_{j}+2$ has at most \[ \frac{7.36m}{\log 2} + \frac{4\log m}{\log 2} + 21 \] prime factors for each $1 \leq j \leq m+1$. This improves the previous result of Li and Pan, replacing $m^{4}e^{8m}$ by $e^{7.63m}$ and $\frac{16m}{\log 2} + \frac{5\log m}{\log 2} + 37$ by $\frac{7.36m}{\log 2} + \frac{4\log m}{\log 2} + 21$. The main inputs are the Maynard-Tao sieve, a minorant for the indicator function of the primes constructed by Baker and Irving, for which a stronger equidistribution theorem in arithmetic progressions to smooth moduli is applicable, and Tao's approach previously used to estimate $\sum_{x \leq n < 2x} \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{P}}(n)\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{P}}(n+12)\omega_{n}$, where $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{P}}$ stands for the characteristic function of the primes and $\omega_{n}$ are multidimensional sieve weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages.

| 2025-07-16 | **[Approximation of L-functions associated to Hecke cusp eigenforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08608v2)** | An Huang et al. | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We derive a family of approximations for L-functions of Hecke cusp eigenforms, according to a recipe first described by Matiyasevich for the Riemann xi function. We show that these approximations converge to the true L-function and point out the role of an equidistributional notion in ensuring the approximation is well-defined, and along the way we demonstrate error formulas which may be used to investigate analytic properties of the L-function and its derivatives, such as the locations and orders of zeros. Together with the Euler product expansion of the L-function, the family of approximations also encodes some of the key features of the L-function such as its functional equation. As an example, we apply this method to the L-function of the modular discriminant and demonstrate that the approximation successfully locates zeros of the L-function on the critical line. Finally, we derive via Mellin transforms a convolution-type formula which leads to precise error bounds in terms of the incomplete gamma function. This formula can be interpreted as an alternative definition for the approximation and sheds light on Matiyasevich's procedure.</p></details> | 17 pages |

We show that a finite subset of integers $S$ that does not contain any perfect $q^{th}$ power, contains a $q^{th}$ power residue modulo almost every natural numbers $N$ with at most $k$ prime factors if and only if $S$ corresponds to a $k$-blocking set of $\PG(\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n})$. Here, $n$ is the number of distinct primes that divides the $q$-free parts of elements of $S$. Consequently, this geometric connection enables us to utilize methods from Galois geometry to derive lower bounds for the cardinalities of such sets $S$ and to completely characterize such $S$ of the smallest and the second smallest cardinalities. Furthermore, the property of whether a finite subset of integers contains a $q^{th}$ power residue modulo almost every integer $N$ with at most $k$ prime factors is invariant under the action of projective general linear group $\mathrm{PGL}(n, q)$.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in Acta Arithmetica</p></details> |

The geometric counterpart is the notion of a Henselian scheme, which is an analogue of a tubular neighborhood in algebraic geometry. In this paper we revisit the foundations of the theory of Henselian schemes. The pathological behavior of quasi-coherent sheaves on Henselian schemes in characteristic 0 makes them poor models for an "algebraic tube" in characteristic 0. We show that such problems do not arise in positive characteristic, and establish good properties for analogues of smooth and \'etale maps in the general Henselian setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>v4: 5...</summary><p>v4: 57 pages (including appendix). clarified and improved some proofs based on referee report, especially section 5.3</p></details> |
| 2025-07-15 | **[On the arithmetic average of the first $n$ primes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04951v3)** | Matt Visser | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The arithmetic average of the first $n$ primes, $\bar p_n = {1\over n} \sum_{i=1}^n p_i$, exhibits very many interesting and subtle properties. Since the transformation from $p_n \to \bar p_n$ is extremely easy to invert, $p_n = n\bar p_n - (n-1)\bar p_{n-1}$, it is clear that these two sequences $p_n \longleftrightarrow \bar p_n$ must ultimately carry exactly the same information. But the averaged sequence $\bar p_n$, while very closely correlated with the primes, ($\bar p_n \sim {1\over2} p_n$), is much "smoother'', and much better behaved. Using extensions of various standard results I shall demonstrate that the prime-averaged sequence $\bar p_n$ satisfies prime-averaged analogues of the Cramer, Andrica, Legendre, Oppermann, Brocard, Fourges, Firoozbakht, Nicholson, and Farhadian conjectures. (So these prime-averaged analogues are not conjectures, they are theorems.) The crucial key to enabling this pleasant behaviour is the "smoothing'' process inherent in averaging. Whereas the asymptotic behaviour of the two sequences is very closely correlated the local fluctuations are quite different.</p></details> | <details><summary>V1: 1...</summary><p>V1: 10 pages.

These functions form a basis of the space of unimodular invariant valuations. We show that, in even dimensions, these functions are in fact simultaneous symplectic Hecke eigenfunctions. We leverage this and apply the theory of spherical functions and their associated zeta functions to prove analytic, asymptotic, and combinatorial results about the arithmetic functions averaging $\ell$th Ehrhart coefficients.</p></details> | 28 pages |
| 2025-07-15 | **[Depth one part of Tannakian groups of filtrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11717v1)** | Payman Eskandari | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Let $(F_r M)_{r\in\mathbb{Z}}$ be a finite filtration on an object $M$ of a neutral Tannakian category $\mathbf{T}$ in characteristic zero. Let $u(M)=u^F(M)$ be the Lie algebra of the subgroup of the Tannakian fundamental group of $M$ that acts trivially on the associated graded $Gr^FM$. The filtration $F_\bullet M$ induces a filtration on the internal Hom $\underline{Hom}(M,M)$, which in turn induces a filtration $F_\bullet u(M)$ on $u(M)$. This filtration on $u(M)$ is concentrated in negative degrees. In this paper, we give a description of the graded piece $Gr^F_{-1}u( M)$ in terms of the extensions $F_{r+1}M/F_{r-1}M\in Ext^1(Gr^F_{r+1}M, Gr^F_{r}M)$. In particular, these extensions determine $Gr^F_{-1}u(M)$. Note that here we neither assume the filtration is functorial, nor we assume that $Gr^FM$ is semisimple. The problem of studying $u(M)$ in this generality is motivated by the desire to understand Tannakian groups associated to a mixed motive and its realizations, including realizations for which semisimplicity of realizations of pure motives is not known and realizations that lack an interesting functorial weight filtration. We also give two related applications. The first is an equivalent condition in the generality described above for when $u(M)$ coincides with its trivial upper bound $F_{-1}\underline{Hom}(M,M)$. This result generalizes earlier criteria for maximality of $u(M)$ obtained by various authors in special contexts or under limiting conditions. In the second application, we apply the results to the setting of a neutral Tannakian category with a functorial weight filtration $W_\bullet$. Combining the constructions of [arXiv:2307.15487] with our general maximality criterion we prove a result about the structure of the set of isomorphism classes of objects $M$ for which $Gr^WM$ is isomorphic to a given graded object $A$ and $u^W(M)=W_{-1}\underline{Hom}(M,M)$.</p></details> | Comments are welcome |
| 2025-07-15 | **[Lower bounds for mask polynomials with many cyclotomic divisors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11672v1)** | Gergely Kiss et al. | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a nonempty set $A \subset \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$, define the mask polynomial $A(X)=\sum_{a\in A} X^a$. Suppose that there are $s_1,\dots,s_k\in\nn\setminus\{1\}$ such that the cyclotomic polynomials $\Phi_{s_1},\dots,\Phi_{s_k}$ divide $A(X)$. What is the smallest possible size of $A$? For $k=1$, this was answered by Lam and Leung in 2000. Less is known about the case when $k\geq 2$; in particular, one may ask whether (similarly to the $k=1$ case) the optimal configurations have a simple ``fibered" structure on each scale involved. We prove that this is true in a number of special cases, but false in general, even if further strong structural assumptions are added. Results of this type are expected to have a broad range of applications, including Favard length of product Cantor sets, Fuglede's spectral set conjecture, and the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture on integer tilings.</p></details> |  |

With $r$ a non negative integer and $n$ and $m$ positive integers we consider the sums \begin{equation*}\mathbf{S}_{r}\left(n,m\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}{\left\lfloor \frac{km}{n}\right\rfloor}^r\end{equation*} While a formula for $\mathbf{S}_1$ is well known, we provide closed-form formulas for $\mathbf{S}_2$ and $\mathbf{S}_3$ as well as the reciprocity laws they satisfy. Additionally, one can find a closed-form formula for the classical Dedekind sum using the Euclidean algorithm. Finally, we provide a general formula for $\mathbf{S}_r$ showing its dependency on generalized Dedekind sums.</p></details> | 13 pages |

For example, $K$ may be a totally imaginary number field or a finite extension of a $p$-adic field. Suppose $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ are forms of degree $d$ over $K.$ Bik, Draisma and Snowden recently proved that there exists a constant $B = B(d,s,K)$ such that the rational solutions to the system of equations $f_1=\ldots=f_s = 0$ are Zariski dense, as long as the Birch rank of $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ is greater than $B.$ We establish an effective bound for this constant. Combined with results of Skinner, we obtain as a corollary a sufficient condition for the integer zeros of a system of forms over a number field to satisfy the Hardy-Littlewood asymptotic with a positive leading term. This corollary generalizes a seminal result proved by Schmidt for the rational numbers.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Bondarko | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study $t$-structures (on triangulated categories) that are closely related to weight structures. A $t$-structure couple $t=(C_{t\le 0},C_{t\ge 0})$ is said to be adjacent to a weight structure $w=(C_{w\le 0}, C_{w\ge 0})$ if $C_{t\ge 0}=C_{w\ge 0}$. For a category $C$ that satisfies the Brown representability property we prove that $t$ that is adjacent to $w$ exists if and only if $w$ is smashing (that is, "respects C-coproducts"). The heart $Ht$ of this $t$ is the category of those functors $Hw^{op}\to Ab$ that respect products (here $Hw$ is the heart of $w$); the result has important applications. We prove several more statements on constructing $t$-structures starting from weight structures; we look for a strictly orthogonal $t$-structure $t$ on some $C'$ (where $C,C'$ are triangulated subcategories of a common $D$) such that $C'_{t\le 0}$ (resp. $C'_{t\ge 0}$) is characterized by the vanishing of morphisms from $C_{w\ge 1}$ (resp. $C_{w\le -1}$). Some of these results generalize properties of semi-orthogonal decompositions proved in the previous paper, and can be applied to various derived categories of (quasi)coherent sheaves on a scheme $X$ that is projective over an affine noetherian one. We also study hearts of orthogonal $t$-structures and their restrictions, and prove some statements on "reconstructing" weight structures from orthogonal $t$-structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Lots ...</summary><p>Lots of minor corrections made; exposition improved. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1907.03686</p></details> |

Balmer and Gallauer's recent result on finite $p$-permutation resolutions of $kG$-modules motivates the study of an intriguing new invariant; the $p$-permutation dimension. Following Walsh's success with cyclic groups of prime order, we compute the (global) $p$-permutation dimension of the Klein 4-group in characteristic $p := 2$, along with the dimensions for each of its indecomposable modules.</p></details> | 20 pages |

We establish this for unramified $R$ granted that $G^{\mathrm{ad}}$ is totally isotropic, that is, has a "maximally transversal" parabolic $R$-subgroup. We also use purity for the Brauer group to reduce the conjecture for unramified $R$ to simply connected $G$--a much less direct such reduction of Panin had been a step in solving the equal characteristic case of Grothendieck-Serre. We base the group-theoretic aspects of our arguments on the geometry of the stack $\mathrm{Bun}_G$, instead of the affine Grassmannian used previously, and we quickly reprove the crucial weak $\mathbb{P}^1$-invariance input: for any reductive group $H$ over a semilocal ring $A$, every $H$-torsor $\mathscr{E}$ on $\mathbb{P}^1_A$ satisfies $\mathscr{E}|_{\{t = 0\}} \simeq \mathscr{E}|_{\{t = \infty\}}$. For the geometric aspects, we develop reembedding and excision techniques for relative curves with finiteness weakened to quasi-finiteness, thus overcoming a known obstacle in mixed characteristic, and show that every generically trivial torsor over $R$ under a totally isotropic $G$ trivializes over every affine open of $\mathrm{Spec}(R) \setminus Z$ for some closed $Z$ of codimension $\ge 2$.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages; final version, to appear in the Journal of the European Mathematical Society</p></details> |

The classical spaces $X$, such as the Lie groups, homogeneous spaces, or more general manifolds, are described by various algebras $A$, defined over various fields $F$. These algebras $A$ satisfy a commutativity type condition, and the general idea is that of lifting this condition, and calling quantum spaces the underlying space-like objects $X$. One problem comes from the fact that different fields $F$ lead, via different algebras $A$, to different classes of quantum spaces $X$. Our aim here is to identify and put at the center of the presentation those quantum spaces $X$ which do not depend on the choice of $F$.</p></details> | <details><summary>400 p...</summary><p>400 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2312.12368, arXiv:2406.03664</p></details> |

Notably, we obtain the optimal bound $\mathbb{P}(A \text{ irreducible}) = 1 -O(1/\sqrt n)$ when we have near-uniformity modulo twelve primes, which notably happens when the $\mu_j$ are uniform over a segment of length $N\ge 10^8.$</p></details> | 18 pages |

This takes the form of a Large Deviation and Central Limit Theorem, including multidimensional results for random vectors.

The description simplifies when either the isotropy groups are FC-hypercentral or $\mathcal G$ is the transformation groupoid $\Gamma\ltimes X$ defined by an action $\Gamma\curvearrowright X$ with locally finite stabilizers. To illustrate the class of C$^*$-algebras for which our results can provide a complete description of the ideal structure, we compute the primitive spectrum of $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb Z)\ltimes C_0(\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb R)/U_3(\mathbb R))$, where $U_3(\mathbb R)$ is the group of unipotent upper triangular matrices.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages; v4: minor corrections and changes in exposition, more references; v3: a discussion of essentially principal groupoids and the ideal intersection property added; v2: minor corrections and improvements, a discussion of type I case added</p></details> |

This paper explores a new problem which arises in applications, that of obtaining conditions for solving the Modular Linear System $Ax=b\rem n$ given $A,b$ in $\zz_n$ for $x$ in $\zz_n$ along with the constraint that the value of the linear function $\phi(x)=\la w,x\ra$ is coprime to $n$ for some solution $x$. In this paper we develop decomposition of the system to coprime moduli $p^{r(p)}$ which are divisors of $n$ and show how such a decomposition simplifies the computation of Smith form. This extends the well known index calculus method of computing the discrete logarithm where the moduli over which the linear system is reduced were assumed to be prime (to solve the reduced systems over prime fields) to the case when the factors of the modulus are prime powers $p^{r(p)}$. It is shown how this problem can be addressed effciently using the invariant factors and Smith form of the augmented matrix $[A,-p^{r(p)}I]$ and conditions modulo $p$ satisfied by $w$, where $p^{r(p)}$ vary over all divisors of $n$ with $p$ prime.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Given the results of an exhaustive search of the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences for such sequences for $m$ up to $6$, we first focus on the case where $m=2$ with our attention mainly paid to the combinatorics of two $2$-convolutive sequences, featuring bijective proofs for both. For other $2$-convolutive sequences discovered in the OEIS, we apply generating function manipulations to show their convolutivity. We also give two examples of $3$-convolutive sequences. Finally, we discuss other convolutive series that are not eta-products.</p></details> | 22 pages |

The study of matchings began in the 1990s and was motivated by a conjecture of E. K. Wakeford on canonical forms for homogeneous polynomials. The theory was later extended to the linear-algebraic setting of vector subspaces over field extensions, and then to matroids. In this paper, we investigate the existence and structure of matchings in both abelian groups and field extensions. Using Dyson's $e$-transform, a tool from additive combinatorics, along with a linear analogue which is introduced in this paper, we establish characterization theorems for matchable sets and subspaces. Several applications are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of these theorems as standalone tools. Throughout, we highlight the parallels between the group-theoretic and linear-algebraic perspectives.</p></details> | 17 pages |

We show that $\mathscr{A}^p_{\varsigma}$ has an initial object such that Daniell integration, Bochner integration, Lebesgue integration, Stone--Weierstrass Approximation Theorem, power series expansion, and Fourier series expansion are morphisms in $\mathscr{A}^p_{\varsigma}$ starting with this initial object.</p></details> | 50 pages, 5 figures |

We show that such a flow induces a piecewise linear one-dimensional $\mathrm{X}$-foliation with two singularities, the unique sink $\mathrm{X}$ and the unique source $\mathrm{X}[1]$. Moreover, we show that evolution flows on cluster complexes are continuous refinement/generalization of green mutations on cluster exchange graphs. For the cluster category of a Dynkin or Euclidean quiver $Q$, we prove that the $\mathrm{X}$-foliation is compact or semi-compact, for various choices of $\mathrm{X}$. As an application, we show that $\mathrm{Cpx}(\mathcal{C})$ is spherical (Dynkin case) or contractible (Euclidean case).

We prove that the commutator $[x,g]$ is a $p$-element for every $g\in G$ if and only if $x$ is central modulo $O_p(G),$ where $O_p(G)$ denotes the largest normal $p$-subgroup of $G$. This result simultaneously generalizes some variants of both the Baer-Suzuki theorem and Glauberman's $Z_p^*$-theorem. Furthermore, we show that if $x\in G$ is a $p$-element and there exists an integer $m\ge 1$ such that for all $g\in G$, either $[x,g]=1$ or the order of $[x,g] $ is $m$ for every $g\in G$, then the subgroup generated by the conjugacy class of $G$ containing $x$ is solvable.

We study the spectra of these operators on finite dimensional representations, and describe them in terms of rational functions with an extra symmetry.

We show that under the assumption of an exceptional character $\chi$ with $L(1,\chi)=o\left((\log D)^{-5}\right)$, for any $q<x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$, the asymptotic $$\psi(x,q,a)=\frac{\psi(x)}{\phi(q)}\left(1-\chi\left(\frac{aD}{(D,q)}\right)+o(1)\right)$$ holds for almost all $a$ with $(a,q)=1$. We also find that for any fixed $a$, the above holds for almost all $q<x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$ with $(a,q)=1$. Previous prime equidistribution results under the assumption of Siegel zeroes (by Friedlander-Iwaniec and the current author) have found that the above asymptotic holds either for all $a$ and $q$ or on average over a range of $q$ (i.e. for the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture), but only under the assumption that $q<x^{\theta}$ where $\theta=\frac{30}{59}$ or $\frac{16}{31}$, respectively.</p></details> |  |

For a positive integer $n$, the polynomial $X^n - 1 \in \mathbb{F}_q[X]$ is termed $3$-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$ if all its irreducible factors in $\mathbb{F}_q[X]$ are either binomials or trinomials. In 2021, Oliveira and Reis characterized all positive integers $n$ for which $X^n - 1$ is 3-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$ when $q = 2$ and $q = 4$. Recently, the author provided a complete characterization for odd $q$. This paper extends the investigation to finite fields of even characteristic, fully determining all $n$ such that $X^n - 1$ is 3-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$ for even $q$.

Karp et al. | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A quasi-exponential is an entire function of the form $e^{cu}p(u)$, where $p(u)$ is a polynomial and $c \in \mathbb{C}$. Let $V = \langle e^{h_1u}p_1(u), \dots, e^{h_Nu}p_N(u) \rangle$ be a vector space with a basis of quasi-exponentials. We show that if $h_1, \dots, h_N$ are nonnegative and all of the complex zeros of the Wronskian $\operatorname{Wr}(V)$ are real, then $V$ is totally nonnegative in the sense that all of its Grassmann-Pl\"{u}cker coordinates defined by the Taylor expansion about $u=t$ are nonnegative, for any real $t$ greater than all of the zeros of $\operatorname{Wr}(V)$. Our proof proceeds by showing that the higher Gaudin Hamiltonians $T_\lambda^G(t)$ introduced in [ALTZ14] are universal Pl\"ucker coordinates about $u=t$ for the Wronski map on spaces of quasi-exponentials. The result that $V$ is totally nonnegative follows from the fact that $T_\lambda^G(t)$ is positive semidefinite, which we establish using partial traces. We also show that if $h_1 = \cdots = h_N = 0$ then $T_\lambda^G(t)$ equals $\beta^\lambda(t)$, which is the universal Pl\"ucker coordinate for the Wronski map on spaces of polynomials introduced in [KP23].</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages. v2: Final version</p></details> |

In particular, we study subseries of the Lambert series $\sum_k 1/(t^k-1)$ and two types of irrationality sequences $(a_k)$ introduced by Paul Erd\H{o}s and Ronald Graham. Next, we address a question of Erd\H{o}s, who asked how rapidly a sequence of positive integers $(a_k)$ can grow if both series $\sum_k 1/a_k$ and $\sum_k 1/(a_k+1)$ have rational sums. Our construction of double exponentially growing sequences $(a_k)$ with this property generalizes to any number $d$ of series $\sum_k 1/(a_k+j)$, $j=0,1,2,\ldots,d-1$, and, in particular, also gives a positive answer to a question of Erd\H{o}s and Ernst Straus on the interior of the set of $d$-tuples of their sums. Finally, we prove the existence of a sequence $(a_k)$ such that all well-defined sums $\sum_k 1/(a_k+t)$, $t\in\mathbb{Z}$, are rational numbers, giving a negative answer to a conjecture by Kenneth Stolarsky.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages. v4: referee's comments are incorporated, a mistake in the proof of Theorem 2.3 is fixed</p></details> |

Griesmer | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>If $A$ and $B$ are subsets of an abelian group, their sumset is $A+B:=\{a+b:a\in A, b\in B\}$. We study sumsets in discrete abelian groups, where at least one summand has positive upper Banach density. Renling Jin proved that if $A$ and $B$ are sets of integers having positive upper Banach density, then $A+B$ is piecewise syndetic. Bergelson, Furstenberg, and Weiss improved the conclusion to "$A+B$ is piecewise Bohr." Beiglb\"ock, Bergelson, and Fish showed this to be qualitatively optimal, in the sense that if $C\subseteq \mathbb Z$ is piecewise Bohr, then there are $A, B\subseteq \mathbb Z$ having positive upper Banach density such that $A+B\subseteq C$. We improve these results by establishing a strong correspondence between sumsets in discrete abelian groups, level sets of convolutions in compact abelian groups, and sumsets in compact abelian groups. Our proofs avoid measure preserving dynamics and nonstandard analysis, and our results apply to discrete abelian groups of any cardinality.</p></details> | 45 pages |

Let $x$ be large, and assume that, for some real number $\tau$, the quantities $r(p)-\Re\{f(p)/p^{i\tau}\}$ are small in various appropriate average senses over the set of prime numbers not exceeding $x$.

A key step in doing so is to provide criteria for all the endomorphisms of $A$ to be defined over $K(A[2])$, the field generated by its 2-torsion. When $K= \mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(A[2])/\mathbb{Q})$ is cyclic of prime order $p = 2 \dim(A) +1$, we prove the somewhat surprising result that there are only finitely many possibilities for the geometric endomorphism algebra $\mathrm{End}(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$.In fact, when $\dim (A) \not \in \{3,5,9,21,33,81\}$, we show $\mathrm{End}(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ is a proper subfield of the $p$-th cyclotomic field.

Morrow | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we relate recent work of Yuan--Zhang and Song on adelic line bundles over quasi-projective arithmetic varieties to recent advances in pluripotential theory on global Berkovich spaces from Pille-Schneider. In particular, we establish an equivalence between subcategories of adelic line bundles on quasi-projective varieties and line bundles on their Berkovich analytifications equipped with a continuous plurisubharmonic metric. We also provide several applications of this equivalence. For example, we generalize a construction of Pille-Schneider concerning families of Monge--Amp\`ere measures on analytifications of projective arithmetic varieties to the quasi-projective setting. With this construction, we offer a new description of non-degenerate subvarieties which involves Monge--Amp\`ere measures over trivially valued fields. Finally, we define a Monge--Amp\`ere measure on the analytification of a quasi-projective arithmetic variety.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages; comments very welcome!</p></details> |

Part I: Extensions of abelian groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10683v2)** | Darius Dramburg et al. | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Let $G \leq \operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ be a non-trivial finite group, acting on $R = \mathbb{C}[x_1, x_2, x_3]$. The resulting skew-group algebra $R \ast G$ is $3$-Calabi-Yau, and can sometimes be endowed with the structure of a $3$-preprojective algebra. However, not every such $R \ast G$ admits such a structure. The finite subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ are classified into types (A) to (L). We consider the groups $G$ of types (C) and (D) and determine for each such group whether the algebra $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective structure. We show that the algebra $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective structure if and only if $9 \mid |G|$. Our proof is constructive and yields a description of the involved $2$-representation infinite algebras. This is based on the semi-direct decomposition $G \simeq N \rtimes K$ for an abelian group $N$, and we show that the existence of a $3$-preprojective structure on $R \ast G$ is essentially determined by the existence of one on $R \ast N$. This provides new classes of $2$-representation infinite algebras, and we discuss some $2$-Auslander-Platzeck-Reiten tilts. Along the way, we give a detailed description of the involved groups and their McKay quivers by iteratively applying skew-group constructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected typos and proof of 4.10(v1).

The group $\mathcal{S}_K$ can be seen as an archimedean counterpart to the group of units $\mathcal{O}_K^\times$ of the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$. If $K=\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal{S}_K)$ is a CM-field then $\mathcal{S}_K/{\mathop{\rm Tor}\nolimits}(K^\times)$ is a free abelian group of infinite rank. If $K=\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal{S}_K)$ is not a CM-field then $\mathcal{S}_K=\{\pm 1\}$. In the former case $\mathcal{S}_K$ is the kernel of the relative norm map from $K^\times$ to the multiplicative subgroup $k^\times$ of the maximal totally real subfield $k$ of $K$.</p></details> |  |

There are descriptions of the space of such polynomials for $g \leq 5$, but for $g=3$, $4$ and $5$, these results contain mistakes. We correct these statements. Our proofs build on a criterion that determines when a real polynomial has only real roots in terms of the non-necessarily distinct roots of its first derivative.</p></details> |  |

Ramirez | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In metric Diophantine approximation, one frequently encounters the problem of showing that a limsup set has positive or full measure. Often it is a set of points in $m$-dimensional Euclidean space, or a set of $n$-by-$m$ systems of linear forms, satisfying some approximation condition infinitely often. The main results of this paper are bootstraps: if one can establish positive measure for such a limsup set in $m$-dimensional Euclidean space, then one can establish positive or full measure for an associated limsup set in the setting of $n$-by-$m$ systems of linear forms. Consequently, a class of $m$-dimensional results in Diophantine approximation can be bootstrapped to corresponding $n$-by-$m$-dimensional results. This leads to short proofs of existing, new, and hypothetical theorems for limsup sets that arise in the theory of systems of linear forms. We present several of these.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages. v2: minor changes. v3: incorporated referee's comments, this version to appear in Trans. Amer. Math.

The result requires the existence of $\lambda$-strongly acyclic representations, which we define and show exists in plenitude for any $\lambda$. The motivation is possible applications to torsion in the cohomology of arithmetic groups, although the connection in this setting is as of yet conjectural.</p></details> | 30 pages |

It is unclear both what the domain of definition of this pairing is, and how to compute it. This paper explores the relavence of the Beilinson--Bloch conjectures to this problem. In particular, it is shown that if $X$ is a smooth projective curve and the Albanese kernel of $X\times X$ is torsion, then there is an algorithm to compute the generalised height pairing on a pair of rational points on the Jacobian. This leads to the consideration of certain `motivic refinements' of the nonabelian cohomology varieties which arise in nonabelian Chabauty.</p></details> | Comments welcome |

Let $E$ be a $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-cp}]$-oriented supersingular elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$. There exists a $c$-isogeny from $E$ to $E^p$ with kernel $G \subset E[c]$. Given an Eichler order corresponding to the endomorphism ring $\text{End}(E,G)=\{ \theta \in \text{End}(E): \theta(G) \subseteq G \}$, we can compute a ternary quadratic form with discriminant $p$ by solving two square roots in $\mathbb{F}_c$, and the ternary quadratic form corresponds to a maximal order $\mathcal{O} \cong \text{End}(E)$ in $B_{p,\infty}$ by Brandt--Sohn correspondence. Let $D$ be a prime with $D<p$ (resp. $4D<p$). If an imaginary quadratic order with discriminant $-D$ (resp. $-4D$) can be embedded into $\text{End}(E)$, then we can compute a maximal order in $B_{p,\infty}$ corresponding to $\text{End}(E)$ by solving one square root in $\mathbb{F}_D$ and two square roots in $\mathbb{F}_c$. As we know, any isogeny between supersingular elliptic curves can be translated into a kernel ideal of the endomorphism ring. We study the action of the kernel ideal and give a basis of its right order. In general, we propose an efficient algorithm for computing a maximal order from an Eichler order in $B_{p,\infty}$.</p></details> | 24 pages |

We then use mean value and second moment formulas in three applications. First, we obtain quantitative estimates for counting primitive $S$-arithmetic lattice points. We next establish a quantitative Khintchine--Groshev theorem, which, in the real case, involves counting primitive integer points in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ subject to congruence conditions.

Our method stems from recent advancements in the uniform Mordell-Lang conjecture, particularly the breakthrough results by Dimitrov, Gao, and Habegger, as well as independent work by K\"uhne and the collaborative effort of Gao, Ge, and K\"uhne.</p></details> |  |

Since $\text{Ver}_4^+$ is a reduction of the category of supervector spaces to characteristic $2$ (by a result of Venkatesh, arXiv:1507.05142), these groups may be viewed as general linear supergroups in characteristic $2$. More precisely, every object in $\text{Ver}_4^+$ has the form $m\mathbf{1}+nP$ where $P$ is the indecomposable projective, and $\text{GL}(m\mathbf{1}+nP)$ is the reduction to characteristic $2$ of $\text{GL}(m+n|n)$. We explicitly describe the irreducible representations of $\text{GL}(P)$ and then use this description to classify the irreducible representations of $\text{GL}(m\mathbf{1}+nP)$ for general $m,n$. We also define some subgroups of $\text{GL}(m\mathbf{1}+nP)$ and classify their irreducible representations. Finally, we conjecture a Steinberg tensor product theorem for $\text{Ver}_4^+$ involving the square of the Frobenius map.</p></details> | 32 pages |
| 2025-07-13 | **[Odd Verma's Theorem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14274v4)** | Shunsuke Hirota | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By applying the exchange property of odd reflections, we describe compositions of homomorphisms between Verma modules associated with different Borel subalgebras that share the same character. As an application, we realize the module category of certain finite-dimensional algebras containing Verma modules, such as the preprojective algebra of type \( A_2 \), as extension-closed abelian subcategories of category \( \mathcal{O} \). This allows us to establish lower bounds on the length of socle of Verma modules in terms of combinatorial invariants of graphs, such as finite Young lattices. In addition, we investigate variants of Verma modules obtained by changing Borel subalgebras. These variants enable us to realize the principal block of \( \mathfrak{gl}(1|1) \) as an extension-closed abelian subcategory of category \( \mathcal{O} \). We further apply the exchange property of odd reflections to refine existing results on the associated varieties and projective dimensions of Verma modules. As explained in our companion manuscript, many of our results extend to the setting of regular symmetrizable Kac Moody Lie superalgebras and Nichols algebras of diagonal type, in view of the Weyl groupoids framework in the sence of Heckenberger and Yamane.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added Theorem 5.23 and rearranged the order of sections</p></details> |

We denote by $S(\mathbf{X}(\mathbb{F}))$ the Schwartz-functions on $\mathbf{X}(\mathbb{F})$. In this paper we offer a new approach on how to obtain bounds on \[\dim_{\mathbb{C}}\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbf{G}(\mathbb{F})}(S(\mathbf{X}(\mathbb{F})),\pi)\]for an irreducible smooth representation $\pi$ of $\mathbf{G}(\mathbb{F})$. Our strategy builds on the theory of $\rho$-derivatives and the Local Structure Theorem for spherical varieties. Currently, we focus on the case of the symplectic Grassmannian and the space of matrices. In particular, we obtain a new proof of Howe duality in type II as well as an explicit description of the local Miyawaki-liftings in the Hilbert-Siegel case. Furthermore, we manage to extend previous results of the author regarding the conservation relation in the theta correspondence to metaplectic covers of symplectic groups. Finally, we use our new proof of Howe duality in type II to relate the order of the poles of Godement-Jacquet $L$-functions to the geometry of the space of matrices and the order of poles of certain intertwining operators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added section relating the results to the behavior of L-functions and intertwining operators</p></details> |

Let $\ell$ be a prime number with $\ell\neq p$. Let $\Gamma$ be a group of automorphisms of $G$ of order $\ell$. Let $\Pi$ be an $\ell$-modular irreducible smooth representation of $G(F)$ which extends as a representation of $G(F)\rtimes \Gamma$. We show that the Jacquet modules of the Tate cohomology groups $\widehat{H}^i(\Gamma, \Pi)$ are sub modules of certain Jacquet modules of $\Pi$. When $\Gamma$ is induced by a Galois automorphism, we use this result on Jacquet modules to show that $\widehat{H}^i(\Gamma, \Pi)$ is a finite length representation. We further use the Jacquet-modules to study some irreducibility of Tate cohomology in the cyclic base change lifting of cuspidal representations. The novelty in this article is that we do not assume that the base change lifting is cuspidal. Later in this article, we study these results for the finite fields case where we obtain a much precise description of the Tate cohomology groups. Finally, we end this article by studying the Tate cohomology of the mod-$\ell$ reduction of the unipotent cuspidal representation of ${\rm Sp}_4(\mathbb{F}_{q^\ell})$ for the action of ${\rm Gal}(\mathbb{F}_{q^\ell}/\mathbb{F}_q)$.</p></details> | Comments are welcome |

Hirschhorn et al. | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent work, Amdeberhan and Merca considered the integer partition function $a(n)$ which counts the number of integer partitions of weight $n$ wherein even parts come in only one color (i.e., they are monochromatic), while the odd parts may appear in one of three colors. One of the results that they proved was that, for all $n\geq 0$, $a(7n+2) \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$. In this work, we generalize this function $a(n)$ by naturally placing it within an infinite family of related partition functions. Using elementary generating function manipulations and classical $q$--series identities, we then prove infinitely many congruences modulo 7 which are satisfied by members of this family of functions.</p></details> |  |

We establish a new proof of the $1/4$ bound towards the Ramanujan conjecture for the trace of the cuspidal part in the ramified case, which is also provided by adapting Altu\u{g}'s original approach. The proof proceeds in three stages: First, we estimate the contributions from the non-elliptic parts of the trace formula. Then, we apply the main result from our the previous work to isolate the $1$-dimensional representations within the elliptic part. Finally, we employ technical analytic estimates to bound the remainder terms in the elliptic part.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, by applying the partial fraction decomposition of $\pi \tan(\pi x)$ and explicit evaluations of the integrals \[ \int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} x^{2m-1} \cos(2l\pi x) dx \quad \text{and} \quad \int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} x^{m-1} \log \cos(\pi x) dx, \] for positive integers $l$ and $m$, we derive closed-form expressions for several classes of infinite series involving $\lambda(s)$. We also demonstrate that the values $\lambda(k)$ for even integers $k \geq 2$ arise as constant terms in the Fourier expansions of Eisenstein series associated with the congruence subgroup \[ \Gamma_0(2) := \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} a & b c & d \end{pmatrix} \in \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}) : c \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \right\}. \]</p></details> | 25 pages |

The visibility of self-similar set has been studied in the past. In this work, we investigate the visibility of non-self-similar sets. We begin by analyzing the structure of $F^2_\lambda$, where $F^2_{\lambda}:=\set{x^2:x\in F_{\lambda}}$ and $F_{\lambda}$ is the middle $1-2\lambda$ Cantor set, we show that it lacks self-similarity. Due to the nonlinear phenomena exhibited by $F^2_\lambda$, we develop a different approach to characterize the visible set. %combining methods from fractal theory, numerical computation, and dynamical systems theory. Our results also reveal that the visible set may contain a closed interval within a large range of $\lambda$.</p></details> | 7 pages |
