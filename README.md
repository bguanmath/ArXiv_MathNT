### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14750v1'>2511.14750</a>\]&nbsp; **Covering Barbasch-Vogan duality and wavefront sets of genuine representations**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Fan Gao, Baiying Liu, Chi-Heng Lo, Freydoon Shahidi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we start by defining a covering Barbasch-Vogan duality and prove some of its properties. Then, for genuine representations of $p$-adic covering groups we formulate an upper bound conjecture for their wavefront sets using this covering Barbasch-Vogan duality and reduce it to anti-discrete representations. The formulation generalizes that of Ciubotaru-Kim and Hazeltine-Liu-Lo-Shahidi for linear algebraic groups. We prove this upper bound conjecture for Kazhdan-Patterson coverings of general linear groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A(s) = \sum_n a_n n^{-s}$ be a Dirichlet series with meromorphic continuation. Say we are given information on the poles of $A(s)$ with $|\Im s| \leq T$ for some large constant $T$. What is the best way to use such finite spectral data to give explicit estimates on sums $\sum_{n\leq x} a_n$? The problem of giving explicit bounds on the Mertens function $M(x) = \sum_{n\leq x} μ(n)$ illustrates how open this basic question was. Bounding $M(x)$ might seem equivalent to estimating $ψ(x) = \sum_{n\leq x} Λ(n)$ or the number of primes $\leq x$. However, we have long had fairly good explicit bounds on prime counts, while bounding $M(x)$ remained a notoriously stubborn problem. We prove a sharp, general result on sums $\sum_{n\leq x} a_n n^{-σ}$ for $a_n$ bounded, giving an optimal way to use information on the poles of $A(s)$ with $|\Im s|\leq T$ and no data on the poles above. Our bounds on $M(x)$ are stronger than previous ones by many orders of magnitude. (Similar results for $ψ(x)$ are given in a companion paper.) Using rigorous residue computations by D. Platt, we obtain, for $x\geq 1$, $$|M(x)|\leq \frac{3}{π\cdot 10^{10}}\cdot x + 11.39 \sqrt{x}.$$ This is a corollary of our main result, essentially an explicit formula with the contribution of each pole clearly stated; we shall discuss how this finer structure can be useful. Our proof mixes a Fourier-analytic approach in the style of Wiener--Ikehara with contour-shifting, using optimal approximants of Beurling--Selberg type (Carneiro--Littmann, 2013); for $σ=1$, the approximant in (Vaaler, 1985) reappears. While we proceed independently of existing explicit work on $M(x)$ and $ψ(x)$, our method has an important step in common with work on another problem by (Ramana--Ramaré, 2020).</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Chenghui Ren &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Preprint. 30 pages, no figures. This work presents an analytic resolution of the twin prime conjecture using weighted sieve integrals. Intended for future journal submission. Comments and feedback are welcome. Keywords: twin prime conjecture, weighted sieve, analytic number theory, logarithmic weights, prime gaps

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The twin prime conjecture asserts that there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by two. While recent advances have improved our understanding of bounded prime gaps, the conjecture remains unresolved. This paper refines the weighted sieve method to estimate a sum over twin prime pairs, where each term is of the form \((1/p)(log(x^{α}/p))^k\). We establish a strict positive lower bound for this sum, which implies the infinitude of twin prime pairs.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 34 pages, accepted for publication in Algebra and Number Theory

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In SGA3, Demazure and Grothendieck showed that if $G$ and $H$ are smooth affine group schemes over a scheme $S$ and $G$ is reductive, then the functor of $S$-homomorphism $G \to H$ is representable. In this paper we extend this result to cover cases in which $G$ is not reductive, with much simpler proofs. Our results apply in particular to parabolics over any base, and they are essentially optimal over a field. We also relate the closed orbits in Hom schemes to Serre's theory of complete reducibility, answer a question of Furter--Kraft, and provide many examples.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study rank-2 cluster scattering diagrams through moduli spaces of quiver representations and a recently developed combinatorial framework of tight gradings. Combining quiver-theoretic and combinatorial methods, we prove and extend a collection of conjectures posed by Elgin--Reading--Stella concerning the structural and enumerative properties of the wall-function coefficients. The tight grading perspective also provides a new proof of the Weyl group symmetry of the scattering diagram.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages. Version 2: added details to clarify topological issues in section 3.5

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a machine for bounding Selmer groups of Galois representations via Euler systems in "non-ordinary" settings, using Pottharst's definition of Selmer groups via Robba-ring $(\varphi, Γ)$-modules. Our approach relies on Sweeting's interpretation of Kolyvagin derivative classes via non-principal ultrafilters. We apply these results to prove new cases of the cyclotomic Iwasawa main conjecture for non-ordinary Rankin--Selberg convolutions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Andrew Knightly, Kimball Martin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a formula for the number of newforms in $S_k^{\mathrm{new}}(N)$ that have prescribed ramified supercuspidal components $π_p$ at a set $T$ of primes dividing $N$. This dimension is given in terms of the trace of the Atkin--Lehner operator at $T$ on $S_k^{\mathrm{new}}(N)$. It depends only upon the weight, the level, the ramified quadratic extensions $E_p/{\mathbb Q}_p$ attached to the $π_p$, and the root number of each $π_p$. The formula is completely explicit when $T$ consists of either a single prime or all prime factors of $N$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Reorganizer the paper by adding a section for preliminaries, adding some details, adding an index section and removing a section on major arcs

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2006, Budur, Mustaţǎ and Saito introduced the notion of Bernstein-Sato polynomial of an arbitrary scheme of finite type over fields of characteristic zero. Because of the strong monodromy conjecture, it should have a corresponding picture on the arithmetic side of ideals in polynomial rings. In this paper, we try to address this problem. Motivated by the Hardy-Littlewood circle method, we introduce the notions of abstract exponential sums modulo $p^m$ and motivic oscillation index of an arbitrary ideal in polynomial rings over number fields. In the arithmetic picture, the abstract exponential sums modulo $p^m$ and the motivic oscillation index of an ideal should play the role of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial and its maximal non-trivial root of the corresponding scheme. We will provide some properties of the motivic oscillation index of ideals in this paper. On the other hand, based on Igusa's conjecture for exponential sums, we propose the averaged Igusa conjecture for exponential sums of ideals. In particular, this conjecture and the motivic oscillation index of ideals will have many interesting applications. We will introduce these applications and prove some variant version of this conjecture.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Victor Ahlquist &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 34 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the low-lying zeros of certain Artin $L$-functions associated with $D_4$-quartic function fields. Specifically, we prove that when ordered by conductor, at least $77\%$ of these $L$-functions are non-vanishing at the central point. This generalises and extends results over $\mathbb{Q}$ due to Durlanik, proving that an infinite number of these $L$-functions are non-vanishing. We obtain these results by examining the low-lying zeros of the $L$-functions using the one-level density. Specifically, we apply and extend a method used by Rudnick, who studied Dirichlet $L$-functions associated with quadratic function field extensions, to the $D_4$-case. The main difficulty is studying $L$-functions which are associated to $D_4$-fields whose quadratic subfield is of large discriminant. These $L$-functions are studied by utilising the so-called flipped field of a $D_4$ extension, combining a method introduced by Friedrichsen for counting $D_4$-fields, with explicit ramification theory in such fields provided by Altuğ, Shankar, Varma and Wilson.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let Y be a random variable whose moment generating function exists in a neighborhood of the origin. Recently, probabilistic Stirling numbers of the first kind and of the second kind associated with Y have been introduced. However, probabilistic stirling number of the first kind based on the cumulant generating function of Y, and probabilistic stirling number of the second kind do not satisfy orthogonality and inverse relations. This paper aims to redefine the probabilistic stirling numbers of the first kind associated with Y such that probabilistic stiirling number of the first kind and probabilistic stirling number of the second kind do satisfy these crucial relations. Furthermore, we investigate their degenerate counterparts, the probabilistic degenerate Stirling numbers of both kinds. We explicitly compute probabilistic stiirling number of the first kind and probabilistic stirling number of the second kind .</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Fatma Çiçek, Pranendu Darbar, Allysa Lumley &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the function field setting with a fixed characteristic, it was proven by the second and third authors that the values $\log \big|L\big(\frac12, χ_D\big)\big|$ as $D$ varies over monic and square-free polynomials are asymptotically Gaussian distributed on the assumption of a low lying zeros hypothesis as the degree of $D$ tends to $\infty$. For real distinct shifts $t_j$ all of microscopic size or all of nonmicroscopic size relative to the genus, we consider linear combinations of $\log\big|L\big(\frac12+it_j, χ_D\big)\big|$ with real coefficients, and separately, of $\arg L\big(\frac12+it_j, χ_D\big).$ We provide estimates for their distribution functions under the low lying zeros hypothesis. We similarly study distribution functions of linear combinations of $\log\big|L\big(\frac12+it_j, E\otimes χ_D\big)\big|$, and separately $\arg L\big(\frac12+it_j, E\otimesχ_D\big)$, for quadratic twists of elliptic curves $E$ with root number one as the conductor gets large. As an application of these results, we prove a central limit theorem for the fluctuation of the number of nontrivial zeros of such $L$-functions from its mean, and thus recover previous results by Faifman and Rudnick. Correlations of such fluctuations are in harmony with the results of Bourgade, Coram and Diaconis, and Wieand for zeros of the Riemann zeta function and for eigenangles of unitary random matrices.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Parvathi S Nair, Veekesh Kumar, S. S. Rout &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $Γ\subset \bar{\Q}^{\times}$ be a finitely generated multiplicative group of algebraic numbers, let $α_1,\ldots,α_m$ be non-zero algebraic numbers, and let $\varepsilon >0$ be fixed. In this paper, we prove that there exist only finitely many tuples $(u_1, \ldots, u_m, q, p)\in Γ^m\times\mathbb{Z}^2$ with $d = [\mathbb{Q}(u_1, \ldots, u_m):\mathbb{Q}]$ such that for any two tuples $(u_1,\ldots,u_m)$ and $(u'_1,\ldots,u'_m)$, we have $\frac{u_{i_1}}{u_{i_2}}\neq \frac{u'_{i_1}}{u'_{i_2}}$ for $1\leq i_1\neq i_2\leq m$ and it is stable under Galois conjugation over $\Q$, $\max\{|α_1 qu_1|, \ldots, |α_m qu_m|\}>1$, the tuple $(α_1qu_1, \ldots, α_mq u_m)$ is not pseudo-Pisot and $$0< \left|\sum_{i=1}^m α_iq u_i - p\right|<\frac{1}{\left(\prod_{i=1}^mH( u_i)\right)^{\varepsilon} |q|^{md+\varepsilon}},$$ where $H(u_i)$ denotes the absolute Weil height. This result extends one of the main results of Corvaja-Zannier \cite{corv}. In addition, we prove a result similar to \cite[Theorem 1.4]{kul} in a more general setting. In our proofs, we exploit the subspace theorem based on the work of Corvaja-Zannier.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Max A. Alekseyev, Rafael Gonzalez, Keryn Loor, Aviad Susman, Cesar Valverde &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Faulhaber's formula expresses the sum of the first $n$ positive integers, each raised to an integer power $p\geq 0$, as a polynomial in $n$ of degree $p+1$. Ramanujan expressed this sum for $p\in\{\frac12,\frac32,\frac52,\frac72\}$ as the sum of a polynomial in $\sqrt{n}$ and a certain infinite series. In the present work, we explore the connection to Bernoulli polynomials, and by generalizing those to formal series, we extend the Ramanujan result to all positive half-integers $p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the behavior of Selmer groups of an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ in finite Galois extensions with prescribed Galois group. Fix a prime $\ell \geq 5$, a finite group $G$ with $\#G = \ell^n$, and an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ with $Sel_\ell(E/\mathbb{Q}) = 0$ and surjective mod-$\ell$ Galois representation. We show that there exist infinitely many Galois extensions $F/\mathbb{Q}$ with Galois group $Gal(F/\mathbb{Q}) \simeq G$ for which the $\ell$-Selmer group $Sel_\ell(E/F)$ also vanishes. We obtain an asymptotic lower bound for the number $M(G, E; X)$ of such fields $F$ with absolute discriminant $|Δ_F|\leq X$, proving that there is an explicit constant $δ>0$ such that $M(G, E; X) \gg X^{\frac{1}{\ell^{n-1}(\ell - 1)}} (\log X)^{δ- 1}$. The asymptotic for $M(G, E; X)$ matches the conjectural count for all $G$-extensions $F/\mathbb{Q}$ for which $|Δ_F|\leq X$, up to a power of $\log X$. This demonstrates that Selmer stability is not a rare phenomenon.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The twisted fourth moment of the Riemann zeta-function was established by Hughes and Young [J. Reine Angew. Math. 641 (2010), 203--236] and later improved by Bettin, Bui, Li and Radziwill [J. Eur. Math. Soc. (JEMS) 22 (2020), 3953--3980]. In applications one would often like to take the Dirichlet polynomial to mimic either $1/ζ^r(s)$ (a mollifier) or $ζ(s)^r$ (an amplifier) for some $r>0$. Previous known results include the mean value of the fourth power of $ζ(s)$ times the square or the fourth power of a mollifier, or the square of an amplifier. In this paper we obtain the asymptotic formula for the fourth moment of the Riemann zeta-function times the fourth power of an amplifier. This has various applications to the theory of the Riemann zeta-function, e.g. gaps between zeros of $ζ(s)$ and lower bounds for moments.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We start with background that goes into an Iwahori-theoretic reformulation of the mod $p$ Local Langlands Correspondence (§2). We then explain some classical $p$-adic functional analytic results (§3) that go into defining the $p$-adic Banach space (§4) attached to a two-dimensional semi-stable representation $V_{k,{\mathcal L}}$ of the Galois group of ${\mathbb Q}_p$ of weight $k$ and ${\mathcal L}$-invariant ${\mathcal L}$ under the $p$-adic Local Langlands correspondence. We then sketch how to compute the reduction of a lattice in this Banach space, which along with the Iwahori mod $p$ LLC, allows one to completely determine the mod $p$ reduction of $V_{k,{\mathcal L}}$ for all weights $3 \leq k \leq p+1$ and all ${\mathcal L}$ for $p \geq 5$ (§5). These notes are a summary of our joint work with Anand Chitrao [CG24]. Emphasis is placed on motivation and background rather than completeness.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We adopt a formal and algebraic approach of Early \cite{E2} to study the positive tropical Grassmannian $\mathrm{Trop}^+ Gr_{k,n}$. Specifically, we deal with positroid subdivision of hypersimplex induced by translated blades from any maximal weakly separated collection. One of our main results gives a necessary and sufficient condition on a maximal weakly separated collection to form a positroid subdivision of a hypersimplex corresponding to a simplicial cone in $\rm Trop^+Gr_{k,n}$. For k = 2 our condition says that any weakly separated collection of two-elements sets gives such a simplicial cone, and all cones are of such a form. We also show that the maximality of any weakly separated collection is preserved under the boundary map, which armatively answers a question by Early in \cite{E1}. Plabic graphs, invented by Postnikov \cite{P}, are of use in proving this result. As a corollary, we get that all those positroid subdivisions are the finest. Thus, the flip of two maximal weakly separatedcollections corresponds to a pair of adjacent maximal cones in positive tropical Grassmannian.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer $x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$ for $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps $x\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In particular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$. This seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the conjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any correspondence between polynomials and positive integers. In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend their domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that correspond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power series. We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\colon F_2[[q]]\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$ otherwise, where $A,B\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some of these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive integers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that $T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the orbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two fixed points. Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these conjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by replacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic integer. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could settle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for both $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Revised exposition following referee comments, changed title, 67 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we apply stack theoretic ideas to the classification problem in Dieudonné theory. First, we use crystalline cohomology of classifying stacks to directly reconstruct the classical Dieudonné module of a finite, $p$-power rank, commutative group scheme $G$ over a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p>0$. As a consequence, we give a new, much shorter proof of the isomorphism $σ^* M(G) \simeq \mathrm{Ext}^1 (G, \mathcal{O}^{\mathrm{crys}})$ due to Berthelot--Breen--Messing using stacky methods combined with the theory of de Rham--Witt complexes. Additionally, we show that finite locally free commutative group schemes of $p$-power rank over a quasisyntomic base can be classified in terms of ``prismatic Dieudonné $F$-gauges", which we introduce by making constructions using (higher) classifying stacks. The latter generalizes the result of Anschütz and Le Bras on classification of $p$-divisible groups, which we also reprove using our approach. Along the way, we prove a description of cohomology with coefficients in group schemes, compatibility with Cartier duality, and reconstruction of Galois representations in terms of our prismatic Dieudonné $F$-gauges.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The generalized Markov equations are deeply connected with the generalized cluster algebras of Markov type. We construct a deformed Fock-Goncharov tropicalization for the generalized Markov equations and prove that their tropicalized tree structure is essentially the same as that of the classical Euclid tree. We then define the generalized Euclid tree and prove that it converges to the classical Euclid tree up to a scalar multiple. Moreover, by means of cluster mutations, we exhibit an asymptotic phenomenon, up to some limit q, between the logarithmic generalized Markov tree and the classical Euclid tree. A rationality conjecture of q is then put forward. We also propose a generalized Markov uniqueness conjecture for the generalized Markov equations, which illustrates an application of the asymptotic phenomenon.</p></details>

Let $P_1,\ldots, P_k\in\mathbb Z[\rm n]$ be polynomials with integer coefficients and distinct degrees. We establish pointwise almost everywhere convergence of the multilinear polynomial ergodic averages $$A_{N; X, T_1,\ldots, T_k}^{P_1,\ldots, P_k}(f_1,\ldots, f_k)(x) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^Nf_1\big(T_1^{P_1(n)}x\big)\cdots f_k\big(T_k^{P_k(n)}x\big), \qquad x\in X, $$cas $N\to\infty$ for any functions $f_1, \ldots, f_k\in L^{\infty}(X)$. Besides a couple of results in the bilinear setting (when $k=2$ and then only for single transformations), this is the first pointwise result for general polynomial multilinear ergodic averages in arbitrary measure-preserving systems. This answers a question of Bergelson from 1996 in the affirmative for any polynomials with distinct degrees, and makes progress on the Furstenberg-Bergelson-Leibman conjecture. In this paper, we build a versatile multilinear circle method by developing the Ionescu-Wainger multiplier theorem for the set of canonical fractions, which gives a positive answer to a question of Ionescu and Wainger from 2005. We also establish sharp multilinear $L^p$-improving bounds and an inverse theorem in higher order Fourier analysis for averages over polynomial corner configurations, which we use to establish a multilinear analogue of Weyl's inequality and its real counterpart, a Sobolev smoothing inequality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The discrepancy sum $D_N(x,ρ)$ for irrational rotations has been of interest to mathematicians for over a century. While historically studied in an ``almost-everywhere'' or asymptotic sense, $D_N$ for finite N is increasingly an object of interest for its nontrivial properties that depend on the Diophantine properties of $ρ$. This behavior is periodic in N with respect to the quotients of the continued fraction convergents, which grow quickly for some irrationals. Thus the stable computation of the sum is necessary for forming conjectures about its properties. However, computing the exact value of the sum and its corresponding probability density function (pdf) is notoriously difficult due to numerical instability in the sum itself and the failure of sampling methods to capture its jump discontinuities. This paper presents a novel computational algorithm that fully defines the discrepancy function and its associated pdf through its discontinuities. This allows the calculation of $D_N(x,ρ)$ to machine precision with minimal storage in O(N) time. This vast improvement in computability over the O(N^2) naive version enables, for the first time, the direct computation of the exact pdf up to machine precision in O(N log N) time, and with it, key properties of the discrepancy: $ \|D_N \|_{\infty}$ (half of the support of the pdf), $ \|D_N \|_{2}^2$ (the variance of the pdf), and the kurtosis of the pdf. A key strength of the algorithm lies in its ability to produce clear, exact figures, allowing the development of mathematical intuition and the quick testing of conjectures. As an example, a newly conjectured pattern is presented: when $ρ$ is well-approximated by rational $\frac{p_n}{q_n}$, the pdf exhibits a predictable spiked-trapezoidal pattern when $N=kq_n$. These shapes degrade as $k$ increases, at a speed depending on how well $\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ approximates $ρ$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p_n$ denote the $n$-th prime. In 2000, Panaitopol established the inequality $p_1 \cdots p_n > p_{n+1}^{n - π(n)}$ for all $n \geq 2$, where $π(x)$ is the prime counting function. In 2021, Yang and Liao refined this by introducing the exponent $k(n,x) = n - π(n) + \frac{π(n)}{π(\log n)} - x \cdot π(π(n))$, proving the inequality holds for $x = 2$ and $n \geq 8$. In 2022, Marques and Trojovský extended this to $x = 1.4$ for $n \geq 21$ and conjectured its validity for $x = 0.1$ when $n \geq 24,154,953$. This paper confirms the conjecture by analyzing the error term $E_n(x) = \log(p_1 \cdots p_n) - k(n,x) \log p_{n+1}$. Also, we derive the asymptotic expansion to $E_n(x)$ demonstrating that it is positive for all sufficiently large $n$ when $x > -2$. For each $x > -2$, we identify a minimal integer $Ψ(x)$ such that $E_n(x) > 0$ for all $n \geq Ψ(x)$, precisely determining $Ψ(0.1) = 24,154,953$. Additionally, we establish effective upper bounds for $Ψ(x)$ both unconditionally and under the Riemann Hypothesis, with the conditional bounds showing a significant improvement. Our analysis fully resolves the conjecture and characterizes $Ψ(x)$ as a non-increasing, piecewise constant function, exhibiting discontinuities at a discrete set of threshold points. These results advance the understanding of Bonse-type inequalities and their asymptotic behavior.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The problem of finding short vectors in Euclidean lattices is a central hard problem in complexity theory. The case of module lattices (i.e., lattices which are also modules over a number ring) is of particular interest for cryptography and computational number theory. The hardness of finding short vectors in the asymptotic regime where the rank (as a module) is fixed is supporting the security of quantum-resistant cryptographic standards such as ML-DSA and ML-KEM. In this article we prove the average-case hardness of this problem for uniformly random module lattices (with respect to the natural invariant measure on the space of module lattices of any fixed rank). More specifically, we prove a polynomial-time worst-case to average-case self-reduction for the approximate Shortest Independent Vector Problem ($γ$-SIVP) where the average case is the (discretized) uniform distribution over module lattices, with a polynomially-bounded loss in the approximation factor, assuming the Extended Riemann Hypothesis. This result was previously known only in the rank-1 case (so-called ideal lattices). That proof critically relied on the fact that the space of ideal lattices is a compact group. In higher rank, the space is neither compact nor a group. Our main tool to overcome the resulting challenges is the theory of automorphic forms, which we use to prove a new quantitative rapid equidistribution result for random walks in the space of module lattices.</p></details>

We describe several general constructions, such as the LCAd of conformal derivations CDer(A) of a differential algebra A, the gauge LCAd G(A,M) associated to a differential algebra A and its module M, the current LCAd F^ of a Lie algebroid F, and the LCAd structure of the space Omega(V) of Kahler differentials over a Poisson vertex algebra (PVA) V. We develop the cohomology theories of LCAd and we relate them to the corresponding cohomology theories of PVA. In particular, we find an isomorphism between the cohomology of a PVA V with coefficients in a module M and the corresponding cohomology of the LCAd Omega(V) with coefficients in the same module.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The cyclotomic matrix is commonly used to arrange cyclotomic numbers in a convenient format. A natural question is whether the structure of the matrix can reflect properties of these numbers. In this article, we examine cyclotomic numbers through their associated cyclotomic matrix and reveal an algebraic structure by relating it to a basis element of a Schur ring. This viewpoint leads to structural identities and reinterpretations of classical results. As an application, we investigate the power difference set problem and establish conditions expressed through cyclotomic matrices, including spectral and determinant characterizations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod n homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}$. As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod n homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected, area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated, and products of area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically area-minimizing. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f:\mathbb{A}^N\to\mathbb{A}^N$ be a regular endomorphism of algebraic degree $d\geq2$ (i.e., $f$ extends to an endomorphism on $\mathbb{P}^N$ of algebraic degree $d$) defined over a number field. We prove that if the set of $f$-preperiodic cyclotomic points is Zariski-dense in $\mathbb{A}^N$, then some iterate $f^{\circ l}$ ($l\geq1$) is a quotient of a surjective algebraic group endomorphism $g:\mathbb{G}_m^N\to\mathbb{G}_m^N$, over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. This is a higher-dimensional generalization of a theorem of Dvornicich and Zannier on cyclotomic preperiodic points of one-variable polynomials. In fact, we prove a much more general rigidity result for all dominant endomorphisms $f$ on an affine variety $X$ defined over a number field, regarding "almost $f$-invariant" Zariski-dense subsets of cyclotomic integral points. As applications, we also apply our results to backward orbits of regular endomorphisms on $\mathbb{A}^N$ of algebraic degree $d\geq2$, and to periodic points of automorphisms of Hénon type on $\mathbb{A}^N$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 64 pages. New hyperbolicity results added to the previous version (Theorem 1.5)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we introduce a class of `parabolic' subgroups for the generalized braid group associated to an arbitrary irreducible complex reflection group, which maps onto the collection of parabolic subgroups of the reflection group. Except for one case, which is proven separately elsewhere, we prove that this collection forms a lattice, so that intersections of parabolic subgroups are parabolic subgroups. In particular, every element admits a parabolic closure, which is the smallest parabolic subgroup containing it. We furthermore prove that it provides a simplicial complex which generalizes the curve complex of the usual braid group. In the case of real reflection groups, this complex generalizes the one previously introduced by Cumplido, Gebhardt, González-Meneses and Wiest for Artin groups of spherical type. We show that it shares similar properties, and similarly conjecture its hyperbolicity, with a few additional results in this direction.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Numerous small improvements based on referee comments. To appear in Bull AMS

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We examine published arguments which suggest that the Riemann Hypothesis may not be true. In each case we provide evidence to explain why the claimed argument does not provide a good reason to doubt the Riemann Hypothesis. The evidence we cite involves a mixture of theorems in analytic number theory, theorems in random matrix theory, and illustrative examples involving the characteristic polynomials of random unitary matrices. Similar evidence is provided for four mistaken notions which appear repeatedly in the literature concerning computations of the zeta-function. A fundamental question which underlies some of the arguments is: what does the graph of the Riemann zeta-function look like in a neighborhood of its largest values? We explore that question in detail and provide a survey of results on the relationship between L-functions and the characteristic polynomials of random matrices. We highlight the key role played by the emergent phenomenon of carrier waves, which arise from fluctuations in the density of zeros. The main point of this paper is that it is possible to understand some aspects of the zeta function at large heights, but the computation evidence is misleading.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 50 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a new approach to symmetry breaking for pairs of real forms of $(GL(n, \mathbb{C}), GL(n-1, \mathbb{C}))$. Translation functors are powerful tools for studying families of representations of a single reductive group $G$. However, when applied to a pair of groups $G \supset G'$, they can significantly alter the nature of symmetry breaking between the representations of $G$ and $G'$, even within the same Weyl chamber of the direct product group $G \times G'$. We introduce the concept of "fences for the interleaving pattern", which provides a refinement of the usual notion of walls of Weyl chambers. We then establish a theorem stating that the multiplicity remains constant unless these "fences" are crossed, together with a new general vanishing theorem for symmetry breaking. These general results are illustrated with examples involving both tempered and non-tempered representations. In addition, we present a new non-vanishing theorem for period integrals for pairs of reductive symmetric spaces, which is further strengthened by this approach.</p></details>

In order to find these distributions we use results about the number of particles in half-infinite and finite site ranges of ASEP. Our investigations also lead to probabilistic proofs of well-known combinatorial identities; the Durfee rectangles identity, Euler's identity, and the $q$-Binomial Theorem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A quantum graph $\mathcal{G}$ housed by a matrix algebra $M_n$ can be encoded as an operator system $\mathcal S=\mathcal{S}_{\mathcal{G}}\le M_n$. There are two sensible notions of quantum automorphism group for any such: $\mathrm{Qut}(\mathcal G)$, capturing the quantum symmetries of the adjacency matrix $A:M_n\to M_n$ attached to $\mathcal{G}$, and $\mathrm{Qut}(\mathcal S\le M_n)$, the quantum group acting universally on $M_n$ so as to preserve its $C^*$ structure, standard trace, and subspace $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$. The two quantum groups coincide classically, but diverge in general. We nevertheless show that both are generically trivial in the sense that they are so for $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$ ranging over a non-empty Zariski-open set under all reasonable dimensional constraints on $\dim \mathcal{S}$ and $n$. This extends analogous prior results by the first and third authors to the effect that classical symmetry groups of still-quantum graphs are generically trivial, and offers a fully quantum counterpart to the familiar probabilistic almost-rigidity of finite graphs. An auxiliary result sheds some light on the relationship between the two notions of quantum automorphism group, identifying the universal preserver of the quantum adjacency matrix of $\mathcal{G}$ with the quantum automorphism group not of $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$, but rather of the complex conjugate $\overline{\mathcal{S}}\le M_n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A partition is a $t$-core partition if $t$ is not one of its hook lengths. Let $c_t(N)$ be the number of $t$-core partitions of $N$. In 1999, Stanton conjectured $c_t(N) \le c_{t+1}(N)$ if $4 \le t \ne N-1$. This was proved for $t$ fixed and $N$ sufficiently large by Anderson, and for small values of $t$ by Kim and Rouse. In this paper, we prove Stanton's conjecture in general. Our approach is to find a saddle point asymptotic formula for $c_t(N)$, valid in all ranges of $t$ and $N$. This includes the known asymptotic formulas for $c_t(N)$ as special cases, and shows that the behavior of $c_t(N)$ depends on how $t^2$ compares in size to $N$. For example, our formula implies that if $t^2 = κN + o(t)$, then $c_t(N) = \frac{\exp\left(2π\sqrt{A N}\right)}{B N} (1 + o(1))$ for suitable constants $A$ and $B$ defined in terms of $κ$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** V2: Result and proof for abelian groups added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Raimi's theorem guarantees the existence of a partition of $\mathbb{N}$ into two parts with an unavoidable intersection property: for any finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, some color class intersects both parts infinitely many times, after an appropriate shift (translation). We establish a polynomial extension of this result, proving that such intersections persist under polynomial shifts in any dimension. Given non-constant polynomials $P^{(1)},\dots,P^{(f)}\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ with positive leading coefficients and $P^{(j)}(0)=0$, we construct a partition of $\mathbb{N}^k$ such that for any coloring of $\mathbb{N}^k$ with finitely many colors, there exist $x_0\in \mathbb{N}$ and a single color class that meets all partition pieces after shifts by $x_0+P^{(j)}(h)$ in each of the $k$ coordinate directions, for every $j$ and infinitely many values $h\in \mathbb{N}$. Our proof exploits Weyl's equidistribution theory, Pontryagin duality, and the structure of polynomial relation lattices. We also prove some finite analogues of the above results for abelian groups and $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$.</p></details>

Suppose that $j(E)$ is a real number and let us consider the set $J(R,E)$ of all $j(E')$ where $E'$ is any elliptic curve that enjoys the following properties. 1) $E'$ is isogenous to $E$; 2) $j(E')$ is a real number; 3) $E'$ has the same parity as $E$. We prove that the closure of $J(R,E)$ in the set $R$ of real numbers is the closed semi-infinite interval $(-\infty,1728]$ (resp. the whole $R$) if $E$ is odd (resp. even). This paper was inspired by a question of Jean-Louis Colliot-Thélène and Alena Pirutka about the distribution of $j$-invariants of certain elliptic curves of CM type.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define new objects called 'horizontal $p$-adic $L$-functions' associated to $L$-values of twists of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ by characters of $p$-power order and conductor prime to $p$. We study the fundamental properties of these objects and obtain applications to non-vanishing of finite order twists of central $L$-values, making progress toward conjectures of Goldfeld and David--Fearnley--Kisilevsky. For general elliptic curves $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ we obtain strong quantitative lower bounds on the number of non-vanishing central $L$-values of twists by Dirichlet characters of fixed order $d\equiv 2 \mod 4$ greater than two. We also obtain non-vanishing results for general $d$, including $d = 2$, under mild assumptions. In particular, for elliptic curves with $E[2](\mathbb{Q}) = 0$ we improve on the previously best known lower bounds on the number of non-vanishing $L$-values of quadratic twists due to Ono. Finally, we obtain results on simultaneous non-vanishing of twists of an arbitrary number of elliptic curves with applications to Diophantine stability.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The constant $π$ has fascinated scholars throughout the centuries, inspiring numerous formulas for its evaluation, such as infinite sums and continued fractions. Despite their individual significance, many of the underlying connections among formulas remain unknown, missing unifying theories that could unveil deeper understanding. The absence of a unifying theory reflects a broader challenge across math and science: knowledge is typically accumulated through isolated discoveries, while deeper connections often remain hidden. In this work, we present an automated framework for the unification of mathematical formulas. Our system combines Large Language Models (LLMs) for systematic formula harvesting, an LLM-code feedback loop for validation, and a novel symbolic algorithm for clustering and eventual unification. We demonstrate this methodology on the hallmark case of $π$, an ideal testing ground for symbolic unification. Applying this approach to 455,050 arXiv papers, we validate 385 distinct formulas for $π$ and prove relations between 360 (94%) of them, of which 166 (43%) can be derived from a single mathematical object - linking canonical formulas by Euler, Gauss, Brouncker, and newer ones from algorithmic discoveries by the Ramanujan Machine. Our method generalizes to other constants, including $e$, $ζ(3)$, and Catalan's constant, demonstrating the potential of AI-assisted mathematics to uncover hidden structures and unify knowledge across domains.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a connected, reductive group $G$ over a finite field endowed with a cocharacter $μ$, we define the zip cone of $(G,μ)$ as the cone of all possible weights of mod $p$ automorphic forms on the stack of $G$-zips. This cone is conjectured to coincide with the cone of weights of characteristic $p$ automorphic forms for Hodge-type Shimura varieties of good reduction. We prove in full generality that the cone of weights of characteristic $0$ automorphic forms is contained in the zip cone, which gives further evidence to this conjecture. Furthermore, we determine exactly when the zip cone is generated by the weights of partial Hasse invariants, which is a group-theoretical generalization of a result of Diamond--Kassaei and Goldring--Koskivirta.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a generalized Floquet-Bloch theory for discrete torsion-free nilpotent groups by exploiting their Malcev completions. Our main result is a branching formula that relates finite-dimensional representations of a discrete nilpotent lattice to infinite-dimensional unitary representations of its simply connected nilpotent Lie group. This generalization enables to extend the following two classical asymptotic problems (i) a Chebotarev density analogue for prime closed geodesics on compact negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent covers, and (ii) long time asymptotic expansions of heat kernels on such coverings to the nilpotent setting. As a by-product, we derive a semi-classical expansion for the Harper operator, presenting an alternative to mathematical justification of Wilkinson's formula by Helffer-Sjöstrand. We conclude by proposing several avenues for future work: extensions to general hyperbolic flows and noncompact manifolds (in particular knot complements and related quasi-morphisms), connections to modified Riemann-Hilbert problems and opers. Furthermore, we give a brief comment on asymptotic behavior of knot invariants and infinite extensions in number theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbb Q$ be an elliptic curve and $p \geq 3$ a prime. The modular curve $X_E^-(p)$ parametrizes elliptic curves with $p$-torsion modules anti-symplectically isomorphic to $E[p]$. We give a complete classification of when $X_E^-(p)(\mathbb Q_\ell)$ is non-empty, for all primes $\ell\neq p$; our result also includes $\ell=p$ in most cases when $E$ is semistable at $p$. We give two different applications. First, we classify CM curves $E/\mathbb Q$ where the modular curve $X_E^-(p)$ is a counterexample to the Hasse principle for infinitely many $p$. Assuming the Frey--Mazur conjecture, we prove that for at least $60\%$ of rational elliptic curves $E$, the modular curve $X_E^-(p)$ is a counterexample to the Hasse principle for at least $50\%$ of primes $p$. Secondly, we introduce a new technique to the elimination stage of the modular method and apply it to show that $x^3+y^3=5^αz^p$ has no non-trivial primitive solutions for various primes $p$ satisfying $(α/p)=-1$. Moreover, as a by-product of our work, we simplify the assumptions of several local symplectic criteria due to the first author and Alain Kraus.</p></details>

For $k=1$ the combinatorial bases in both cases yield the two Capparelli identities and we wanted to see if there is a correspondence between the bases in terms of partitions for all $k\in\mathbb N$. By using the vertex operator relations in the principal picture for level $5$ standard $A_2^{(2)}$-modules we reduce a spanning set of Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt-type vectors in $L(5Λ_0)$ by removing the leading terms of relations and rendering a list of 34 ``difference'' conditions for partitions.We have with computer programs sorted out the sets of partitions satisfying these conditions and formed the partial generating series which agrees with the principally specialized character for all powers of $q$ up to $41$. Although our list of leading terms is incomplete, our results show that the corresponding combinatorial identity for $L_{A_2^{(2)}}(5Λ_0)$ drastically differs from the one for the Borcea dual $L_{A_1^{(1)}}(2Λ_0)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we consider irreducible quasi-finite (or equivalently weakly integrable) modules, with non-trivial action of the core, over the extended affine Lie algebras (EALAs) whose centerless cores are multiloop algebras. The centerless cores of all but one family of EALAs having nullity greater than 1 are known to admit such multiloop realizations. For any such (untwisted) EALA, we show that the irreducible quasi-finite modules are either integrable with the center of the underlying core acting trivially, or restricted generalized highest weight (GHW) modules. We further prove that in the nullity 2 case, these irreducible restricted GHW modules turn out to be highest weight type modules, thereby classifying the irreducible quasi-finite modules over all such EALAs. In particular, we obtain the classification of irreducible quasi-finite modules over toroidal Lie algebras, minimal EALAs and toroidal EALAs of nullity 2. Along the way, we completely classify the irreducible weakly integrable modules over affine Kac-Moody algebras (studied by Rao-Futorny [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 2009] for non-zero level modules). Our results generalize the well-known work of Chari [Invent. Math. 1986] and Chari-Pressley [Math.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra, $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ its quantum group, and $U_q(\mathfrak{k}) \subset U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ a quantum symmetric pair subalgebra determined by a Lie algebra automorphism $θ$. We introduce a category $W_θ$ of weight $U_q(\mathfrak{k})$-modules, which is acted on by the category of weight $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-modules via tensor products. We construct a universal tensor K-matrix $\mathbb{K}$ (that is, a solution of a reflection equation) in a completion of $U_q(\mathfrak{k}) \otimes U_q(\mathfrak{g})$. This yields a natural operator on any tensor product $M \otimes V$, where $M\in W_θ$ and $V\in {O}_θ$, that is $V$ is a $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-module in category ${O}$ satisfying an integrability property determined by $θ$. Canonically, $W_θ$ is equipped with a structure of a bimodule category over ${O}_θ$ and the action of $\mathbb{K}$ is encoded by a new categorical structure, which we call a boundary structure on $W_θ$. This generalizes a result of Kolb which describes a braided module structure on finite-dimensional $U_q(\mathfrak{k})$-modules when $\mathfrak{g}$ is finite-dimensional. We also consider our construction in the case of the category ${C}$ of finite-dimensional modules over a quantum affine algebra, providing the most comprehensive universal framework to date for large families of solutions of parameter-dependent reflection equations. In this case the tensor K-matrix gives rise to a formal Laurent series with a well-defined action on tensor products of any module in $W_θ$ and any module in ${C}$. This series can be normalized to an operator-valued rational function, which we call trigonometric tensor K-matrix, if both factors in the tensor product are in ${C}$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Alireza Nasr-Isfahani &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite-dimensional algebra Λ, we establish an explicit bijection between widely generated torsion(-free) classes and semibricks in mod Λ. Using the kappa order on the lattice of torsion classes with canonical join representations, we provide several equivalent conditions for brick-finite algebras. We show that Λ is brick-finite if and only if any chain of wide subcategories of mod Λ becomes eventually constant, if and only if any torsion class in mod Λ has finitely many covers, if and only if every semibrick in mod Λ is a finite set. Thus, we give a proof of Enomoto's conjecture (Adv. Math., 393 (2021), 108113). As a consequence, we show that Λ is brick-finite if and only if every wide subcategory closed under coproducts of Mod Λ is closed under products, if and only if every wide subcategory of mod Λ is functorially finite. This gives a positive answer to the question posed by Angeleri Hügel and Sentieri (J. Algebra, 664 (2025), 164-205).</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages; minor changes in exposition

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we develop a metric theory of inhomogeneous Diophantine approximation for the case of a fixed matrix. We use transference principle to connect uniform Diophantine properties of a pair $(Θ, \pmbη)$ of a matrix and a vector with the asymptotic Diophantine properties of the transposed matrix $Θ^{\top}$, and vice versa, the asymptotic Diophantine properties of a pair $(Θ, \pmbη)$ with asymptotic Diophantine properties of the transposed matrix. In these setups, we prove analogues of classical statements of metrical homogeneous Diophantine approximations and answer some open questions that were raised in recent works.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 16 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a field of characteristic $0$ and $E/K$ an elliptic curve over $K$. For a finite extension $L/K$ and a prime $\ell$, we provide Galois-theoretic sufficient conditions on $L/K$ under which $E\left(L\right)\left[\ell^{\infty}\right] = E\left(K\right)\left[\ell^{\infty}\right]$. For a non-Galois extension $L/K$ of prime degree, we relate the growth of the $\ell^{\infty}$-torsion subgroup of $E$ under the base change $L/K$ to the image of the mod-$\ell$ cyclotomic character. In particular, we refine Najman's result by ruling out certain torsion structures for cubic non-Galois extensions $L/\mathbb{Q}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish asymptotic lower bounds for the number of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ with prescribed entanglement of division fields, ordered by naive height. Such elliptic curves are obtained as $1$-parameter families arising from certain genus $0$ modular curves. We apply techniques from the geometry of numbers and sieve methods to prove that the number of elliptic curves with unexplained entanglements $\mathbb{Q}(E[2]) \cap \mathbb{Q}(E[3]) \neq \mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Q}(E[2]) \cap \mathbb{Q}(E[5]) \neq \mathbb{Q}$ and naive height $\leq X$, grows as $\gg X^{1/9}$ and $\gg X^{1/12}$, respectively.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a minimalistic presentation for the twisted Yangian ${}^\imath\mathscr Y$ associated with split symmetric pairs (or Satake diagrams) introduced in arXiv:2406.05067 via a Drinfeld type presentation. As applications, we establish an injective algebra homomorphism from ${}^\imath\mathscr Y$ to the Yangian $\mathscr Y$, thereby identifying ${}^\imath\mathscr Y$ as a right coideal subalgebra of $\mathscr Y$ and proving its isomorphism with the twisted Yangian in the $J$ presentation. Furthermore, we provide estimates for the Drinfeld generators of ${}^\imath\mathscr Y$ and describe their coproduct images in terms of the Drinfeld generators of $\mathscr Y$ under this identification.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider certain families of Hecke characters $φ$ over a quadratic imaginary field $F$. According to the Bloch-Beilinson conjectures, the order of vanishing of the $L$-function $L(φ,s)$ at the central point $s=-1$ should be equal to the dimension of the space of extensions of the Tate motive $\mathbb{Q}(1)$ by the motive associated with $φ$. In this article, we construct candidates for the corresponding extensions of Hodge structures, assuming that the sign of the functional equation of $L(φ,s)$ is $-1$. This is accomplished through the cohomology of variations of Hodge structures over Picard modular surfaces associated with $F$ and Harder's theory of Eisenstein cohomology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these extensions are naturally realized within certain biextensions. We outline a program to compute the biextension height and utilize it to establish the non-triviality of these extensions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Our goal in this paper is to introduce and study the Euler system of signed diagonal cycles associated with a trito-non-ordinary triple product of the form $f^B \times g^B \times \mathbf{h}^B$, where $f^B$ (resp. $g^B$) is a $p$-ordinary (resp. non-ordinary) eigenform on an indefinite quaternion algebra $B_{/\mathbb{Q}}$ of weight $2$, and $\mathbf{h}^B$ is a primitive Hida ($p$-ordinary) family. When $B=\mathrm{M}_2(\mathbb{Q})$ is split and $\mathbf{h}=\mathbf{h}^B$ has CM by an imaginary quadratic field, this allows us to develop the signed anticyclotomic Iwasawa theory for the base change $\mathrm{BC}_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(π_f)\times \mathrm{BC}_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(π_g)\times ψ$, where $ψ$ is a Hecke character of $K$. We formulate a signed Perrin-Riou-style Iwasawa main conjecture in this setting, and obtain a result on one inclusion in this conjecture. Our methods also allow us to extend Hsieh's construction of the balanced triple-product $p$-adic $L$-function to the trito-non-ordinary scenario, and to define its signed counterparts.</p></details>
