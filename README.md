### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15214v1'>2509.15214</a>\]&nbsp; **Zeta functions of abstract isogeny graphs and modular curves**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jun Bo Lau, Travis Morrison, Eli Orvis, Gabrielle Scullard, Lukas Zobernig &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a ``non-orientable'' variation of Serre's definition of a graph, which we call an abstract isogeny graph. These objects capture the combinatorics of the graphs $G(p,\ell,H)$, the $\ell$-isogeny graphs of supersingular elliptic curves with $H$-level structure. In particular they allow for the study of non-backtracking walks, primes, and zeta functions. We prove an analogue of Ihara's determinant formula for the zeta function of an abstract isogeny graph. For $B_1(N) \subseteq H \subseteq B_0(N)$ and $p > 3$, we use this formula to relate the Ihara zeta function of $G(p,\ell,H)$ to the Hasse-Weil zeta functions of the modular curves $X_{H, {\mathbb{F}_{\ell}}}$ and $X_{H \times B_0(p), \mathbb{F}_{\ell}}$. As applications, we give an explicit formula relating point counts on $X_0(pN)_{\mathbb{F}_{\ell}}$ and $X_0(N)_{\mathbb{F}_{\ell}}$ to cycle counts in $G(p,\ell,B_0(N))$ and prove that the number of non-backtracking cycles of length $r$ in $G(p,\ell,B_0(N))$ is asymptotic to $\ell^r$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We continue and generalise our earlier investigations of the number of squares in binary recurrence sequences. Here we consider sequences, $\left( y_{k} \right)_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}$, arising from the solutions of generalised negative Pell equations, $X^{2}-dY^{2}=c$, where $-c$ and $y_{0}$ are any positive squares. We show that there are at most $2$ distinct squares larger than an explicit lower bound in such sequences. From this result, we also show that there are at most $5$ distinct squares when $y_{0}=b^{2}$ for infinitely many values of $b$, including all $1 \leq b \leq 24$, as well as once $d$ exceeds an explicit lower bound, without any conditions on the size of such squares.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We extend our previous classification of stacky curves in positive characteristic using higher ramification data and Artin-Schreier-Witt theory. The main new technical tool introduced is the Artin-Schreier-Witt root stack, a generalization of root stacks to the wildly ramified setting. We then apply our wild Riemann-Hurwitz theorem for stacks to compute the canonical rings of some wild stacky curves.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Dirichlet's Lemma states that every primitive quadratic Dirichlet character $\chi$ can be written in the form $\chi(n) = (\frac{\Delta}n)$ for a suitable quadratic discriminant $\Delta$. In this article we define a group, the separant class group, that measures the extent to which Dirichlet's Lemma fails in general number fields $F$. As an application we will show that over fields with trivial separant class groups, genus theory of quadratic extensions can be made as explicit as over the rationals.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let G|V, G connected, reductive over C, be a stable polar representation in the sense of [DK], satisfying some mild additional hypotheses. Given a G-equivariant rank one local system L on the general fiber of the quotient map f : V --> V/G, we compute the Fourier transform of the corresponding nearby cycle sheaf P on the zero-fiber of f. This provides a partial generalization of the results of [Gr1] and [GVX1]. Our main intended application is to the theory of character sheaves for graded Lie algebras over C.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 31 pages, accepted version in "Research in Number Theory"

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate a Dirichlet series involving the Fourier-Jacobi coefficients of two cusp forms $F,G$ for orthogonal groups of signature $(2,n+2)$. In the case when $F$ is a Hecke eigenform and $G$ is a Maass lift of a Poincar\'e series, we establish a connection with the standard $L$-function attached to $F$. What is more, we find explicit choices of orthogonal groups, for which we obtain a clear-cut Euler product expression for this Dirichlet series. Through our considerations, we recover a classical result for Siegel modular forms, first introduced by Kohnen and Skoruppa, but also provide a range of new examples, which can be related to other kinds of modular forms, such as paramodular, Hermitian, and quaternionic.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 47 pages, 12 figures. V3: Comments on "peculiar" ability to evaluate Euler characteristics added (see section 7), references updated

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that for any possibly-punctured surface with non-empty boundary $\mathbf{\Sigma}=(\Sigma, \mathbb{M}, \mathbb{P})$, and any tagged triangulation $T$ of $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ in the sense of Fomin--Shapiro--Thurston, the coefficient-free bangle functions of Musiker--Schiffler--Williams coincide with the coefficient-free generic Caldero--Chapoton functions arising from the Jacobian algebra of the quiver with potential $(Q(T), W(T))$ associated to $T$ by Cerulli Irelli and the second author. When the set of boundary marked points $\mathbb{M}$ has at least two elements, Schr\"oer and the first two authors have shown, relying heavily on results of Mills, Muller and Qin, that the generic coefficient-free Caldero-Chapoton functions form a basis of the coefficient-free (upper) cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{\Sigma})=\mathcal{U}(\mathbf{\Sigma})$. So, the set of bangle functions proposed by Musiker--Schiffler--Williams over ten years ago is indeed a basis.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jungin Lee, GyeongHyeon Nam &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a field $L$ of characteristic $p$, a polynomial $f \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p[x]$ and $\alpha, \beta \in L$, let $\mathrm{Prep}(f;\alpha,\beta)$ be the set of all $\lambda \in \overline{L}$ such that both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are preperiodic under the action of $f_{\lambda}(x) := f(x) + \lambda$. Ghioca and Hsia proved that for certain families of polynomials, this set is infinite if and only if $f(\alpha)=f(\beta)$ or $\alpha, \beta \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$. Building on their earlier work, we determine the condition that $\mathrm{Prep}(f;\alpha,\beta)$ is infinite for two classes of binomials that were left open. Specifically, let $f(x)=c_1 x^{d_1} + c_2 x^{d_2} \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p[x]$, where $c_i \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p^*$, $1 \le d_1 < d_2$ and $d_i=p^{\ell_i}s_i$ with $\ell_i \ge 0$ and $p \nmid s_i$. We prove that if $p \nmid s_1-1$ or $s_2=1$, then $\mathrm{Prep}(f;\alpha,\beta)$ is infinite if and only if $f(\alpha)=f(\beta)$ or $\alpha, \beta \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$. The key idea of the proof is to use the parameters $\lambda_{\overline{\alpha}} := \overline{\alpha} - f(\overline{\alpha})$ associated to suitable elements $\overline{\alpha} \in \overline{L}$ satisfying $f(\overline{\alpha})=f(\alpha)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 10 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove prime exponential sums have no better than square root cancellation on average on short intervals, in the sense that $$\frac{1}{x} \sum_{-y< n\le x} \left|\sum_{\substack{n< m \le n+y\\ 1\le m \le x}} \Lambda(m) \mathrm{e}(\alpha m)\right|^2 \gg y\log y$$ whenever $y \ll x^{1/3-\varepsilon}.$ This answers a question of Ramar\'e by proving the lower bound $$\sup_{n\le x} \left|\sum_{m\le n} \Lambda(m) \mathrm{e}(\alpha m)\right| \gg x^{1/6 - \varepsilon}.$$</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Johann Verwee &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 8 pages, no figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We revisit the effective Erdos-Wintner theorem for Zeckendorf expansions. Drmota and the author obtained a uniform Kolmogorov bound whose error involves $T\sum_{j>L-2h}|f(F_j)|$, which assumes absolute convergence of the linear tail $\sum_j f(F_j)$. We remove this assumption. Grouping the transfer matrices in pairs and working to second order on the logarithm of the product, after extracting the common linear phase along the dominant direction, yields a quadratic tail $T^2\sum_{j>L-2h} f(F_j)^2$, or, in a flexible variant, the split tail $T\sum_{|f(F_j)|>1/T}|f(F_j)| + T^2\sum_{|f(F_j)|\le 1/T} f(F_j)^2$. Either form requires only $\sum f(F_j)^2<\infty$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 57 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We classify the shift operators for the symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials and construct shift operators for the non-symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials using two decompositions of non-symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials in terms of symmetric ones. These shift operators are difference-reflection operators, and we discuss the conditions under which they restrict to shift operators for the symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials. We use them to compute the norms of the non-symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials and compute their specialisations for $q\to1$. These turn out to be shift operators for the non-symmetric Heckman-Opdam polynomials of type $BC_1$ that have recently been found.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A maximal curve over a finite field $\mathbb F_q$ is a curve whose number of points reaches the upper Hasse-Weil-Serre bound. We define the discriminant of $\mathbb F_q$ as $d(\mathbb F_q):= \lfloor2\sqrt{q}\rfloor^2-4q$, which arises as the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius for a maximal elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb F_q$. In this article we investigate the existence of a maximal curve of genus $5$ defined over a finite field $\mathbb F_q$ of discriminant $-19$. Using the knowledge on the automorphism group of such a curve, we prove that such curve does not exist when $q\equiv 2,3,4 \mod 5$. In the case $q\equiv 1\mod 5$ we give models of the potential maximal curve. Finally, for the case $q\equiv 0\bmod 5$, we prove that such a curve might exist only for $q=5^7$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Alessandro Ardizzoni, Claudia Menini, Paolo Saracco &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A well-known result by Larson and Sweedler shows that integrals on a Hopf algebra can be obtained by applying the Structure Theorem for Hopf modules to the rational part of its linear dual. This fact can be rephrased by saying that taking the space of integrals comes from a right adjoint functor from a category of modules to the category of vector spaces. This observation inspired the categorical approach that we advocate in this work, which yields to a new notion of integrals for bialgebras in the linear setting. Despite the novelty of the construction, it returns the classical definition in the presence of an antipode. We test this new concept on bialgebras that satisfy at least one of the following properties: being coseparable as regular module coalgebras, having a one-sided antipode, being commutative, being cocommutative, or being finite-dimensional. One of the main results we obtain in this process is a dual Maschke-type theorem relating coseparability and total integrals. Remarkably, there are cases in which the space of integrals turns out to be isomorphic to that of the associated Hopf envelope. In particular, this space results to be one-dimensional for finite-dimensional bialgebras, providing an existence and uniqueness theorem for integrals in the finite-dimensional case. Furthermore, explicit computations are given for concrete examples including the polynomial bialgebra with one group-like variable, the quantum plane and the coordinate bialgebra of $n$-by-$n$ matrices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An isogeny class $\mathcal{A}$ of abelian varieties defined over finite fields is said to be "cyclic" if every variety in $\mathcal{A}$ has a cyclic group of rational points. In this paper we study the local cyclicity of Weil-central isogeny classes of abelian varieties, i.e. those with Weil polynomials of the form $f_\mathcal{A}(t)=t^{2g}+at^g+q^g$, as well as the local growth of the groups of rational points of the varieties in $\mathcal{A}$ after finite field extensions. We exploit the criterion: an isogeny class $\mathcal{A}$ with Weil polynomial $f$ is cyclic if and only if $f'(1)$ is coprime with $f(1)$ divided by its radical.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** SanMin Wang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let \( E \) be a complex elliptic curve with conductor \( N \) and modular invariant \( j(E) \in \mathbb{Q} \). We construct a class of modular polynomials $F_N(x,j)$ that relate the modular function $x$ on $X_0(N)$ to the $j$-invariant $j$, where $x$ is obtained by composing the first coordinate function of $E$ with the modular parametrization $\varphi: X_0(N) \rightarrow E$. Using $F_N(x,j)$, we can precisely determine the poles of $\varphi$, compute exact values of $\varphi$ at cusps, and develop an algorithm for calculating ramification points of $\varphi$. Moreover, $F_N(x,j)$ yields an efficient algorithm for computing the fibres of $\varphi$ over arbitrary points on $E$. In some sense, $F_N(x,j)$ also provides a ``total" formula for computing the minimal polynomial of the images of Heegner points on $X_0(N)$ under $\varphi$. Especially, we compute the semi-trace of the image $\varphi ([\frac{{ - 1 + \sqrt { - 3} }}{2}])$ of the CM-point $[\frac{-1 + \sqrt{-3}}{2}]$ on $X_{0}(389)$, under the action of a 65-element subgroup of the 260-element Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3}, j(389 \cdot \frac{-1 + \sqrt{-3}}{2}))$. Finally, we associate a point of infinite order in~\( E(\mathbb{Q}) \) with an infinite sequence~$\{ (j(\tau_n), j(N\tau_n)) \}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}^+} $ of algebraic numbers whose degrees are bounded by the degree of~$\varphi$. This provides one seemingly practicable approach to addressing the BSD conjecture.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Faustin Adiceam, Dzmitry Badziahin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a prime $p$, the $p$-adic Littlewood Conjecture stands as a well-known arithmetic variant of the celebrated Littlewood Conjecture in Diophantine Approximation. In the same way as the latter, it admits a natural function field analogue depending on the choice of an irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ with coefficients in a field $\mathbb{K}$. This analogue is referred to as the $P(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture ($P(t)$-LC for short). $P(t)$-LC is proved to fail for any choice of irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ over any ground field $\mathbb{K}$ with characteristic $ \ell \equiv 3\pmod{4}$. The counterexample refuting it is shown to present a local arithmetic obstruction emerging from the fact that -1 is not a quadratic residue modulo a prime $\ell\equiv 3\pmod{4}$. The theory developed elucidates and generalises all previous approaches towards refuting the conjecture. They were all based on the computer-assisted method initiated by Adiceam, Nesharim and Lunnon (2021) which has been able to establish that $P(t)$-LC fails in some small characteristics (essentially up to 11). This computer-assisted method is, however, unable to provide a general statement as it relies on ad hoc computer verifications which, provided they terminate, refute $P(t)$--LC in a given characteristic. This limitation is overcome by exhibiting an arithmetic obstruction to the validity of $P(t)$--LC in infinitely many characteristics. The existence of arithmetic obstructions within the context of $P(t)$--LC leaves the remaining case of odd characteristics $ \ell\equiv 1\pmod{4}$ dependent on their determination. This is shown to hold in an effective and explicit way.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 19 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any block of a finite group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $2$ which has dihedral, semidihedral, or generalized quaternion defect groups, we determine explicitly the decomposition of the associated diagonal $p$-permutation functor over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $0$ into a direct sum of simple functors. As a consequence we see that two blocks with dihedral, semidihedral, or generalized quaternion defect groups are functorially equivalent over $\mathbb{F}$ if and only if their fusion systems are isomorphic. It is an open question if two blocks (with arbitrary defect groups) that are functorially equivalent over $\mathbb{F}$ must have isomorphic fusion systems. The converse is wrong in general.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages, final version (to appear in Advances in Mathematics)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by the 1920's seminal work of Major MacMahon, Amdeberhan--Andrews--Tauraso recently introduced an infinite family of $q$-series $$ \mathcal{U}_{t}(a;q):= \sum_{1\le n_1<n_2<\cdots<n_t} \frac{q^{n_1+n_2+\cdots+n_t}}{(1+aq^{n_1}+q^{2n_1})(1+aq^{n_2}+q^{2n_2})\cdots (1+aq^{n_t}+q^{2n_t})} $$ and proved that these functions are linear combinations of quasimodular forms. In this paper, we study a broader family of $q$-series that contains the collection $\{\mathcal{U}_t\}_{t \in \mathbb{N}}$. Using the theory of quasi shuffle algebras, we show that this extended family also lies in the algebra of quasimodular forms. Moreover, we determine the precise weights and levels of these functions, thereby making Amdeberhan--Andrews--Tauraso's result sharp. We further investigate the limiting behavior of these functions. In particular, we demonstrate that the sequence of quasimodular forms~$\{\mathcal{U}_t(1;q)\}_{t\in\mathbb{N}}$ gives an approximation for the ordinary partition function. We also establish infinitely many closed formulas for reciprocals of certain infinite products in terms of~$\mathcal{U}_{t}(a;q)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unlike the Hochschild chain complex of an algebra, the Hochschild cochain complex of an algebra is not functorial. Nonetheless, we show that the Hochschild cochain complex of an algebra even a dg category is of lax functoriality, i.e., there exists a lax functor from bicategory of dg categories to bicategory of $B_\infty$-algebras which sends every dg category to its Hochschild cochain complex. This result is a homotopy version of the lax functoriality of center of an algebra obtained by Davydov, Kong, Runkel, Grady, Oren, et al, in the more general context of dg categories, and extends the restricted functoriality of Hochschild cochain complex of a dg category obtained by Keller to global lax functoriality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Machine learning explorations can make significant inroads into solving difficult problems in pure mathematics. One advantage of this approach is that mathematical datasets do not suffer from noise, but a challenge is the amount of data required to train these models and that this data can be computationally expensive to generate. Key challenges further comprise difficulty in a posteriori interpretation of statistical models and the implementation of deep and abstract mathematical problems. We propose a method for scalable tasks, by which models trained on simpler versions of a task can then generalize to the full task. Specifically, we demonstrate that a transformer neural-network trained on predicting permutations from words formed by general transpositions in the symmetric group $S_{10}$ can generalize to the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with near 100\% accuracy. We also show that $S_{10}$ generalizes to $S_{16}$ with similar performance if we only use adjacent transpositions. We employ identity augmentation as a key tool to manage variable word lengths, and partitioned windows for training on adjacent transpositions. Finally we compare variations of the method used and discuss potential challenges with extending the method to other tasks.</p></details>

We prove a generalization of this theorem for real reductive groups in the case when $G$ is adjoint. More specifically, if $\mathcal{N}_\theta$ denotes the cone of nilpotent elements in a Cartan subspace $\mathfrak{p},$ we have a similar construction of a resolution of singularities $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}.$ We prove that for a certain cone of weights $H^i(\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta},\mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}}(\lambda))=0$ for $i> 0.$ This follows by combining a simple calculation of the canonical bundle for $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}$ with Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing. We use this to show that for groups of QCT (Definition 2), $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{N}_\theta]$ is equivalent as a $K$-representation to a certain cohomologically induced module giving a new proof of a result in \cite{KostantRallis1971}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer $x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$ for $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps $x\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In particular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$. This seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the conjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any correspondence between polynomials and positive integers. In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend their domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that correspond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power series. We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\colon F_2[[q]]\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$ otherwise, where $A,B\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some of these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive integers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that $T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the orbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two fixed points. Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these conjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by replacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic integer. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could settle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for both $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The demand to know the structure of functionally independent invariants of tensor fields arises in many problems of theoretical and mathematical physics, for instance for the construction of interacting higher-order tensor field actions. In mathematical terms the problem can be formulated as follows. Given a semi-simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ and a $\mathfrak g$-module $V$, one may ask about the structure of the sub-ring of $\mathfrak g$-invariants inside the ring freely generated by the module. We point out how some information about the ring of invariants may be obtained by studying an extended Lie algebra. Numerous examples are given, with particular focus on the difficult problem of classifying invariants of a self-dual 5-form in 10 dimensions.</p></details>

Also the Lie derivative of a vector field parameterised by another is generalised and expressed in a simple way in terms of this superalgebra.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical notion of splitting a binary quadratic operad $\mathcal{P}$ gives the notion of pre-$\mathcal{P}$-algebras characterized by $\mathcal{O}$-operators, with pre-Lie algebras as a well-known example. Pre-$\mathcal{P}$-algebras give a refinement of the structure of $\mathcal{P}$-algebras and is critical in the Manin triple approach to bialgebras for $\mathcal{P}$-algebras. Motivated by the new types of splitting appeared in recent studies, this paper aims to extend the classical notion of splitting, by relaxing the requirement that the adjoint actions of the pre-$\mathcal{P}$-algebra form a representation of the $\mathcal{P}$-algebra, to allow also linear combinations of the adjoint actions to form a representation. This yields a whole family of type-$M$ pre-structures, parameterized by the coefficient matrix $M$ of the linear combinations. Using the duals of the adjoint actions gives another family of splittings. Similar generalizations are given to the $\mathcal{O}$-operator characterization of the splitting, and to certain conditions on bilinear forms. Furthermore, this general framework is applied to determine the bialgebra structure induced from averaging Lie bialgebras, lifting the well-known fact that an averaging Lie algebra induces a Leibniz algebra to the level of bialgebras. This is achieved by interpreting the desired bialgebra structure for the Leibniz algebra as the one for a special type-$M$ pre-Leibniz algebra for a suitably chosen matrix $M$ in the above family.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The deformation approach of arXiv:2104.07816 for computing zeta functions of one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds is generalised to cover also multiparameter manifolds. Consideration of the multiparameter case requires the development of an improved formalism. This allows us, among other things, to make progress on some issues left open in previous work, such as the treatment of apparent and conifold singularities and changes of coordinates. We also discuss the efficient numerical computation of the zeta functions. As examples, we compute the zeta functions of the two-parameter mirror octic, a non-symmetric split of the quintic threefold also with two parameters, and the $S_5$ symmetric five-parameter Hulek-Verrill manifolds. These examples allow us to exhibit the several new types of geometries for which our methods make practical computations possible. They also act as consistency checks, as our results reproduce and extend those of arXiv:hep-th/0409202 and arXiv:math/0304169. To make the methods developed here more approachable, a Mathematica package "CY3Zeta" for computing the zeta functions of Calabi-Yau threefolds, which is attached to this paper, is presented.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{P}_k(\delta)$, where $k$ is a positive integer and $\delta$ some complex parameter, be the classical partition algebra over the complex numbers. In the case when $\delta=n$, it is well-known that the algebra $\mathcal{P}_k(\delta)$ is the centralizer of the symmetric group $S_n$ acting on the $k$-fold tensor space of the natural representation of $S_n$, for $n\geq 2k$. The algebra $\mathcal{P}_k(\delta)$ is semi-simple for generic values of $\delta$. In this paper, we show that semi-simple partition algebras appear as the centralizer algebras for certain representations of the rook monoids given by an iterative restriction-induction of the trivial representation. Along the way, we also give a decomposition of this iterative representation of the rook monoid into various tensor spaces and show that the corresponding dimensions are given by generalized Bell numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the field of characteristic two, $\mathbb F_2.$ Denote by $GL(q)$ the general linear group of rank $q$ over $\mathbb F_2.$ The algebraic transfer, introduced by W. Singer [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523], is a rather effective tool for unraveling the intricate structure of the (mod-2) cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr A}^{q,*}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2).$ The Kameko homomorphism is one of the useful tools to study the dimension of the domain of the Singer transfer. Singer conjectured that the algebraic transfer is always a monomorphism, but this remains open for all homology degrees $q\geq 5.$ In this paper, by constructing a novel algorithm implemented in the computer algebra system OSCAR for computing $GL(q)$-invariants of the kernel of the Kameko homomorphism, we disprove Singer's conjecture for bidegree $(6,6+36).$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser recently considered a family of binomial determinants. In this work, we give combinatorial interpretations of two subclasses of these determinants in terms of domino tilings and nonintersecting lattice paths, thereby partially answering a question of theirs. Furthermore, the determinant evaluations established by Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser produce many product formulas for our weighted enumerations of domino tilings and nonintersecting lattice paths. However, there are still two enumerations left corresponding to conjectural formulas made by the three. We hereby prove the two conjectures using the principle of holonomic Ansatz plus the approach of modular reduction for creative telescoping, and hence fill the gap.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we define a Grothendieck ring as a fusion ring categorifiable into a fusion category over the complex field. An integral fusion ring is called Drinfeld if all its formal codegrees are integers dividing the global Frobenius--Perron dimension. Every integral Grothendieck ring is necessarily Drinfeld. Using the fact that the formal codegrees of integral Drinfeld rings form an Egyptian fraction summing to 1, we derive a finite list of possible global FPdims for small ranks. Applying Normaliz, we classify all fusion rings with these candidate FPdims, retaining only those admitting a Drinfeld structure. To exclude Drinfeld rings that are not Grothendieck rings, we analyze induction matrices to the Drinfeld center, classified via our new Normaliz feature. Further exclusions and constructions involve group-theoretical fusion categories and Schur multipliers. Our main result is a complete classification of integral Grothendieck rings up to rank 5, extended to rank 7 in odd-dimensional and noncommutative cases using Frobenius--Schur indicators and Galois theory. Moreover, we show that any noncommutative, odd-dimensional, integral Grothendieck ring of rank at most 22 is pointed of rank 21. We also classify all integral 1-Frobenius Drinfeld rings of rank 6, identify the first known non-Isaacs integral fusion category (which turns out to be group-theoretical), classify integral noncommutative Drinfeld rings of rank 8, and integral 1-Frobenius MNSD Drinfeld rings of rank 9. Finally, we determine the smallest-rank exotic simple integral fusion rings: rank 4 in general, rank 6 in the Drinfeld case, and rank 7 in the 1-Frobenius Drinfeld case.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 57 pages, final version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study isolated quotient singularities by finite and linearly reductive group schemes (lrq singularities for short) and show that they satisfy many, but not all, of the known properties of finite quotient singularities in characteristic zero: (1) From the lrq singularity we can recover the group scheme and the quotient presentation. (2) We establish canonical lifts to characteristic zero, which leads to a bijection between lrq singularities and certain characteristic zero counterparts. (3) We classify subgroup schemes of ${\mathbf{GL}}_d$ and ${\mathbf{SL}}_d$ that correspond to lrq singularities. For $d=2$, this generalises results of Klein, Brieskorn, and Hashimoto. Also, our classification is closely related to the spherical space form problem. (4) F-regular (resp. F-regular and Gorenstein) surface singularities are precisely the lrq singularities by finite and linearly reductive subgroup schemes of ${\mathbf{GL}}_2$ (resp. ${\mathbf{SL}}_2$). This generalises results of Klein and Du Val. (5) Lrq singularities in dimension $\geq 4$ are infinitesimally rigid. We classify lrq singularities in dimension $3$ that are not infinitesimally rigid and compute their deformation spaces. This generalises Schlessinger's rigidity theorem to positive and mixed characteristic. Finally, we study Riemenschneider's conjecture in this context, that is, whether lrq singularities deform to lrq singularities.</p></details>

We $p$-adically interpolate these Gan-Gross-Prasad period integrals as the Klingen Eisenstein series and the cuspidal automorphic form vary in Hida families. As a byproduct, we obtain a $p$-adic $L$-function of Rankin-Selberg type over $\mathrm{U}(m,n) \times \mathrm{U}(m+1, n)$. The ultimate motivation is to show the $p$-primitive property of Klingen Eisenstein series over unitary groups, by computing such Gan-Gross-Prasad period integrals, and this article is a starting point of this project. The $p$-primitivity of Eisenstein series is an essential property in the automorphic method in Iwasawa theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Allen, Grove, Long, and Tu proposed an explicit Hypergeometric-Modularity method which gives a concrete link between certain hypergeometric objects and modular forms. The theory is exemplified by a collection of 199 weight 3 modular forms. Among other properties their process shows that the $L$-value of such a modular form at 1 is an explicit multiple of a ${}_3F_2(1)$ hypergeometric series. Using the framework of a finite Coxeter group governing the invariance group of normalized ${}_3F_2(1)$ series, this paper fully classifies and describes the possible Hecke eigenforms whose $L$-values that can be obtained using this method. In addition, we determine when these modular forms differ by twist of a finite-order character using the perspective of hypergeometric functions. As one application, we reinterpret a classical identity of hypergeometric series as a formula involving $L$-values of two Hecke eigenforms that differ by a twist.</p></details>

The goal of this paper is to give an explicit description of the Aubert-Zelevinsky duality for $G$ in terms of Langlands parameters. We present a new algorithm, inspired by the Moeglin-Waldspurger algorithm for $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$, which computes the dual Langlands data in a recursive and combinatorial way. Our method is simple enough to be carried out by hand and provides a practical tool for explicit computations. Interestingly, the algorithm was discovered with the help of machine learning tools, guiding us toward patterns that led to its formulation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Rooted trees are essential for describing numerical schemes via the so-called B-series. They have also been used extensively in rough analysis for expanding solutions of singular Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs). When one considers scalar-valued equations, the most efficient combinatorial set is multi-indices. In this paper, we investigate the existence of intermediate combinatorial sets that will lie between multi-indices and rooted trees. We provide a negative result stating that there is no combinatorial set encoding elementary differentials in dimension $d\neq 1$, and compatible with the rooted trees and the multi-indices aside from the rooted trees. This does not close the debate of the existence of such combinatorial sets, but it shows that it cannot be obtained via a naive and natural approach.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We say that an abelian variety $A_{/\mathbf Q}$ of dimension $g$ is {\em prosaic} if it is semistable, with good reduction at 2 and its points of order $2$ generate a $2$-extension of ${\mathbf Q}$. For $p \equiv 1 \bmod{8}$, let $M_u$ be the maximal 2-primary unramified abelian extension of $K = {\mathbf Q}(\sqrt{-p})$ and let $h_2 =[M_u:K]$. We construct an indecomposable group scheme $\Xi_p$ over ${\mathbf Z}[\frac{1}{p}]$ of exponent 2 with field of points $M_u$. Assume that $A$ is prosaic, with bad reduction at only one prime $p$. Then $p \equiv 1 \bmod{8}$ and $A$ is totally toroidal at $p$. We prove that if End $A={\mathbf Z}$, then there is a ${\mathbf Q}$-isogenous abelian variety $B$ such that $B[2]$ is a subquotient of $\Xi_p$. We thereby show that $2g+2 \le h_2$ and $p$ has the form $a^2+16b^2$, with $a+4b \equiv \pm 1 \bmod{8}$. Moreover, if $2g + 4 \le h_2$, then $p$ has the form $a^2+64b^2$, with $a \equiv \pm 1 \bmod{8}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a non-Archimedean local field $F$ of residue cardinality $q=p^r$, we give an explicit classical generator $V$ for the bounded derived category $D_{fg}^b(\mathsf{H}_1(G))$ of finitely generated unipotent representations of $G=\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $l\neq p$. The generator $V$ has an explicit description that is much simpler than any known progenerator in the underived setting. This generalises a previous result of the author in the case where $n=2$ and $l$ is odd dividing $q+1$, and provides a triangulated equivalence between $D_{fg}^b(\mathsf{H}_1(G))$ and the category of perfect complexes over the dg algebra of dg endomorphisms of a projective resolution of $V$. This dg algebra can be thought of as a dg-enhanced Schur algebra. As an intermediate step, we also prove the analogous result for the case where $F$ is a finite field.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper applies the modular approach to obtain effectively computable bounds for Fermat-type equations over number fields, while also discussing the differences and obstructions that arise when considering such equations over totally real versus totally complex number fields. We use these techniques to study the generalized Fermat equation $d^ra^p+b^p+c^p=0$ over quadratic fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ of class number one. Extending the results of Freitas\&Siksek and Turcas, we show that when $d=-3,-11,3,5,7,11,13,19,23$, there is an effective and explicit bound, depending on the field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$, such that the latter equation does not have certain types of special solutions. In addition, we obtain effective bounds for $d=-19,-43$, showing that the same equation has no non-trivial solutions of this type. We also discuss, for $d=6,14,21$, the solutions of a variant of the above equation. Our results over imaginary quadratic fields are conjectural. Serre's modularity conjecture and an analogue of Eichler-Shimura over totally complex fields are assumed.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the generalised Knutson Index and compute it for the special linear groups and projective special linear groups of degree two by computing the lowest common multiple of the degrees of their irreducible representations. We also classify all alternating and symmetric groups such that the lowest common multiple of the degrees of their irreducible representations equals the order groups, which yields a lower bound on the generalised Knutson Indices of these groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $p>0$ a small parameter, let $\mathcal A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ be a random subset where each positive integer is included independently with probability $p$. We show that, with high probability (as $p \to 0$), the numerical semigroup $\langle\mathcal A\rangle:=\{a_1+\cdots+a_k: k \geq 0, a_1, \ldots, a_k \in \mathcal A\}$ generated by $\mathcal A$ has Frobenius number and genus of size $\asymp p^{-1}(\log p^{-1})^2$ and embedding dimension of size $\asymp (\log p^{-1})^2$. This resolves an open problem of Bogart and the second author.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A More Sums Than Differences (MSTD) set is a finite set of integers $A$ where the cardinality of its sumset, $A+A$, is greater than the cardinality of its difference set, $A-A$. We address a problem posed by Samuel Allen Alexander that asks whether there exists an infinite sequence of sets alternating between being MSTD and More Differences Than Sums (MDTS), where each set properly contains the previous. While a companion paper resolved this using `filling in' techniques, we solve the more challenging `non-filling-in' version, where any missing integer between a set's minimum and maximum elements remains missing in all subsequent sets.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We generalize the Hernandez-Jimbo category O of representations of Borel subalgebras of quantum affine algebras to the case of quantum loop algebras for arbitrary Kac-Moody g (as well as related algebras, such as quantum toroidal gl_1). Moreover, we give explicit realizations of all simple modules, and devise tools for the computation of q-characters that are new even for g of finite type. Our techniques allow us to generalize classic results of Frenkel-Hernandez, Frenkel-Mukhin, Hernandez-Jimbo and Hernandez-Leclerc, as well as prove conjectures of Feigin-Jimbo-Miwa-Mukhin and Mukhin-Young.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a natural number $k>1$, let $f_k(n)$ denote the number of distinct representations of a natural number $n$ of the form $p^k+q^k$ for primes $p,q$. We prove that, for all $k>1$, $$\limsup_{n\to\infty}f_k(n)=\infty.$$ This positively answers a conjecture of Erdos, which asks if there are natural numbers $n$ with arbitrarily many distinct representations of the form $p_1^k+p_2^k+\dots+p_k^k$ for primes $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_k$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Designing a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for factoring univariate polynomials over finite fields remains a notorious open problem. In this paper, we present an unconditional deterministic algorithm that takes as input an irreducible polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, and computes the factorisation of its reductions modulo $p$ for all primes $p$ up to a prescribed bound $N$. The \emph{average running time per prime} is polynomial in the size of the input and the degree of the splitting field of $f$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. In particular, if $f$ is Galois, we succeed in factoring in (amortised) deterministic polynomial time.</p></details>
