### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13691v1'>2511.13691</a>\]&nbsp; **Asymptotic error terms in Bonse-type inequalities**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Diego Marques, Pavel Trojovsky &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p_n$ denote the $n$-th prime. In 2000, Panaitopol established the inequality $p_1 \cdots p_n > p_{n+1}^{n - π(n)}$ for all $n \geq 2$, where $π(x)$ is the prime counting function. In 2021, Yang and Liao refined this by introducing the exponent $k(n,x) = n - π(n) + \frac{π(n)}{π(\log n)} - x \cdot π(π(n))$, proving the inequality holds for $x = 2$ and $n \geq 8$. In 2022, Marques and Trojovský extended this to $x = 1.4$ for $n \geq 21$ and conjectured its validity for $x = 0.1$ when $n \geq 24,154,953$. This paper confirms the conjecture by analyzing the error term $E_n(x) = \log(p_1 \cdots p_n) - k(n,x) \log p_{n+1}$. Also, we derive the asymptotic expansion to $E_n(x)$ demonstrating that it is positive for all sufficiently large $n$ when $x > -2$. For each $x > -2$, we identify a minimal integer $Ψ(x)$ such that $E_n(x) > 0$ for all $n \geq Ψ(x)$, precisely determining $Ψ(0.1) = 24,154,953$. Additionally, we establish effective upper bounds for $Ψ(x)$ both unconditionally and under the Riemann Hypothesis, with the conditional bounds showing a significant improvement. Our analysis fully resolves the conjecture and characterizes $Ψ(x)$ as a non-increasing, piecewise constant function, exhibiting discontinuities at a discrete set of threshold points. These results advance the understanding of Bonse-type inequalities and their asymptotic behavior.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Lior Bary-Soroker, Daniele Garzoni, Sasha Sodin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 22 pages v3: final version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Conditionally on the Riemann hypothesis for certain Dedekind zeta functions, we show that the characteristic polynomial of a class of random tridiagonal matrices of large dimension is irreducible, with probability exponentially close to one; moreover, its Galois group over the rational numbers is either the symmetric or the alternating group. This is the counterpart of the results of Breuillard--Varjú (for polynomials with independent coefficients), and with those of Eberhard and Ferber--Jain--Sah--Sawhney (for full random matrices). We also analyse a related class of random tridiagonal matrices for which the Galois group is much smaller.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The problem of finding short vectors in Euclidean lattices is a central hard problem in complexity theory. The case of module lattices (i.e., lattices which are also modules over a number ring) is of particular interest for cryptography and computational number theory. The hardness of finding short vectors in the asymptotic regime where the rank (as a module) is fixed is supporting the security of quantum-resistant cryptographic standards such as ML-DSA and ML-KEM. In this article we prove the average-case hardness of this problem for uniformly random module lattices (with respect to the natural invariant measure on the space of module lattices of any fixed rank). More specifically, we prove a polynomial-time worst-case to average-case self-reduction for the approximate Shortest Independent Vector Problem ($γ$-SIVP) where the average case is the (discretized) uniform distribution over module lattices, with a polynomially-bounded loss in the approximation factor, assuming the Extended Riemann Hypothesis. This result was previously known only in the rank-1 case (so-called ideal lattices). That proof critically relied on the fact that the space of ideal lattices is a compact group. In higher rank, the space is neither compact nor a group. Our main tool to overcome the resulting challenges is the theory of automorphic forms, which we use to prove a new quantitative rapid equidistribution result for random walks in the space of module lattices.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 38 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study Lie conformal algebroids (LCAd) and their representations using the language of lambda-brackets and Lie conformal algebras. We describe several general constructions, such as the LCAd of conformal derivations CDer(A) of a differential algebra A, the gauge LCAd G(A,M) associated to a differential algebra A and its module M, the current LCAd F^ of a Lie algebroid F, and the LCAd structure of the space Omega(V) of Kahler differentials over a Poisson vertex algebra (PVA) V. We develop the cohomology theories of LCAd and we relate them to the corresponding cohomology theories of PVA. In particular, we find an isomorphism between the cohomology of a PVA V with coefficients in a module M and the corresponding cohomology of the LCAd Omega(V) with coefficients in the same module.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The cyclotomic matrix is commonly used to arrange cyclotomic numbers in a convenient format. A natural question is whether the structure of the matrix can reflect properties of these numbers. In this article, we examine cyclotomic numbers through their associated cyclotomic matrix and reveal an algebraic structure by relating it to a basis element of a Schur ring. This viewpoint leads to structural identities and reinterpretations of classical results. As an application, we investigate the power difference set problem and establish conditions expressed through cyclotomic matrices, including spectral and determinant characterizations.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zhenhua Liu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Supersedes arXiv:2310.19860 and arXiv:2401.18074. Added a section on products of area-minimizing submanifolds no longer area-minimizing in general

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod n homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}$. As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod n homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected, area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated, and products of area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically area-minimizing. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10153v4'>2508.10153</a>\]&nbsp; **On $q$-Analogs of the $3x+1$ Dynamical System**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kenneth G. Monks &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages, 2 tables

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer $x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$ for $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps $x\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In particular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$. This seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the conjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any correspondence between polynomials and positive integers. In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend their domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that correspond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power series. We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\colon F_2[[q]]\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$ otherwise, where $A,B\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some of these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive integers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that $T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the orbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two fixed points. Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these conjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by replacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic integer. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could settle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for both $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f:\mathbb{A}^N\to\mathbb{A}^N$ be a regular endomorphism of algebraic degree $d\geq2$ (i.e., $f$ extends to an endomorphism on $\mathbb{P}^N$ of algebraic degree $d$) defined over a number field. We prove that if the set of $f$-preperiodic cyclotomic points is Zariski-dense in $\mathbb{A}^N$, then some iterate $f^{\circ l}$ ($l\geq1$) is a quotient of a surjective algebraic group endomorphism $g:\mathbb{G}_m^N\to\mathbb{G}_m^N$, over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. This is a higher-dimensional generalization of a theorem of Dvornicich and Zannier on cyclotomic preperiodic points of one-variable polynomials. In fact, we prove a much more general rigidity result for all dominant endomorphisms $f$ on an affine variety $X$ defined over a number field, regarding "almost $f$-invariant" Zariski-dense subsets of cyclotomic integral points. As applications, we also apply our results to backward orbits of regular endomorphisms on $\mathbb{A}^N$ of algebraic degree $d\geq2$, and to periodic points of automorphisms of Hénon type on $\mathbb{A}^N$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 64 pages. New hyperbolicity results added to the previous version (Theorem 1.5)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we introduce a class of `parabolic' subgroups for the generalized braid group associated to an arbitrary irreducible complex reflection group, which maps onto the collection of parabolic subgroups of the reflection group. Except for one case, which is proven separately elsewhere, we prove that this collection forms a lattice, so that intersections of parabolic subgroups are parabolic subgroups. In particular, every element admits a parabolic closure, which is the smallest parabolic subgroup containing it. We furthermore prove that it provides a simplicial complex which generalizes the curve complex of the usual braid group. In the case of real reflection groups, this complex generalizes the one previously introduced by Cumplido, Gebhardt, González-Meneses and Wiest for Artin groups of spherical type. We show that it shares similar properties, and similarly conjecture its hyperbolicity, with a few additional results in this direction.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** David W. Farmer &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Numerous small improvements based on referee comments. To appear in Bull AMS

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We examine published arguments which suggest that the Riemann Hypothesis may not be true. In each case we provide evidence to explain why the claimed argument does not provide a good reason to doubt the Riemann Hypothesis. The evidence we cite involves a mixture of theorems in analytic number theory, theorems in random matrix theory, and illustrative examples involving the characteristic polynomials of random unitary matrices. Similar evidence is provided for four mistaken notions which appear repeatedly in the literature concerning computations of the zeta-function. A fundamental question which underlies some of the arguments is: what does the graph of the Riemann zeta-function look like in a neighborhood of its largest values? We explore that question in detail and provide a survey of results on the relationship between L-functions and the characteristic polynomials of random matrices. We highlight the key role played by the emergent phenomenon of carrier waves, which arise from fluctuations in the density of zeros. The main point of this paper is that it is possible to understand some aspects of the zeta function at large heights, but the computation evidence is misleading.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Toshiyuki Kobayashi, Birgit Speh &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 50 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a new approach to symmetry breaking for pairs of real forms of $(GL(n, \mathbb{C}), GL(n-1, \mathbb{C}))$. Translation functors are powerful tools for studying families of representations of a single reductive group $G$. However, when applied to a pair of groups $G \supset G'$, they can significantly alter the nature of symmetry breaking between the representations of $G$ and $G'$, even within the same Weyl chamber of the direct product group $G \times G'$. We introduce the concept of "fences for the interleaving pattern", which provides a refinement of the usual notion of walls of Weyl chambers. We then establish a theorem stating that the multiplicity remains constant unless these "fences" are crossed, together with a new general vanishing theorem for symmetry breaking. These general results are illustrated with examples involving both tempered and non-tempered representations. In addition, we present a new non-vanishing theorem for period integrals for pairs of reductive symmetric spaces, which is further strengthened by this approach.</p></details>

We give the joint distribution of the positions of the second class particles and also the probability of there being a second class particle at a given site, under the natural blocking measure for ASEP. In order to find these distributions we use results about the number of particles in half-infinite and finite site ranges of ASEP. Our investigations also lead to probabilistic proofs of well-known combinatorial identities; the Durfee rectangles identity, Euler's identity, and the $q$-Binomial Theorem.</p></details>

The admissibility theorem of Harish-Chandra concerns the restrictions of irreducible representations to maximal compact subgroups.

We discuss how the recent representation-theoretic developments in these directions collectively offer a powerful method for the new spectral analysis of standard locally symmetric spaces, extending beyond the classical Riemannian setting.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2 adds acknowledgments and slightly strengthens some of the results; 17 pages + references

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A quantum graph $\mathcal{G}$ housed by a matrix algebra $M_n$ can be encoded as an operator system $\mathcal S=\mathcal{S}_{\mathcal{G}}\le M_n$. There are two sensible notions of quantum automorphism group for any such: $\mathrm{Qut}(\mathcal G)$, capturing the quantum symmetries of the adjacency matrix $A:M_n\to M_n$ attached to $\mathcal{G}$, and $\mathrm{Qut}(\mathcal S\le M_n)$, the quantum group acting universally on $M_n$ so as to preserve its $C^*$ structure, standard trace, and subspace $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$. The two quantum groups coincide classically, but diverge in general. We nevertheless show that both are generically trivial in the sense that they are so for $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$ ranging over a non-empty Zariski-open set under all reasonable dimensional constraints on $\dim \mathcal{S}$ and $n$. This extends analogous prior results by the first and third authors to the effect that classical symmetry groups of still-quantum graphs are generically trivial, and offers a fully quantum counterpart to the familiar probabilistic almost-rigidity of finite graphs. An auxiliary result sheds some light on the relationship between the two notions of quantum automorphism group, identifying the universal preserver of the quantum adjacency matrix of $\mathcal{G}$ with the quantum automorphism group not of $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$, but rather of the complex conjugate $\overline{\mathcal{S}}\le M_n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The twin prime conjecture asserts the existence of infinitely many pairs of prime numbers differing by two. In recent years, substantial progress has been made by several mathematicians toward this problem \cite{zhang2014bounded, pollack2014bounded, granville2016bounded, vatwani2017bounded}, yet a complete resolution remains elusive. This paper refines the application of weighted sieve techniques to address the conjecture. By analyzing a logarithmically weighted sum over prime pairs and establishing a strictly positive lower bound for its asymptotic behavior, we confirm the infinitude of twin primes within the analytic framework developed herein.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A partition is a $t$-core partition if $t$ is not one of its hook lengths. Let $c_t(N)$ be the number of $t$-core partitions of $N$. In 1999, Stanton conjectured $c_t(N) \le c_{t+1}(N)$ if $4 \le t \ne N-1$. This was proved for $t$ fixed and $N$ sufficiently large by Anderson, and for small values of $t$ by Kim and Rouse. In this paper, we prove Stanton's conjecture in general. Our approach is to find a saddle point asymptotic formula for $c_t(N)$, valid in all ranges of $t$ and $N$. This includes the known asymptotic formulas for $c_t(N)$ as special cases, and shows that the behavior of $c_t(N)$ depends on how $t^2$ compares in size to $N$. For example, our formula implies that if $t^2 = κN + o(t)$, then $c_t(N) = \frac{\exp\left(2π\sqrt{A N}\right)}{B N} (1 + o(1))$ for suitable constants $A$ and $B$ defined in terms of $κ$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** V2: Result and proof for abelian groups added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Raimi's theorem guarantees the existence of a partition of $\mathbb{N}$ into two parts with an unavoidable intersection property: for any finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, some color class intersects both parts infinitely many times, after an appropriate shift (translation). We establish a polynomial extension of this result, proving that such intersections persist under polynomial shifts in any dimension. Given non-constant polynomials $P^{(1)},\dots,P^{(f)}\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ with positive leading coefficients and $P^{(j)}(0)=0$, we construct a partition of $\mathbb{N}^k$ such that for any coloring of $\mathbb{N}^k$ with finitely many colors, there exist $x_0\in \mathbb{N}$ and a single color class that meets all partition pieces after shifts by $x_0+P^{(j)}(h)$ in each of the $k$ coordinate directions, for every $j$ and infinitely many values $h\in \mathbb{N}$. Our proof exploits Weyl's equidistribution theory, Pontryagin duality, and the structure of polynomial relation lattices. We also prove some finite analogues of the above results for abelian groups and $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We call an order $O$ in a quadratic field $K$ odd (resp. even) if its discriminant is an odd (resp. even) integer. We call an elliptic curve $E$ over the field $C$ of complex numbers with CM odd (resp. even) if its endomorphism ring $End(E)$ is an odd (resp. even) order in the corresponding imaginary quadratic field. Suppose that $j(E)$ is a real number and let us consider the set $J(R,E)$ of all $j(E')$ where $E'$ is any elliptic curve that enjoys the following properties. 1) $E'$ is isogenous to $E$; 2) $j(E')$ is a real number; 3) $E'$ has the same parity as $E$. We prove that the closure of $J(R,E)$ in the set $R$ of real numbers is the closed semi-infinite interval $(-\infty,1728]$ (resp. the whole $R$) if $E$ is odd (resp. even). This paper was inspired by a question of Jean-Louis Colliot-Thélène and Alena Pirutka about the distribution of $j$-invariants of certain elliptic curves of CM type.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define new objects called 'horizontal $p$-adic $L$-functions' associated to $L$-values of twists of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ by characters of $p$-power order and conductor prime to $p$. We study the fundamental properties of these objects and obtain applications to non-vanishing of finite order twists of central $L$-values, making progress toward conjectures of Goldfeld and David--Fearnley--Kisilevsky. For general elliptic curves $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ we obtain strong quantitative lower bounds on the number of non-vanishing central $L$-values of twists by Dirichlet characters of fixed order $d\equiv 2 \mod 4$ greater than two. We also obtain non-vanishing results for general $d$, including $d = 2$, under mild assumptions. In particular, for elliptic curves with $E[2](\mathbb{Q}) = 0$ we improve on the previously best known lower bounds on the number of non-vanishing $L$-values of quadratic twists due to Ono. Finally, we obtain results on simultaneous non-vanishing of twists of an arbitrary number of elliptic curves with applications to Diophantine stability.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The constant $π$ has fascinated scholars throughout the centuries, inspiring numerous formulas for its evaluation, such as infinite sums and continued fractions. Despite their individual significance, many of the underlying connections among formulas remain unknown, missing unifying theories that could unveil deeper understanding. The absence of a unifying theory reflects a broader challenge across math and science: knowledge is typically accumulated through isolated discoveries, while deeper connections often remain hidden. In this work, we present an automated framework for the unification of mathematical formulas. Our system combines Large Language Models (LLMs) for systematic formula harvesting, an LLM-code feedback loop for validation, and a novel symbolic algorithm for clustering and eventual unification. We demonstrate this methodology on the hallmark case of $π$, an ideal testing ground for symbolic unification. Applying this approach to 455,050 arXiv papers, we validate 385 distinct formulas for $π$ and prove relations between 360 (94%) of them, of which 166 (43%) can be derived from a single mathematical object - linking canonical formulas by Euler, Gauss, Brouncker, and newer ones from algorithmic discoveries by the Ramanujan Machine. Our method generalizes to other constants, including $e$, $ζ(3)$, and Catalan's constant, demonstrating the potential of AI-assisted mathematics to uncover hidden structures and unify knowledge across domains.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a connected, reductive group $G$ over a finite field endowed with a cocharacter $μ$, we define the zip cone of $(G,μ)$ as the cone of all possible weights of mod $p$ automorphic forms on the stack of $G$-zips. This cone is conjectured to coincide with the cone of weights of characteristic $p$ automorphic forms for Hodge-type Shimura varieties of good reduction. We prove in full generality that the cone of weights of characteristic $0$ automorphic forms is contained in the zip cone, which gives further evidence to this conjecture.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a generalized Floquet-Bloch theory for discrete torsion-free nilpotent groups by exploiting their Malcev completions. Our main result is a branching formula that relates finite-dimensional representations of a discrete nilpotent lattice to infinite-dimensional unitary representations of its simply connected nilpotent Lie group. This generalization enables to extend the following two classical asymptotic problems (i) a Chebotarev density analogue for prime closed geodesics on compact negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent covers, and (ii) long time asymptotic expansions of heat kernels on such coverings to the nilpotent setting. As a by-product, we derive a semi-classical expansion for the Harper operator, presenting an alternative to mathematical justification of Wilkinson's formula by Helffer-Sjöstrand. We conclude by proposing several avenues for future work: extensions to general hyperbolic flows and noncompact manifolds (in particular knot complements and related quasi-morphisms), connections to modified Riemann-Hilbert problems and opers. Furthermore, we give a brief comment on asymptotic behavior of knot invariants and infinite extensions in number theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbb Q$ be an elliptic curve and $p \geq 3$ a prime. The modular curve $X_E^-(p)$ parametrizes elliptic curves with $p$-torsion modules anti-symplectically isomorphic to $E[p]$. We give a complete classification of when $X_E^-(p)(\mathbb Q_\ell)$ is non-empty, for all primes $\ell\neq p$; our result also includes $\ell=p$ in most cases when $E$ is semistable at $p$. We give two different applications. First, we classify CM curves $E/\mathbb Q$ where the modular curve $X_E^-(p)$ is a counterexample to the Hasse principle for infinitely many $p$. Assuming the Frey--Mazur conjecture, we prove that for at least $60\%$ of rational elliptic curves $E$, the modular curve $X_E^-(p)$ is a counterexample to the Hasse principle for at least $50\%$ of primes $p$. Secondly, we introduce a new technique to the elimination stage of the modular method and apply it to show that $x^3+y^3=5^αz^p$ has no non-trivial primitive solutions for various primes $p$ satisfying $(α/p)=-1$. Moreover, as a by-product of our work, we simplify the assumptions of several local symplectic criteria due to the first author and Alain Kraus.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a finite field, and let $\mathbb{E}$ be either a quadratic field extension $E/F$ or the split algebra $F \oplus F$. We study distinguished representations of $\rm{SL}_{2n}(F)$ by the subgroup $H_{\flat} := \rm{SL}_{2n}(F) \cap \rm{GL}_{n}(\mathbb{E})$, which is a variation of the work of Anandavardhanan and Prasad on distinguished representations of $\rm{SL}_{n}(\mathbb{E})$ by the subgroup $\rm{SL}_n(F)$. This is in a similar framework of our earlier work of a $p$-adic non-split variation of Anandavardhanan-Prasad over finite fields. We give a formula for the dimension of the complex vector space $\rm{Hom}_{H_{\flat}}(π_{\flat}, 1)$ in terms of certain characters of $F^{\times}$, where $π_{\flat}$ is an irreducible representation which is also distinguished by $H_{\flat}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>One of the starting points of this work was the duality of Borcea relating standard level $k$ representations of $A_1^{(1)}$ and level $2k+1$ of $A_2^{(2)}$. For $k=1$ the combinatorial bases in both cases yield the two Capparelli identities and we wanted to see if there is a correspondence between the bases in terms of partitions for all $k\in\mathbb N$. By using the vertex operator relations in the principal picture for level $5$ standard $A_2^{(2)}$-modules we reduce a spanning set of Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt-type vectors in $L(5Λ_0)$ by removing the leading terms of relations and rendering a list of 34 ``difference'' conditions for partitions.We have with computer programs sorted out the sets of partitions satisfying these conditions and formed the partial generating series which agrees with the principally specialized character for all powers of $q$ up to $41$. Although our list of leading terms is incomplete, our results show that the corresponding combinatorial identity for $L_{A_2^{(2)}}(5Λ_0)$ drastically differs from the one for the Borcea dual $L_{A_1^{(1)}}(2Λ_0)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we classify the irreducible Harish-Chandra modules over the full toroidal Lie algebra, which is a natural higher-dimensional analogue of the affine-Virasoro algebra. In particular, we complete the classification of irreducible bounded modules, which were studied by Billig for non-zero level modules [Int. Math. Res. Not. 2006]. As a by-product, we also obtain the classification of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules over the higher-dimensional Virasoro algebra, which was introduced by Rao-Moody [Comm. Math. Phys. 1994], thereby generalizing the well-known result of O. Mathieu [Invent. Math. 1992] for the classical Virasoro algebra. More precisely, we show that any irreducible Harish-Chandra module over the higher-dimensional Virasoro algebra turns out to be either a quotient of a module of tensor fields on a torus or a highest weight type module up to a twist of an automorphism, as conjectured by Eswara Rao in 2004.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we consider irreducible quasi-finite (or equivalently weakly integrable) modules, with non-trivial action of the core, over the extended affine Lie algebras (EALAs) whose centerless cores are multiloop algebras. The centerless cores of all but one family of EALAs having nullity greater than 1 are known to admit such multiloop realizations. For any such (untwisted) EALA, we show that the irreducible quasi-finite modules are either integrable with the center of the underlying core acting trivially, or restricted generalized highest weight (GHW) modules. We further prove that in the nullity 2 case, these irreducible restricted GHW modules turn out to be highest weight type modules, thereby classifying the irreducible quasi-finite modules over all such EALAs. In particular, we obtain the classification of irreducible quasi-finite modules over toroidal Lie algebras, minimal EALAs and toroidal EALAs of nullity 2. Along the way, we completely classify the irreducible weakly integrable modules over affine Kac-Moody algebras (studied by Rao-Futorny [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 2009] for non-zero level modules). Our results generalize the well-known work of Chari [Invent. Math. 1986] and Chari-Pressley [Math. Ann. 1986] concerning the classification of irreducible integrable modules over (nullity 1) affine Kac-Moody algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra, $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ its quantum group, and $U_q(\mathfrak{k}) \subset U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ a quantum symmetric pair subalgebra determined by a Lie algebra automorphism $θ$. We introduce a category $W_θ$ of weight $U_q(\mathfrak{k})$-modules, which is acted on by the category of weight $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-modules via tensor products. We construct a universal tensor K-matrix $\mathbb{K}$ (that is, a solution of a reflection equation) in a completion of $U_q(\mathfrak{k}) \otimes U_q(\mathfrak{g})$. This yields a natural operator on any tensor product $M \otimes V$, where $M\in W_θ$ and $V\in {O}_θ$, that is $V$ is a $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-module in category ${O}$ satisfying an integrability property determined by $θ$. Canonically, $W_θ$ is equipped with a structure of a bimodule category over ${O}_θ$ and the action of $\mathbb{K}$ is encoded by a new categorical structure, which we call a boundary structure on $W_θ$. This generalizes a result of Kolb which describes a braided module structure on finite-dimensional $U_q(\mathfrak{k})$-modules when $\mathfrak{g}$ is finite-dimensional. We also consider our construction in the case of the category ${C}$ of finite-dimensional modules over a quantum affine algebra, providing the most comprehensive universal framework to date for large families of solutions of parameter-dependent reflection equations. In this case the tensor K-matrix gives rise to a formal Laurent series with a well-defined action on tensor products of any module in $W_θ$ and any module in ${C}$. This series can be normalized to an operator-valued rational function, which we call trigonometric tensor K-matrix, if both factors in the tensor product are in ${C}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite-dimensional algebra Λ, we establish an explicit bijection between widely generated torsion(-free) classes and semibricks in mod Λ. Using the kappa order on the lattice of torsion classes with canonical join representations, we provide several equivalent conditions for brick-finite algebras. We show that Λ is brick-finite if and only if any chain of wide subcategories of mod Λ becomes eventually constant, if and only if any torsion class in mod Λ has finitely many covers, if and only if every semibrick in mod Λ is a finite set. Thus, we give a proof of Enomoto's conjecture (Adv. Math., 393 (2021), 108113). As a consequence, we show that Λ is brick-finite if and only if every wide subcategory closed under coproducts of Mod Λ is closed under products, if and only if every wide subcategory of mod Λ is functorially finite. This gives a positive answer to the question posed by Angeleri Hügel and Sentieri (J. Algebra, 664 (2025), 164-205).</p></details>

For a non-Galois extension $L/K$ of prime degree, we relate the growth of the $\ell^{\infty}$-torsion subgroup of $E$ under the base change $L/K$ to the image of the mod-$\ell$ cyclotomic character. In particular, we refine Najman's result by ruling out certain torsion structures for cubic non-Galois extensions $L/\mathbb{Q}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider certain families of Hecke characters $φ$ over a quadratic imaginary field $F$. According to the Bloch-Beilinson conjectures, the order of vanishing of the $L$-function $L(φ,s)$ at the central point $s=-1$ should be equal to the dimension of the space of extensions of the Tate motive $\mathbb{Q}(1)$ by the motive associated with $φ$. In this article, we construct candidates for the corresponding extensions of Hodge structures, assuming that the sign of the functional equation of $L(φ,s)$ is $-1$. This is accomplished through the cohomology of variations of Hodge structures over Picard modular surfaces associated with $F$ and Harder's theory of Eisenstein cohomology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these extensions are naturally realized within certain biextensions. We outline a program to compute the biextension height and utilize it to establish the non-triviality of these extensions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Our goal in this paper is to introduce and study the Euler system of signed diagonal cycles associated with a trito-non-ordinary triple product of the form $f^B \times g^B \times \mathbf{h}^B$, where $f^B$ (resp. $g^B$) is a $p$-ordinary (resp. non-ordinary) eigenform on an indefinite quaternion algebra $B_{/\mathbb{Q}}$ of weight $2$, and $\mathbf{h}^B$ is a primitive Hida ($p$-ordinary) family. When $B=\mathrm{M}_2(\mathbb{Q})$ is split and $\mathbf{h}=\mathbf{h}^B$ has CM by an imaginary quadratic field, this allows us to develop the signed anticyclotomic Iwasawa theory for the base change $\mathrm{BC}_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(π_f)\times \mathrm{BC}_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(π_g)\times ψ$, where $ψ$ is a Hecke character of $K$. We formulate a signed Perrin-Riou-style Iwasawa main conjecture in this setting, and obtain a result on one inclusion in this conjecture. Our methods also allow us to extend Hsieh's construction of the balanced triple-product $p$-adic $L$-function to the trito-non-ordinary scenario, and to define its signed counterparts.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For smooth affine varieties in positive characteristic, we identify a slope obstruction to the injectivity of the comparison morphism from rigid cohomology to rationalised crystalline cohomology. This yields a negative answer to a question of Esnault--Kisin--Petrov concerning the injectivity of the de Rham-to-crystalline comparison map for smooth affine schemes over the Witt vectors that admit good compactifications. In contrast, we establish injectivity for certain subspaces defined by slope conditions as well as in cohomological degree one. For the latter case, we also prove the result with coefficients in $F$-able overholonomic $D$-modules leveraging a generalisation of Kedlaya's full faithfulness theorem. Beyond injectivity, we obtain various separation results for the affinoid topology on rigid and convergent cohomology. These results allow us to determine integral algebraic de Rham cohomology modulo torsion and to provide a more conceptual explanation for Ertl and Shiho's construction of varieties for which integral Monsky--Washnitzer cohomology modulo torsion is not finitely generated. Along the way, we prove a new integral comparison theorem between Monsky--Washnitzer cohomology and algebraic de Rham cohomology and we define fractional $p$-adic Tate twists, computing non-integral slopes of crystalline cohomology.</p></details>

The iHopf algebra on a Borel quantum group endowed with a $τ$-twisted Hopf pairing is shown to be a quasi-split universal iquantum group. In particular, the Drinfeld double quantum group is realized as the iHopf algebra on the double Borel. This iHopf approach allows us to develop connections between Lusztig's braid group action and ibraid group action. It will further lead to the construction of dual canonical basis in a sequel.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the $q$-deformation of rational numbers introduced recently by Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko. We propose three enumerative interpretations of these $q$-rationals: in terms of a new version of Ostrowski's numeration system for integers, in terms of order ideals of fence posets and in terms of perfect matchings of snake graphs. Contrary to previous results which are restricted to rational numbers greater than one, our interpretations work for all positive rational numbers and are based on a single combinatorial object for defining both the numerator and denominator. The proofs rest on order-preserving bijections between posets over these objects. We recover a formula for a $q$-analog of Markoff numbers. We also deduce a fourth interpretation given in terms of the integer points inside a polytope in $\mathbb{R}^k$ on both sides of a hyperplane where $k$ is the length of the continued fraction expansion.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a dual pair $(G, G')$, in the sense of Howe, with G compact acting on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$, for an appropriate $n$, via the Weil representation $ω$. Let $\tilde{\mathrm{G}}$ be the preimage of G in the metaplectic group. Given a genuine irreducible unitary representation $Π$ of $\tilde{\mathrm{G}}$, let $Π'$ be the corresponding irreducible unitary representation of $\tilde{\mathrm{G}'}$ in the Howe duality. The orthogonal projection onto $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)_Π$, the $Π$-isotypic component, is the essentially unique symmetry breaking operator in $\mathrm{Hom}_{\tilde{\mathrm{G}}\tilde{\mathrm{G}'}}(\mathcal{H}_ω^{\infty}, \mathcal{H}_Π^{\infty}\otimes \mathcal{H}_{Π'}^{\infty})$. We study this operator by computing its Weyl symbol. Our results allow us to recover the known list of highest weights of irreducible representations of $\tilde{\mathrm{G}}$ occurring in Howe's correspondence when the rank of $\tilde{\mathrm{G}}$ is strictly bigger than the rank of $\tilde{\mathrm{G'}}$. They also allow us to compute the wavefront set of $Π'$ by elementary means.</p></details>

This problem is known to be equivalent to determining the spectral radius of the Bell-CHSH operator. To approach this problem, we give a method to approximate orthogonal projections on V by those on finite dimensional subspaces. This method provides an upper bound and a lower bound for the spectral radius of [A,B], which become exact when the matrix representations of P and Q are "constant-angle one-shifted form".</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The fastest known algorithm for factoring a degree $n$ univariate polynomial over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ runs in time $O(n^{3/2 + o(1)}\text{polylog } q)$, and there is a reason to believe that the $3/2$ exponent represents a ''barrier'' inherent in algorithms that employ a so-called baby-steps-giant-steps strategy. In this paper, we propose a new strategy with the potential to overcome the $3/2$ barrier. In doing so we are led to a number-theoretic conjecture, one form of which is that there are sets $S, T$ of cardinality $n^β$, consisting of positive integers of magnitude at most $\exp(n^α)$, such that every integer $i \in [n]$ divides $s-t$ for some $s \in S, t \in T$. Achieving $α+ β\le 1 + o(1)$ is trivial; we show that achieving $α, β< 1/2$ (together with an assumption that $S, T$ are structured) implies an improvement to the exponent 3/2 for univariate polynomial factorization. Achieving $α= β= 1/3$ is best-possible and would imply an exponent 4/3 algorithm for univariate polynomial factorization. Interestingly, a second consequence would be a reduction of the current-best exponent for deterministic (exponential) algorithms for factoring integers, from $1/5$ to $1/6$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the \textit{Fibonacci Quarterly} in 1964, C.~R.~Wall gave the following weighted sum of generalized Fibonacci numbers: $\sum_{i=1}^n i G_i = n G_{n+2} - G_{n+3} + G_3$, where $\left(G_n\right)_{n \geq 0}$ is defined by the recurrence $G_n = G_{n-1} + G_{n-2}$ with fixed $G_0, G_1 \in \mathbb{Z}$. In this paper, we generalize Wall's result to the Lucas sequences of the first and second kind, $\left(U_n(p,q)\right)_{n \geq 0}$ and $\left(V_n(p,q)\right)_{n \geq 0}$, and give closed forms for $\sum_{i=1}^n i U_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n i V_i$ by using Abel's summation by parts method. Moreover, we provide concrete applications, not only recovering the known weighted sums $\sum_{i=1}^n i F_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n i L_i$ of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, respectively, but also add new identities to the literature for eight well-known sequences. In particular, we give closed forms for weighted sums of Lucas sequences of the first kind such as the Pell, balancing, Jacobstahl, and Mersenne numbers, and also Lucas sequences of the second kind such as the companion Pell, double Lucas-balancing, Jacobstahl-Lucas, and Mersenne-Lucas numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the representation theory of various convolution algebras attached to the $q$-deformation of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ from an algebraic perspective and beyond the unitary case. We show that many aspects of the classical representation theory of real semisimple groups can be transposed to this context. In particular, we prove an analogue of the Harish-Chandra isomorphism and we introduce an analogue of parabolic induction. We use these tools to classify the non-unitary irreducible representations of $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. Moreover, we explicitly show how they converge to the classical admissible dual of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. For that purpose, we define a version of the quantized universal enveloping algebra defined over the ring of analytic functions on $\mathbb{R}_+^*$, which specializes at $q = 1$ to the enveloping $\ast$-algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\{λ_f(n)\}_{n \geq 1}$ be the normalized Hecke eigenvalues of a given holomorphic cusp form $f$ of even weight $k$. We show under the assumption of the existence of Littlewood's type zero free region for $L(s, f, χ)$, where $χ$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $q$, that if $X^{2/3+\varepsilon} \ll H \ll X^{1-\varepsilon}$ with $\varepsilon>0$, then for any $A\geq 1$, $$\sum_{1\leq |h|\leq H}\bigg| \sum_{\substack{X<n,\: m \leq 2X \\ n - m = h}} λ_f(n)Λ(n)λ_f(m)Λ(m) \bigg|^2 \ll_{A} \frac{HX^2}{(\log X)^{A}}$$ holds. Moreover, under an additional hypothesis on the fourth moment of certain Dirichlet polynomials (which follows from GRH for $L(s, f)$), we show that the above result can be strengthened to hold in a wider range $X^{1/3+\varepsilon}\ll H \ll X^{1-\varepsilon}$. Finally, if we average over the forms $f$, then for $X^{\varepsilon}\ll H\ll X^{1-\varepsilon}$ and for any $A\geq 1$, $$ \sum_{f\in \mathcal{H}_k}ω_f\sum_{1\leq |h|\leq H}\bigg| \sum_{\substack{X<n,\: m \leq 2X \\ n - m = h}} λ_f(n)Λ(n)λ_f(m)Λ(m) \bigg|^2 \ll_{A}\frac{HX^2}{(\log X)^{A}},$$ where $\mathcal{H}_k$ is the Hecke basis for the space of holomorphic cusp forms of weight $k$ for the full modular group $\mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$ and $ω_f$ are harmonic weights associated with $f\in \mathcal{H}_k$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The universal $2$-parameter vertex algebra $W_{\infty}$ of type $W(2,3,4,\dots)$ serves as a classifying object for vertex algebras of type $W(2,3,\dots,N)$ for some $N$ in the sense that under mild hypothesis, all such vertex algebras arise as quotients of $W_{\infty}$. There is an $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ family of such $1$-parameter vertex algebras which, after tensoring with a Heisenberg algebra, are known as $Y$-algebras. They were introduced by Gaiotto and Rapčák and are expected to be the building blocks for all $W$-algebras in type $A$, i.e., every $W$-(super) algebra in type $A$ is an extension of a tensor product of finitely many $Y$-algebras. Similarly, the orthosymplectic $Y$-algebras are $1$-parameter quotients of a universal $2$-parameter vertex algebra $W^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$ of type $W(2,4,6,\dots)$, which is a classifying object for vertex algebras of type $W(2,4,\dots, 2N)$ for some $N$. Unlike type $A$, these algebras are not all the building blocks for $W$-algebras of types $B$, $C$, and $D$. In this paper, we construct a new universal $2$-parameter vertex algebra of type $W(1^3, 2, 3^3, 4, 5^3,6,\dots)$ which we denote by $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ since it contains a copy of the affine vertex algebra $V^k(\mathfrak{sp}_2)$. We identify $8$ infinite families of $1$-parameter quotients of $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ which are analogues of the $Y$-algebras. We regard $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ as a fundamental object on equal footing with $W_{\infty}$ and $W^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$, and we give some heuristic reasons for why we expect the $1$-parameter quotients of these three objects to be the building blocks for all $W$-algebras of classical types. Finally, we prove that $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ has many quotients which are strongly rational. This yields new examples of strongly rational $W$-superalgebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We initiate a program aimed at classifying thick ideals, Balmer spectra, and submodule categories of various stable categories of bimodules and modules for finite dimensional selfinjective algebras, and at clarifying the relationship between the universal Balmer support and the Hochschild cohomology support. In this paper, we focus mostly on the case of a unipotent Hopf algebra $A$. The stable category $\underline{\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\mathsf{env}})$ of $A$-bimodules that are projective as left and as right $A$-modules is a monoidal triangulated category under $\otimes_A$, and acts naturally on the stable category $\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A)$ of $A$. We show in this case that the Balmer spectrum $\mathsf{Spc}(\mathcal{E})$ of the thick subcategory ${\mathcal E}$ of $\underline{\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\mathsf{env}})$ generated by $A$ is homeomorphic to $\mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A))$ and defines an embedding $\mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A)) \to \mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A^{\mathsf{env}}))$. Subject to a conjectural description of spectra of finite tensor categories, we show that the spectrum of ${\mathcal E}$ is homeomorphic to ${\mathsf{Proj}}$ of the Hochschild cohomology ring of $A$, and that the Hochschild support coincides with the universal Balmer support. We show that any subcategory ${\mathcal K}$ of $\underline{\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\mathsf{env}})$ containing a thick generator admits a surjective continuous map from $\mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A))$. As a consequence, under the aforementioned conjecture, this spectrum is Noetherian, classifies the thick ideals of ${\mathcal K}$, and classifies thick ${\mathcal K}$-submodule categories of $\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A)$ via the Stevenson module-theoretic support. As examples, we present in detail the representations of finite $p$-groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a complex reductive group $G$ and a $G$-representation $\mathbf{N}$, there is an associated Coulomb branch algebra $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^\hbar$ defined by Braverman, Finkelberg and Nakajima. In this paper, we provide a new interpretation of $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^\hbar$ as the largest subspace of the equivariant Borel--Moore homology of the affine Grassmannian on which shift operators (and their deformations induced by flavour symmetries) are defined without localizations. The proofs of the main theorems involve showing that the defining equations of the Coulomb branch algebras reflect the properness of moduli spaces required for defining shift operators. As a main application, we give a very general definition of shift operators, and show that if $X$ is a smooth semiprojective variety equipped with a $G$-action, and $f \colon X \to \mathbf{N}$ is a $G$-equivariant proper holomorphic map, then the equivariant big quantum cohomology $QH^\bullet_G(X)$ defines a family of closed Lagrangians in the Coulomb branch $\mathrm{Spec}\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}$, yielding a transformation of 3d branes in 3d mirror symmetry. We further apply our construction to recover Teleman's gluing formula for Coulomb branches and to derive new generalizations of the Peterson isomorphism.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Ash, Grayson, and Green [J. Number Theory 19 (1984), pp. 412-436] compute the action of Hecke operators on a certain subspace of the cohomology of low-level congruence subgroups of $\mathsf{SL}(3, \mathbb{Z})$. This subspace contains the cuspidal cohomology, which is of primary interest. We extend their work, introducing a method that allows for computing the action of Hecke operators directly on the cuspidal cohomology. Using this method, we obtain data for prime level less than 3500, finding seven additional levels at which nonzero cuspidal classes appear and calculating local factors for five of these levels.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the structure of the vector space of Drinfeld quasi-modular forms for congruence subgroups. We provide representations as polynomials in the false Eisenstein series with coefficients in the space of Drinfeld modular forms (the $E$-expansion), and, whenever possible, as sums of hyperderivatives of Drinfeld modular forms. \\ Moreover, we introduce and study the double-slash operator, and use it to provide a well-posed definition for Hecke operators on Drinfeld quasi-modular forms. We characterize eigenforms and, for the special case of Hecke congruence subgroups $Γ_0(\mathfrak n)$, we give explicit formulas for the Hecke action on $E$-expansions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the generalized Hausdorff dimension of some natural subsets of $k^{-1}(3)$, where $k^{-1}(3)$ consists of the real numbers $x$ for which $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|<\frac{1}{(3+\varepsilon)q^2}$ has infinitely many rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$ for any $\varepsilon<0$ but only finitely many for any $\varepsilon>0$. It is well known that $k^{-1}(3)$ is an uncountable set with Hausdorff dimension zero. Given any dimension function $h$, we determine the exact "cut point" at which the generalized Hausdorff dimension $\mathcal{H}^h(k^{-1}(3))$ drops from infinity to zero. In particular we show that such a measure is always zero or not $σ$--finite, and, as an application, we can classify topologically $k^{-1}(3)$. Moreover, we show that the subset of attainable elements of $k^{-1}(3)$ has the same generalized Hausdorff dimension as $k^{-1}(3)$, but the subset of non--attainable elements of $k^{-1}(3)$ has a "strictly smaller" generalized Hausdorff dimension.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define a functor from the category of Lie conformal algebras to the category of differential Lie coalgebras, which associates to any Lie conformal algebra $L$ a differential Lie coalgebra $L^{\,0}$, defined as the maximal good $\mathbb{C}[\partial]$-submodule of the conformal dual $L^{*c}$. We show that the contravariant functor ${ }^{0}$ is right adjoint to the contravariant functor ${ }^{*c}$. We define the Loc functor from the category of differential Lie coalgebras to the category of locally finite differential Lie coalgebras, associating to any differential Lie coalgebra $M$ the differential Lie coalgebra Loc$(M)$, defined as the largest locally finite differential Lie subcoalgebra of $M$. We prove that for any Lie conformal algebra $L$ that is free as a $\mathbb{C}[\partial]$-module, Loc$(L^{0})$ is the set of conformal linear maps on $L$ whose kernel contains an ideal of $L$ of cofinite rank. In general, $L^{0}$ will not be locally finite, so $\mathrm{Loc}\left(L^{0}\right) \varsubsetneqq L^{0}$. We present an example illustrating this.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For the quiver Hecke algebra $R$, let $R\hbox{-gmod}$ be the category of finite-dimensional graded $R$-modules, and let $\widetilde{R\hbox{-gmod}[w]}$ be the localization of $R\hbox{-gmod}$. Kashiwara and the second author showed the set of equivalence classes of simple objects up to grading shifts $\mathrm{Irr}(\widetilde{R\hbox{-gmod}[w]})$ in $\widetilde{R\hbox{-gmod}[w]}$ has a crystal structure, and $\mathrm{Irr}(\widetilde{R\hbox{-gmod}[w]})$ is isomorphic to the so-called cellular crystal $\mathbb B_{\mathbf i}$. This isomorphism induces a function $\varepsilon_i^*$ on $\mathbb B_{\mathbf i}$. We give an explicit formula of $\varepsilon_i^*$, and using this formula, we give a characterization of the unit object of $\widetilde{R\hbox{-gmod}[w]}$ for the case of classical finite types.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For each prime number $p$ and each integer $g \geqslant 5$, we construct infinitely many abelian varieties of dimension $g$ over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$ satisfying the standard conjecture of Hodge type. The main tool is a recent theorem of Ancona on certain rank $2$ motives. These varieties are constructed explicitly through Honda-Tate theory. Moreover, they have Tate classes that are not generated by divisors nor liftable to characteristic zero. Also, we prove a result towards a classification of simple abelian varieties for which the result of Ancona can be applied to. Along the way, we prove results of independent interest about Honda-Tate theory and about multiplicative relations between algebraic integers.</p></details>
