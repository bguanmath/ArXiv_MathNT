 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Christopher Daw, Martin Orr, Georgios Papas &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 29 pages; preliminary draft; comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the Zilber-Pink conjecture for curves in $Y(1)^3$ that intersect a modular curve in the boundary. We also give an unconditional result for points having few places of supersingular reduction. Both results are proved using the G-function method for unlikely intersections.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Julien Boulanger, Rodolfo Gutiérrez-Romo, Erwan Lanneau &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix $g \geq 2$. Let $\mathsf{t}(g)$ be the maximal order of the translation group among all genus-$g$ abelian differentials. By work of Schlage-Puchta and Weitze-Schmith\"usen, $\mathsf{t}(g) \leq 4(g - 1)$. They also classify the $g$ attaining this bound. We assume $g$ is outside this class. We first prove that either $\mathsf{t}(g) = (2(m + 1) / m) (g - 1)$ for some $m \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, when regular genus-$g$ origamis exist, or $\mathsf{t}(g) = 2(g - 1)$, when they do not exist. In the former case, only some values of $m > 1$ are realizable; $m = 5$ is the smallest. The resulting set of genera, those satisfying $\mathsf{t}(g) = (12/5)(g - 1)$, contains infinitely long arithmetic progressions. The same holds for any odd prime $m$ congruent to $2$ modulo $3$. In the latter case, "many" strata of the form $\mathcal{H}(g - 1, g - 1)$, $\mathcal{H}(2k^q)$ or $\mathcal{H}(k^{2q})$, where $k \geq 1$ is an integer and $q$ is prime, contain no regular origamis; we derive a complete classification. As an application, we exhibit infinite families of genera $g$ for which $\mathsf{t}(g) = 2(g - 1)$: $g = p + 1$ for prime $p \geq 5$; $g = p^2 + 1$ for prime, but not Sophie Germain prime, $p$; and $g = pq + 1$, for distinct primes $p, q \geq 5$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the natural map from the syntomification of a ring $R$ to the stack of $R$-algebra stacks is fully faithful, answering a question of Drinfeld, and we describe its essential image in terms of underlying monoid stacks. We also give similar statements in the characteristic 0 filtered de Rham, $\ell = p$ \'etale, and Betti settings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we determine the motive of the classifying torsor of an algebraic torus. As a result, we give an exact sequence describing the degree 4 cohomological invariants of algebraic tori. Using results by Blinstein and Merkurjev, this provides a formula for the degree 4 unramified cohomology group of an algebraic torus, via a flasque resolution.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13412v3'>2308.13412</a>\]&nbsp; **$\hbar$-Vertex algebras and chiralization of star products**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Simone Castellan &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Exposition has been improved. The paper is now built on Huang's construction of the Zhu algebra. Minor mistakes in section 4 have been corrected

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop the theory of $\hbar$-vertex algebras, algebraic structures closely related to vertex algebras but with a deformed translation covariance axiom. We establish their structure theory, including analogues of Goddard's Uniqueness Theorem, the Reconstruction Theorem, Borcherds Identity, and the OPE Expansion Formula, and introduce the associated notions of $\hbar$-Lie conformal and $\hbar$-Poisson vertex algebras. The formalism provides a natural and simplified construction of the Zhu algebra. The main application is to the chiralization of classical star-products: we show that every star-product on the symmetric algebra of a Lie algebra (or its central extensions) admits a chiralization, and we derive explicit formulae for these chiral star-products, including the Moyal-Weyl and Gutt star-products. Setting $\hbar=0$ recovers explicit deformation quantizations of a broad class of Poisson vertex algebras, including the classical limits of free-boson, $\beta \gamma$-system, affine, and Virasoro vertex algebras.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $H$ be a coradically graded Hopf algebra. For every Loewy-graded exact $H$-comodule algebra $A=\oplus_{n\geq 0} A(n)$ and $H_0$-equivariant Morita equivalence $A(0)\simeq_{H_0} X$, there exists a Loewy-graded $H$-comodule algebra $B$ (isomorphic to $X$ in degree zero) realizing an $H$-equivariant Morita equivalence $A\simeq_H B$. In addition, if every exact $H_0$-comodule algebra is $H_0$-equivariant Morita equivalent to a coideal subalgebra of $H_0$, then every Loewy-graded exact $H$-comodule algebra is $H$-equivariant Morita equivalent to a coideal subalgebra of $H$. We also discuss Loewy-graded $H$-comodule algebras with $H_0=\mathcal{KP}$, the Kac-Paljutkin Hopf algebra.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hamid Ben Yakkou, Brahim Boudine, Pagdame Tiebekabe &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $m$ be a rational integer with $m \neq 0, \pm 1$, and consider the pure number field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{m})$ with $n \ge 3$. Most papers discussing the monogenity of pure number fields focus exclusively on the case where $m$ is square-free. For every integer $n \ge 4$, the monogenity of number fields of degree $n$ is not completely characterized. For example, the monogenity of the pure quartic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{m})$ is not yet fully described, even when $m$ is square-free (see the recent 2024 paper \cite{Nyul} by Arn\'oczki and Nyul). In this paper, based on a classical theorem of Ore concerning prime ideal decomposition in number fields \cite{MN92, O}, we study the monogenity of $K$ without assuming $m$ to be square-free. As an application, we present several examples related to canonical number systems (CNS). In particular, we observe that our results extend some of those presented in \cite{BFC, BF, HNHCNS}.</p></details>

> **Comment:** To appear in the Proceedings of the ICM 2026

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We survey three settings in which dimensions of intersection cohomology groups of algebraic varieties provide deep combinatorial and representation-theoretic information, and computations of the groups themselves have been made using combinatorial sheaves on finite posets. These settings are (1) intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and their realizations via moment graph sheaves and Soergel bimodules; (2) intersection cohomology of toric varieties, the associated g-polynomials of convex polytopes, and their realization via the theory of intersection cohomology of fans; and (3) intersection cohomology of arrangement Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of matroids, and their realization via intersection cohomology of matroids. In all three settings these constructions are valid in more general situations where the variety does not exist, leading to "intersection cohomology without spaces." We give parallel presentations of these three stories, highlighting applications to KLS-polynomials.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages, 2 figures. In this version some mistakes are corrected

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(G,+)$ be an Abelian group. Given $h\in \mathbb{Z}^+$, a non-empty subset $A$ of $G$ is called an $S_h$-set if all the sums of $h$ distinct elements of $A$ are different. We extend the concept of $S_h$-set to a more general context in the context of finite vectorial spaces over finite fields. More precisely, a $\emptyset \neq A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^r$ is called an $S_h$-linear set if all the linear combinations of $h$ elements of $A$ are different. We establish a correspondence between $q$-ary linear codes and $S_h$-linear sets. This connection allow us to find lower bounds for the maximum size of $S_h$-sets in $\mathbb{F}_q^r$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** David Ben-Zvi, David Nadler &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** submitted to proceedings of 2026 ICM

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and motivate -- based on ongoing joint work with Germ\'an Stefanich -- the notion of potent categorical representations of a complex reductive group $G$, specifically a conjectural Langlands correspondence identifying potent categorical representations of $G$ and its Langlands dual $\check G$. We emphasize the symplectic nature of potent categorical representations in their simultaneous dependence on parameters in maximal tori for $G$ and $\check G$, specifically how their conjectural Langlands correspondence fits within a 2-categorical Fourier transform. Our key tool to make various ideas precise is higher sheaf theory and its microlocalization, specifically a theory of ind-coherent sheaves of categories on stacks. The constructions are inspired by the physics of 3d mirror symmetry and S-duality on the one hand, and the theory of double affine Hecke algebras on the other. We also highlight further conjectures related to ongoing programs in and around geometric representation theory.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Axel Kleinschmidt, Hermann Nicolai &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** hep-th &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 22 pages. v2: minor modifications and updated references; JHEP version. v3: Eq. (3.11) corrected and explanations added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The involutory subalgebra K(E$_9$) of the affine Kac-Moody algebra E$_9$ was recently shown to admit an infinite sequence of unfaithful representations of ever increasing dimensions arXiv:2102.00870. We revisit these representations and describe their associated ideals in more detail, with particular emphasis on two chiral versions that can be constructed for each such representation. For every such unfaithful representation we show that the action of K(E$_9$) decomposes into a direct sum of two mutually commuting (`chiral' and `anti-chiral') parabolic algebras with Levi subalgebra $\mathfrak{so}(16)_+\,\oplus\,\mathfrak{so}(16)_-$. We also spell out the consistency conditions for uplifting such representations to unfaithful representations of K(E$_{10}$). From these results it is evident that the holonomy groups so far discussed in the literature are mere shadows (in a Platonic sense) of a much larger structure.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 67 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Casselman-Wallach theorem is a foundational result in the theory of representations of real reductive groups connecting algebraic representations to topological representations. We provide a quantitative version of this theorem. For that we introduce the notion of {\it Sobolev gap} for a Harish-Chandra module. This is a new invariant whose finiteness is highly non-trivial. We determine the Sobolev gap for representations in the unitary dual of the group $\SL(2,\R)$ and establish uniform finiteness results in general for representations of the discrete series and the minimal principal series. We use these notions to reformulate and extend classical results of Bernstein and Reznikov concerning automorphic functionals with respect to cocompact lattices. In particular, we prove an abstract convexity bound which applies to automorphic functionals with respect to general lattices in $\SL(2,\R)$ and is independent of the type of unitarizable irreducible Harish-Chandra module. Finally, we offer an extensive list of open problems.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v4. Improved the exposition. v3 We generalized the results of the old version from $n=2$ to any $n$. All comments and questions are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study the mixed Poincar\'e polynomial of generic $\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{C})$-character stacks with coefficients in some local systems arising from the conjugacy classes of $\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ which have non-connected stabiliser. We give a conjectural formula that we prove to be true under the Euler specialisation. We then prove that this conjectured formula interpolates the structure coefficients of the two based rings$ \left(\mathcal{C}(\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)),Loc(\mathrm{PGL}_n),*\right)$ and $\left(\mathcal{C}(\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)), CS(\mathrm{SL}_n),\cdot\right) $ where for a group $H$, $\mathcal{C}(H)$ denotes the space of complex valued class functions on $H$, $Loc(\mathrm{PGL}_n)$ denotes the basis of characteristic functions of intermediate extensions of equivariant local systems on conjugacy classes of $\mathrm{PGL}_n$ and $CS(\mathrm{SL}_n)$ the basis of characteristic functions of Lusztig's character-sheaves on $\mathrm{SL}_n$. Our result reminds us of a non-abelian Fourier transform.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 14 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $B$ be a totally-definite quaternion algebra over a totally real field $F$, let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime ideal of $F$, and let $\Gamma$ be the group of reduced norm-$1$ elements of an Eichler $\mathcal{O}_F[1/\mathfrak{p}]$-order $R$ inside $B$. We give an algorithm to compute the fundamental domain for the action of $\Gamma$ on the Bruhat-Tits tree of $\mathrm{GL}_2(F_\mathfrak{p})$. Using this, we tabulate Shimura curves of genus up to $3$ over any totally real field which can be $\mathfrak{p}$-adically uniformized for some prime $\mathfrak{p}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages. Accepted by Acta Arithmetica. The preprint arXiv:2406.15698 has been merged into this paper

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2022, Bergelson and Richter gave a new dynamical generalization of the prime number theorem by establishing an ergodic theorem along the number of prime factors of integers. They also showed that this generalization holds as well if the integers are restricted to be squarefree. In this paper, we present the concept of invariant averages under multiplications for arithmetic functions. Utilizing the properties of these invariant averages, we derive several ergodic theorems over squarefree numbers and squarefull numbers. These theorems have significant connections to the Erd\H{o}s-Kac Theorem, the Bergelson-Richter Theorem, and the Loyd Theorem.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 41 pages, 2 figures. Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define quantum deformations of Adams operations in $K$-theory, in the framework of quasimap quantum $K$-theory. They provide $K$-theoretic analogs of the quantum Steenrod operations from equivariant symplectic Gromov--Witten theory. We verify the compatibility of these operations with the Kahler and equivariant $q$-difference module structures, provide sample computations via $\mathbb{Z}/k$-equivariant localization, and identify them with $p$-curvature operators of the Kahler $q$-difference connections as studied in Koroteev-Smirnov. We also formulate and verify a $K$-theoretic quantum Hikita conjecture at roots of unity, and propose an indirect algebro-geometric definition of quantum Steenrod operations</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The concept of pseudo q-factorization graphs was recently introduced by the last two authors as a combinatorial language which is suited for capturing certain properties of Drinfeld polynomials. Using certain known representation theoretic facts about tensor products of Kirillov Reshetikhin modules and qcharacters, combined with special topological/combinatorial properties of the underlying q-factorization graphs, the last two authors showed that, for algebras of type A, modules associated to totally ordered graphs are prime, while those associated to trees are real. In this paper, we extend the latter result. We introduce the notions of strongly real modules and that of trees of modules satisfying certain properties. In particular, we can consider snake trees, i.e., trees formed from snake modules. Among other results, we show that a certain class of such generalized trees, which properly contains the snake trees, give rise to strongly real modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A character table $X$ for a saturated fusion system $\mathcal{F}$ on a finite $p$-group $S$ is the square matrix of values associated to a basis of virtual $\mathcal{F}$-stable ordinary characters of $S$. We investigate a conjecture of the second author which equates the $p$-part of $|\det(X)|^2$ with the product of the orders of $S$-centralisers of fully $\mathcal{F}$-centralised $\mathcal{F}$-class representatives. This statement is exactly column orthogonality for the character table of $S$ when $\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{F}_S(S)$. We prove the conjecture when $\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{F}_S(G)$ is realised by some finite group $G$ with Sylow $p$-subgroup $S$, and for all simple fusion systems when $|S| \le p^4$.</p></details>

We describe $3-$torsion points in terms of cubics which triply intersect the curve, and use this to define a system of equations whose solution set corresponds to the coefficients of these cubics. We compute the points of this zero-dimensional, degree $728$ scheme first by approximation, using homotopy continuation and Newton-Raphson, and then using continued fractions to obtain accurate expressions for these points. We describe how the Galois structure of the field of definition of the $3$-torsion subgroup can be used to compute local wild conductor exponents, including at $p=2$.</p></details>

We refine this study to include information on the Galois group in the simplest interesting case: $d = 3$. For curves of genus at least 5, we show cubic points with Galois group $C_3$ arise from well-structured morphisms, along with providing computable tests for the existence of such morphisms. We prove the same for curves of lower genus under some geometric or arithmetic assumptions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using the WZ method to prove supercongruences critically depends on an inspired WZ pair choice. This paper demonstrates a procedure for finding WZ pair candidates to prove a given supercongruence. When suitable WZ pairs are thus obtained, coupling them with the $p$-adic approximation of $\Gamma_p$ by Long and Ramakrishna enables uniform proofs for the Van Hamme supercongruences B.2, C.2, D.2, E.2, F.2, G.2, and H.2. This approach also yields the known extensions of G.2 modulo $p^4$, and of H.2 modulo $p^3$ when $p$ is $3$ modulo $4$. Finally, the Van Hamme supercongruence I.2 is shown to be a special case of the WZ method where Gosper's algorithm itself succeeds.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is known that for a curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ of genus $g \leq 4$, there exists a point on the curve defined over a solvable extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. We relate points on curves of genus $g \geq 5$ over solvable extensions to the Bombieri-Lang conjecture. Specifically, we show that varieties parametrising points defined over extensions with a fixed solvable Galois group are of general type. Moreover, we show the existence of certain subvarieties in these varieties imply the existence of solvable morphisms from the curve.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the field of characteristic two, $\mathbb F_2.$ Denote by $GL(q)$ the general linear group of rank $q$ over $\mathbb F_2.$ The algebraic transfer, introduced by W. Singer [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523], is a rather effective tool for unraveling the intricate structure of the (mod-2) cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr A}^{q,*}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2).$ The Kameko homomorphism is one of the useful tools to study the dimension of the domain of the Singer transfer. Singer conjectured that the algebraic transfer is always a monomorphism, but this remains open for all homology degrees $q\geq 5.$ In this paper, by constructing a novel algorithm implemented in the computer algebra system OSCAR for computing $GL(q)$-invariants of the kernel of the Kameko homomorphism, we disprove Singer's conjecture for bidegree $(6,6+36).$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A fruitful approach to studying the concentration of Laplace--Beltrami eigenfunctions on a compact manifold, as the eigenvalue tends to infinity, is to bound their restriction to submanifolds. In this paper, we adopt this approach in the setting of compact Lie groups and provide sharp restriction bounds for general Laplace--Beltrami eigenfunctions, as well as for important special cases such as sums of matrix coefficients and, in particular, characters of irreducible representations. We prove sharp asymptotic $L^p$ bounds for the restriction of general Laplace--Beltrami eigenfunctions to maximal flats and all of their submanifolds, for all $p \geq 2$. Furthermore, we establish sharp asymptotic $L^p$ bounds for the restriction of characters to maximal tori and all of their submanifolds for all $p>0$, and to torus-generated conjugation-invariant submanifolds for all $p \geq 2$. We also obtain sharp $L^p$ bounds for the restriction of general sums of matrix coefficients to maximal flats and all of their submanifolds, for all $p \geq 2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An explicit understanding of the (category of all smooth, complex) representations of p-adic groups provides an important tool not just within representation theory. It also has applications to number theory and other areas, and, in particular, it enables progress on various different forms of the Langlands program. In this write-up of the author's ECM 2024 colloquium-style talk, we will introduce p-adic groups and explain how the category of representations of p-adic groups decomposes into subcategories, called Bernstein blocks. We also provide an overview of what we know about the structure of these Bernstein blocks including a sketch of recent results of the author with Adler, Mishra and Ohara that allow to reduce a lot of problems about the (category of) representations of p-adic groups to problems about representations of finite groups of Lie type, where answers are often already known or are at least easier to achieve. Moreover, we provide an overview of what is known about the construction of supercuspidal representations, which are the building blocks of all smooth representations and whose construction is also the key to obtain the above results about the structure of the whole category of smooth representations. We will, in particular, focus on recent advances which include the work of the author mentioned in the EMS prize citation as well as a hint towards her recent joint work with David Schwein.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Kleshchev and Livesey proved the existence of RoCK $p$-blocks for double covers of symmetric and alternating groups over large enough coefficient rings. They proved that RoCK blocks of double covers are Morita equivalent to standard ``local" blocks via bimodules with endopermutation source. Based on this, Kleshchev and Livesey proved that these RoCK blocks are splendidly Rickard equivalent to their Brauer correspondents. The analogous result for blocks of symmetric groups, a theorem of Chuang and Kessar, was an important step in Chuang and Rouquier ultimately proving Brou\'e's abelian defect group conjecture for symmetric groups. In this paper we show that the Morita and splendid Rickard equivalences constructed by Kleshchev and Livesey descend to the ring $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p$-adic integers, hence prove Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'e's abelian defect group conjecture for these RoCK blocks.</p></details>

We find necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee the irreducibility of representations of type $\lambda_i$, $1\leq i\leq 5$, and we prove that representations of type $\lambda_i$, $6\leq i\leq 12$, are reducible. Regarding faithfulness, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for representations of type $\lambda_6$ or $\lambda_7$ to be faithful. Moreover, we give sufficient conditions for representations of type $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, or $\lambda_4$ to be unfaithful, and we show that representations of type $\lambda_i$, $i=3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12$ are unfaithful. We prove that any complex homogeneous local representations of the flat virtual braid group, $FVB_n$, into $GL_{n}(\mathbb{C})$, for $n\geq 2$, has one of the types $\gamma_i: FVB_n \rightarrow GL_n(\mathbb{C})$, $i=1, 2$. We then prove that representations of type $\gamma_1: FVB_n \rightarrow GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ are reducible for $n\geq 6$, while representations of type $\gamma_2: FVB_n \rightarrow GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ are reducible for $n\geq 3$. Then, we show that representations of type $\gamma_1$ are unfaithful for $n\geq 3$ and that representations of type $\gamma_2$ are unfaithful if $y=b$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Tensors are fundamental in mathematics, computer science, and physics. Their study through algebraic geometry and representation theory has proved very fruitful in the context of algebraic complexity theory and quantum information. In particular, moment polytopes have been understood to play a key role. In quantum information, moment polytopes (also known as entanglement polytopes) provide a framework for the single-particle quantum marginal problem and offer a geometric characterization of entanglement. In algebraic complexity, they underpin quantum functionals that capture asymptotic tensor relations. More recently, moment polytopes have also become foundational to the emerging field of scaling algorithms in computer science and optimization. Despite their fundamental role and interest from many angles, much is still unknown about these polytopes, and in particular for tensors beyond $\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$ and $\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$ only sporadically have they been computed. We give a new algorithm for computing moment polytopes of tensors (and in fact moment polytopes for the general class of reductive algebraic groups) based on a mathematical description by Franz (J. Lie Theory 2002). This algorithm enables us to compute moment polytopes of tensors of dimension an order of magnitude larger than previous methods, allowing us to compute with certainty, for the first time, all moment polytopes of tensors in $\mathbb{C}^3\otimes\mathbb{C}^3\otimes\mathbb{C}^3$, and with high probability those in $\mathbb{C}^4\otimes\mathbb{C}^4\otimes\mathbb{C}^4$ (which includes the $2\times 2$ matrix multiplication tensor). We discuss how these explicit moment polytopes have led to several new theoretical directions and results.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $S$ be a subset of $\overline{\mathbb Z}$, the ring of all algebraic integers. A polynomial $f \in \mathbb Q[X]$ is said to be integral-valued on $S$ if $f(s) \in \overline{\mathbb Z}$ for all $s \in S$. The set $\text{Int}_{\mathbb Q}(S,\overline{\mathbb Z})$ of all integral-valued polynomials on $S$ forms a subring of $\mathbb Q[X]$ containing $\mathbb Z[X]$. We say that $\text{Int}_{\mathbb Q}(S,\overline{\mathbb Z})$ is trivial if $\text{Int}_{\mathbb Q}(S,\overline{\mathbb Z}) = \mathbb Z[X]$, and nontrivial otherwise. We give a collection of necessary and sufficient conditions on $S$ in order $\text{Int}_{\mathbb Q}(S,\overline{\mathbb Z})$ to be nontrivial. Our characterizations involve, variously, topological conditions on $S$ with respect to fixed extensions of the $p$-adic valuations to $\overline{\mathbb Q}$; pseudo-monotone sequences contained in $S$; ramification indices and residue field degrees; and the polynomial closure of $S$ in $\overline{\mathbb Z}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Every word $w$ in $F_r$, the free group of rank $r$, induces a probability measure (the $w$-measure) on every finite group $G$, by substitution of random $G$-elements in the letters. This measure is determined by its Fourier coefficients: the $w$-expectations $E_w[\chi]$ of the irreducible characters of $G$. For every finite group $G$, every stable character $\chi$ of $G\wr S_n$ (trace of a finitely generated $FI_G$-module), and every word $w\in F_r$, we approximate $E_w[\chi]$ up to an error term of $O(n^{-\pi(w)})$, where $\pi(w)$ is the primitivity rank of $w$. This generalizes previous works by Puder, Hanany, Magee and the author. As an application we show that random Schreier graphs of representation-stable actions of $G\wr S_n$ are close-to-optimal expanders. The paper reveals a surprising relation between stable representation theory of wreath products and not-necessarily connected Stallings core graphs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unfolding singular points in linear differential equations is a classical technique for studying the properties of irregular singularities by relating them to regular singularities. In this paper, we propose a general framework for unfolding unramified irregular singularities of meromorphic connections on the trivial principal $G$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. One of our main results is the description of the unfolding of singularities in terms of deformations of their moduli spaces. We show that every moduli space of irreducible meromorphic $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ can be deformed into a moduli space of irreducible Fuchsian $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. Furthermore, we study the unfolding of additive Deligne-Simpson problems, in which the unfolding of irregular singularities naturally generates a family of such problems. As an application of our main result, we prove that a Deligne-Simpson problem for $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities admits a solution if and only if every unfolded Deligne-Simpson problem in the family admits a simultaneous solution. We also provide a combinatorial and diagrammatic framework of the unfolding process in terms of spectral types and unfolding diagrams. Finally, we address a conjecture proposed by Oshima concerning the existence of irreducible $G$-connections that realize prescribed spectral types and their unfoldings. Our main result gives an affirmative answer to this conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates Srinivasa Ramanujan's initial intuitive methodology for assigning the finite value -1/12 to the sum of the divergent infinite series of all positive integers. We systematically examine Ramanujan's initial method, originally sketched in his notebooks, and set the methodology into an algebraic framework. The methodology has limited applicability to other classes of divergent series. The methodology is extended to assign a Ramanujan smoothed sum to the infinite sequences of integers raised to a positive integer power and to figurate binomial number sequences, including triangular numbers, tetrahedral numbers, and higher-dimensional analogues, avoiding analytical continuation. A key finding establishes that the Ramanujan smoothed sums of figurate binomial sequences are intrinsically connected to logarithmic numbers (Gregory coefficients), providing a novel perspective on Ramanujan summation through the lens of classical combinatorial functions. The paper applies asymptotic expansions of associated rational generating functions to demonstrate consistency with established results from analytic continuation methods. The results illuminate the deeper mathematical structures underlying Ramanujan's intuitive insights and suggest new avenues for research in divergent series summation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There is consensus that sums $S_n={ {\Sigma }_{k=1}^n R_{0k} e^{i \theta_k}}$ of complex exponential terms, despite their mathematical significance, only possess closed-form representations for specific values of n and special values of their parameters and that there are no generally-accepted recursive formulae for their computation. This note is focused on recursive formulae that: (1) provide closed-form analytic representations of $S_n$ for any finite n; (2) include generalizations of the usual formula for the sum of two exponentials; and (3) are representable in the form $S_n= A_n exp({ i\Sigma_{k=1}^n \theta_k})$. The goal of the paper is to show that one may interpret the exponential term $exp(i \Sigma_{k=1}^n \theta_k)$ of $S_n$ as representing the projection, from a field of numbers that generalizes the complex numbers onto the complex plane, of a term representing quantities that are conserved under the addition and multiplication of numbers in the extended space. In particular, it is shown that the general form of a number in the extended field generalizes the form of a sum of complex exponentials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a subset $\mathcal{S}\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ and fixed $n,m\in \mathbb{N}$, one can study the distribution of the value of the smallest denominator $Q\in \mathcal{S}$, for which there exists $\mathbf{P}\in \mathbb{F}_q[x]^m$ such that $\frac{P}{Q}\in B(\boldsymbol{\alpha},q^{-n})$, where $Q\in \mathcal{S}$. On the other hand, one can study the discrete analogue, when $N\in \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ is a polynomial with $\deg(N)=n$ and $\boldsymbol{\alpha}\in \frac{1}{N}\mathbb{F}_q[x]^m$ as a discrete probability distribution function. We prove that for any infinite subset $\mathcal{S}\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q[x]$, for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$, and for any dimension $m$, the probability distribution functions of both these random variables are equal to one another. This is significantly stronger than the real setting, where Balazard and Martin proved that these functions have asymptotically close averages, when there are no restrictions on the denominators.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unlike the Hochschild chain complex of an algebra, the Hochschild cochain complex of an algebra is not functorial. Nonetheless, we show that the Hochschild cochain complex of an algebra even a dg category is of lax functoriality, i.e., there exists a lax functor from bicategory of dg categories to bicategory of $B_\infty$-algebras which sends every dg category to its Hochschild cochain complex. This result is a homotopy version of the lax functoriality of center of an algebra obtained by Davydov, Kong, Runkel, Grady, Oren, et al, in the more general context of dg categories, and extends the restricted functoriality of Hochschild cochain complex of a dg category obtained by Keller to global lax functoriality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent years, there has been extensive work on inequalities among partition functions. In particular, Nicolas, and independently DeSalvo--Pak, proved that the partition function $p(n)$ is eventually log-concave. Inspired by this and other results, Chern--Fu--Tang first conjectured log-concavity of $k$-coloured partitions. Three of the authors and Tripp later proved this conjecture by introducing recursive sequences and a strict inequality for fractional partition functions, giving explicit errors. In this paper, we show that the log-concavity is, in fact, strict for $k\geq 2$. We shed further light on this phenomenon by utilizing Hardy--Littlewood--P\'olya's notion of majorizing. We prove that for partitions $\bm{a},\bm{b}$ of $n\in\N$, if $\bm b$ majorizes $\bm a$, then $p_k(\bm{b})>p_k(\bm{a})$. Numerical calculations indicate that our result is sharp.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any ${\rm E}$-rigid presentation $e$, we construct an orthogonal projection functor to ${\rm rep}(e^\perp)$ left adjoint to the natural embedding. We establish a bijection between presentations in ${\rm rep}(e^\perp)$ and presentations compatible with $e$. For quivers with potentials, we show that ${\rm rep}(e^\perp)$ forms a module category of another quiver with potential. We derive mutation formulas for the $\delta$-vectors of positive and negative complements and the dimension vectors of simple modules in ${\rm rep}(e^\perp)$, enabling an algorithm to find the projected quiver with potential. Additionally, we introduce a modified projection for quivers with potentials that preserves general presentations. For applications to cluster algebras, we establish a connection to the stabilization functors.</p></details>

In so doing, we need to understand certain phantom oversized terms, which allow us to extract the right off-diagonal contributions. We further need to resolve the combinatorial problem that arises when matching our main terms with random matrix predictions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study ancilla-free approximation of single-qubit unitaries $U\in {\rm SU}(2)$ by gate sequences over Clifford+$G$, where $G\in\{T,V\}$ or their generalization. Let $p$ denote the characteristic factor of the gate set (e.g., $p=2$ for $G=T$ and $p=5$ for $G=V$). We prove three asymptotic bounds on the minimum $G$-count required to achieve approximation error at most $\varepsilon$. First, for Haar-almost every $U$, we show that $3\log_{p}(1/\varepsilon)$ $G$-count is both necessary and sufficient; moreover, probabilistic synthesis improves the leading constant to $3/2$. Second, for unitaries whose ratio of matrix elements lies in a specified number field, $4\log_p(1/\varepsilon)$ $G$-count is necessary. Again, the leading constant can be improved to $2$ by probabilistic synthesis. Third, there exist unitaries for which the $G$-count per $\log_{p}(1/\varepsilon)$ fails to converge as $\varepsilon\to 0^+$. These results partially resolve a generalized form of the Ross--Selinger conjecture.</p></details>

First we show that for $b\geq 26000$, there exists infinitely many primes $p$ such that $\overleftarrow{p}$ is square-free. Further, we show that for $b\geq 2$ there are infinitely many palindromes (with $n=\overleftarrow{n}$) that are cube-free. We also give asymptotic expressions for the counting functions corresponding to these results. The main tools we use are recent bounds from the literature on reversed primes and palindromes in arithmetic progressions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2013, Darryl McCullough and Marcus Wanderley made a series of conjectures that describe the Nielsen equivalence classes and $T_2$-equivalence classes of pairs of generators for $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and the Markoff equivalence classes of triples in $\mathbb{F}_q^3$ that solve $x^2+y^2+z^2=xyz+\kappa$ for some $\kappa\in\mathbb{F}_q$. (The case $\kappa=0$ was originally conjectured by Baragar in 1991.) We prove that one of the McCullough--Wanderley conjectures, the ``$Q$-classification conjecture" on Markoff triples, implies the others. Then we prove that the $Q$-classification conjecture holds if $q=p$ is a prime such that $27720$ does not divide $p^2-1$. More generally, for any integer $d$, we reduce the $Q$-classification conjecture for all primes $p\not\equiv \pm 1\,\text{mod}\,d$ to checking whether a roughly $2d\times 2d$ matrix with entries in $\mathbb{Q}[\kappa]$ is invertible. We (and SageMath) perform this invertibility check for $d=5$, 7, 8, 9, and 11, hence the modulus $27720=\text{lcm}(1,\dots,11)$.</p></details>

This provides a unified algebraic, combinatorial, and computational approach that applies to ideals of interest, old and new. The theory concerns ideals in the coordinate ring of matrices, stable under the action of some Levi group, whose quotients admit standard bases equipped with a crystal structure. We construct an effective algorithm to decide if an ideal is bicrystalline. When the answer is affirmative, we provide a uniform, generalized Littlewood-Richardson rule for computing the multiplicity of irreducible representations either for the quotient or the ideal itself.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $C$ be a curve of genus $g \geq 2$, and let $J$ be its Jacobian. The choice of a degree 1 divisor $e$ on $C$ gives an embedding of $C$ into $J$; we denote by $[C]_{}^{e}\in \mathrm{CH}\left( J;\mathbb{Q} \right) $ the class in the Chow group of $J$ defined by the image of this embedding. It is known from the work of S.-W. Zhang that the vanishing of the Ceresa cycle $\mathrm{Cer}(C,e):=[C]^{e} - [-1]_* [C]^e$ is equivalent to both the vanishing of the 1st Beauville component $[C]_{(1)}^e$ and the vanishing of the 3rd Gross--Kudla--Schoen modified diagonal cycle $\Gamma^3(C,e) \in \mathrm{CH}(C^3;\mathbb{Q})$. In this paper, we extend this result to show that the vanishing of the $s$-th Beauville component $[C]^e_{(s)}$ for $s \geq 1$ is equivalent to the vanishing of the $(s+2)$-nd modified diagonal cycle $\Gamma^{s + 2}(C, e) \in \mathrm{CH}(C^{s+2};\mathbb{Q})$. We also establish "successive vanishing" results for these cycles: for instance, if $\Gamma^n(C, e) = \Gamma^{n + 1}(C, e)=0$, then $\Gamma^{k}(C, e) = 0$ for all $k \geq n$. In the $s=1$ case, we show an integral refinement to the original statement, relating the order of torsion of $\mathrm{Cer}(C,e) \in \mathrm{CH}(J;\mathbb{Z})$ to that of $\Gamma^3(C,e) \in \mathrm{CH}(C^3;\mathbb{Z})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the $K$-theoretic enumerative geometry of cyclic Nakajima quiver varieties, with particular focus on $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$, the equivariant Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$. The direct sum over $m$ of the equivariant $K$-theories of these varieties is known to be isomorphic to the ring symmetric functions in $l$ colors, with structure sheaves of torus fixed points identified with wreath Macdonald polynomials. Using properties of wreath Macdonald polynomials and the recent identification of the Maulik-Okounkov quantum affine algebra for cyclic quivers with the quantum toroidal algebras of type $A$, we derive an explicit formula for the generating function of capped vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$ with descendants given by exterior powers of the $0$th tautological bundle. We also sharpen the large framing vanishing results of Okounkov, providing a class of descendants and cyclic quiver varieties for which the capped vertex functions are purely classical. Our results also suggest certain integrality and wall-crossing conjectures for capped vertex functions.</p></details>

First we show that if an algebra $A$ is Iwanaga-Gorenstein of Gorenstein dimension 1 then its stable category is generated under extensions by its radical $\text{rad}\,A$. Next, for a 2-Calabi-Yau tilted algebra $A$ we provide an explicit relationship between the $\underline{\text{CMP}}$ category of $A$ and its quotient $A/Ae_iA$ by an ideal generated by an idempotent $e_i$. Consequently, we obtain various equivalent characterizations of when the $\underline{\text{CMP}}$ category remains the same after passing to the quotient.

We derive explicit formulas for the stabilized dimensions and, in particular, obtain stabilization of the coefficients of Kac polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For the group GL(n), we construct an action of the equivariant derived category of coherent sheaves on the Grothendieck-Springer resolution on a certain subcategory of a finite monodromic Hecke category. We use this to construct a partial categorification of the projection from the extened affine to the finite Hecke algebra of GL(n). As a crucial intermediate step, we compute the exterior powers, with respect to the perversely truncated multiplicative convolution, of a parabolic Springer sheaf corresponding to a maximal parabolic subgroup fixing a line in the defining n-dimensional representation of GL(n).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a multidimensional generalization of Zeckendorf's Theorem (any positive integer can be written uniquely as a sum of non-adjacent Fibonacci numbers) to a large family of linear recurrences. This extends work of Anderson and Bicknell-Johnson in the multi-dimensional case when the underlying recurrence is the same as the Fibonacci one. Our extension applies to linear recurrence relations defined by vectors $\vec{\mathbf{c}} = (c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k)$ such that $c_1\geq c_2\geq\cdots \geq c_k$ and where $c_k = 1$. Under these conditions, we prove that every integer vector in $\mathbb{Z}^{k-1}$ admits a unique $\vec{\mathbf{c}}$-satisfying representation ($\vec{\mathbf{c}}$-SR) as a linear combination of vectors, $(\vec{\mathbf{X}}_n)_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}$ defined for every $n\in \mathbb{Z}$ by initially by zero and standard unit vectors and then the recursion $$\vec{\mathbf{X}}_{n} := c_1\vec{\mathbf{X}}_{n -1} + c_2\vec{\mathbf{X}}_{n - 2} + \cdots + c_k\vec{\mathbf{X}}_{n-k}.$$ To establish this, we introduce carrying and borrowing operations that use the defining recursion to transform any $\vec{\mathbf{c}}$ representation into a $\vec{\mathbf{c}}$-SR while preserving the underlying vector. Then, by establishing bijections with properties of scalar Positive Linear Recurrence Sequences (PLRS), we prove that these multidimensional decompositions inherit various properties, such as the number of summands exhibits Gaussian behavior and summand minimality of $\vec{\mathbf{c}}$-SRs over all all $\vec{\mathbf{c}}$-representations.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages. This version adds a reference to a paper of Hindry for a result which we previously only attributed to Harris--Silverman. It also removes a theorem we previously used but found to be incorrect, and replaces all prior instances of its use with other methods which already appeared elsewhere in the paper so that none of our main results are affected

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We work towards completely classifying all bielliptic Shimura curves $X_0^D(N)$ with nontrivial level $N$ coprime to $D$, extending a result of Rotger that provided such a classification for level one. Combined with prior work, this allows us to determine the list of all relatively prime pairs $(D,N)$ for which $X_0^D(N)$ has infinitely many degree $2$ points. As an application, we use these results to make progress on determining which curves $X_0^D(N)$ have sporadic points. Using tools similar to those that appear in this study, we also determine all of the geometrically trigonal Shimura curves $X_0^D(N)$ with $\gcd(D,N)=1$ (none of which are trigonal over $\mathbb{Q}$).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article develops the theory of fusion categories acting on algebras. We will demonstrate that weak Hopf algebra actions on algebras correspond to specific actions of fusion categories. As an application of this theory, we introduce a family of filtered actions of weak Hopf algebras on the path algebra, and for weak Hopf algebras whose representation categories are equivalent to $\text{PSU(2)}_{p-2}$, we describe all of the separable based fusion category actions in terms of weak Hopf algebra actions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Corrects minor errors related to Schur's recurrence relations

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1975, G. E. Andrews challenged the mathematics community to address L. Ehrenpreis' problem, which was to directly prove the modularity of the Rogers-Ramanujan $q$-series' summatory forms. This question is important because many different $q$-series appearing in combinatorics, representation theory, and physics often seem to be "mysteriously" modular, yet there is no general test to confirm this directly from the exotic $q$-series expressions. In this note, we solve this general problem using $q$-series algebra and $q$-series systems of differential equations. Specifically, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which a vector of holomorphic $q$-series on $|q|<1$ forms a vector-valued modular function. This result offers a clear and conceptual path to modularity for "strange" $q$-series.</p></details>
