### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04489v2'>2504.04489</a>\]&nbsp; **Paper BOAT**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Federico Castillo, Damian de la Fuente, Nicolas Libedinsky, David Plaza &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 36 pages, 7 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We derive a formula for computing the size of lower Bruhat intervals for elements in the dominant cone of an affine Weyl group of type $A$. This enumeration problem is reduced to counting lattice points in certain polyhedra. Our main tool is a decomposition -- or tiling -- of each interval into smaller, combinatorially tractable pieces, which we call paper boats. We also conjecture a generalization of this formula to all affine Weyl groups, restricted to elements in the lowest two-sided Kazhdan-Lusztig cell, which contains almost all of the elements.</p></details>

> **Comment:** To appear in Proceedings of Symposia in Pure Mathematics

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The aim of these notes is to give an overview of several aspects of what has come to be called the relative Langlands program, a theme that takes its origin in the study of automorphic periods and their relations to particular cases of Langlands functoriality and special values of (automorphic) $L$-functions. Following the work of Sakellaridis and Sakellaridis-Venkatesh, we emphasize the unifying role played by spherical varieties and harmonic analysis on them. We also review various instances of the phenomena, discovered by Jacquet, Gan-Gross-Prasad, Ichino-Ikeda and many others, that motivated these developments.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we consider Hecke triangle groups $\Gamma_w$ for $w>2$ and associated infinite-volume orbifolds $\Gamma_w \backslash \mathbb{H}$. We show that the Selberg zeta function $Z_{\Gamma_w}(s)$ can be approximated for $s \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \frac{1}{2}(1-2 \mathbb{N}_0)$ by determinants of finite-dimensional matrices with an explicitly computed error term that decays exponentially as the matrix size increases. As an application, we evaluate the Hausdorff dimensions of Hecke triangle groups with high precision, explicitly compute the values of the corresponding Ruelle zeta functions at zero, and obtain estimates on orders of trivial zeroes of the Selberg zeta function.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17935v1'>2509.17935</a>\]&nbsp; **A converse theorem for hyperbolic surface spectra and the conformal bootstrap**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Anshul Adve &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.SP &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 109 pages, 1 figure. Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The conformal bootstrap in physics has recently been adapted to prove remarkably sharp estimates on Laplace eigenvalues and triple correlations of automorphic forms on compact hyperbolic surfaces. These estimates derive from an infinite family of algebraic equations satisfied by this spectral data. The equations encode $G$-equivariance and associativity of multiplication on $\Gamma \backslash G$, for $\Gamma$ a cocompact lattice in $G = \text{PSL}_2(\mathbf{R})$. The effectiveness of the conformal bootstrap suggests that the equations characterize hyperbolic surface spectra, i.e., that every solution to the equations comes from a compact hyperbolic surface. This paper proves this rigorously with no analytic assumptions on the solution except discreteness of the spectrum. The key intermediate result is an axiomatic characterization of representations of $G$ of the form $L^2(\Gamma \backslash G)$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** José Figueroa-O'Farrill, Emil Have, Niels A. Obers &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** hep-th &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 47 pages, 1 appendix; v2: updated references and fixed typos

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a recently discovered carrollian bosonic string, described classically by a sigma model where both the worldsheet and the target spacetime are carrollian. After fixing the carrollian analogue of the conformal gauge, we determine the Lie algebra of residual gauge symmetries and show it is isomorphic to the three-dimensional extended BMS algebra. We quantise the sigma model \`a la BRST and determine the spectrum of the corresponding string theory by computing the BRST cohomology. In contrast with the usual bosonic string, the spectrum of the carrollian string is finite-dimensional. The cohomology displays Poincar\'e duality and can be interpreted, for a given momentum, as inducing representations for unitary irreducible representations of the 26-dimensional Carroll group. Furthermore we interpret (most of) the cohomology as deformations of the spacetime carrollian structure augmented by the Kalb--Ramond field to which the carrollian string couples.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17922v1'>2509.17922</a>\]&nbsp; **Construction of $d$-abelian categories via derived categories**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Peter Jorgensen, Emre Sen &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 33 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we provide a simple way to construct $d$-abelian categories via bounded derived categories for certain values of $d$. Namely, let ${\mathcal C}$ be an abelian category, and let ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ denote the full subcategory of the bounded derived category of ${\mathcal C}$ whose objects $X$ satisfy that $H_*(X)$ is concentrated in degrees $j$ where $0 \leq j \leq m$. We prove that if ${\mathcal C}$ is hereditary, then ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ is a $d$-abelian category where $d = 3m + 1$. Beyond offering a uniform method for constructing $d$-abelian categories, this construction allows us to create $d$-abelian categories that exhibit some unexpected properties depending on the choice of the category ${\mathcal C}$. For instance, if ${\mathcal C}$ is the category of abelian groups, then ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ is a $d$-abelian category which is not $\mathbb{K}$-linear over a field $\mathbb{K}$ but has set indexed products and coproducts. Similarly, if ${\mathcal C}$ is the category of coherent sheaves over certain algebraic curves, then ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ is a $d$-abelian category without enough injectives. We extend our results to $(n+2)$-angulated categories. Namely, let $M$ be an $n$-cluster tilting object over an $n$-representation finite algebra and let ${\mathcal T}$ be the corresponding $(n+2)$-angulated category with $n$-suspension functor $\Sigma_n$. We prove that the full subcategory ${\mathcal T}[0,m] = \mathrm{add} \bigoplus^{m}_{j=0}\Sigma^j_n M$ is a $d$-abelian category where $d = (n+2)(m+1)-2$. Furthermore, we show that there is a bijection between the functorially finite wide subcategories of $\mathrm{add}\,M$ and the functorially finite repetitive wide subcategories of ${\mathcal T}[0,m]$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08907v4'>2308.08907</a>\]&nbsp; **On $p$-adic denseness of quotients of values of integral forms**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Deepa Antony, Rupam Barman, Stevan Gajović, Daniel Širola &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$, the ratio set or the quotient set of $A$ is defined by $R(A):=\{a/b: a, b\in A, b\neq 0\}$. It is an open problem to study the denseness of $R(A)$ in the $p$-adic numbers when $A$ is the set of values attained by an integral form. In this paper, we consider the question of whether this happens for all but finitely many $p$. We prove that if a form is non-singular and has at least three variables, then the ratio set of its values is dense in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for all sufficiently large $p$. We conjecture that the same statement is true for non-degenerate forms of prime degree having sufficiently many variables, which is indeed the case when the degree is 2, 3, or 5. Still, we give two counterexamples when the assumptions of the conjecture are not satisfied. The first one happens when the number of variables is equal to the degree. The other works for any number of variables but only for composite degrees. Our innovation is to consider the problem in terms of varieties defined by forms, thereby using the tools from algebraic geometry, making their first appearance in this setting. Finally, we construct integral forms such that the ratio set of its values is dense in at least one $\mathbb{Q}_p$ but only in finitely many of them.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Daniel Perniok &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a definition of Coxeter-Dynkin algebras of canonical type generalising the definition as a path algebra of a quiver. Moreover, we construct two tilting objects over the squid algebra - one via generalised APR-tilting and one via one-point-extensions and reflection functors - and identify their endomorphism algebras with the Coxeter-Dynkin algebra. This shows that our definition gives another representative in the derived equivalence class of the squid algebra, and hence of the corresponding canonical algebra. Finally, we explain how these Coxeter-Dynkin algebras illustrate the connection to Saito's classification of marked extended affine root systems.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kun Yi Ong, Eddie Shahril Bin Ismail &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Pell equation $x^2 - Dy^2 = 1$ with non-square $D > 1$ has infinitely many integer solutions, yet most research has centered on the asymptotic behavior of fundamental units as $D$ varies. By contrast, the exact distribution of solutions for a fixed $D$ within bounded regions has received little attention. In this paper, we contribute to this direction by giving an explicit enumeration of all solutions to the Pell equation inside the square $|x| + |y| \leq \lambda$ for any $\lambda > 0$. We further extend our results to the shifted Pell equation $\left(x-a\right)^2 - D\left(y-b\right)^2 = 1$ for integers $a$ and $b$, obtaining exact counts for sufficiently large $\lambda$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** All comments are welcome. This is the first draft of the paper

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $d(n)$ be the divisor function and it is well known that $\sum_{1\leq n \leq x}d(n) = x\log x+(2\gamma-1)x +\mathcal{O}\left(x^{\theta+\epsilon}\right)$ where $\gamma$ is the Euler constant, $\epsilon>0$ and $1/4<\theta<1/3$. In this paper, we obtain an asymptotic formula for the number of irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{so}(5)$. More precisely, the irreducible representations of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}(5)$ are a family of representations of dimension $jk(j+k)(j+2k)/6$ for $j, k\in \mathbb{N}_{0}$ and suppose that $\varrho_{\mathfrak{so}(5)}(n)$ is the number of irreducible $\mathfrak{so}(5)$ representations of dimension $n$. We obtain an asymptotic formula for the summatory function $\sum_{1\leq n \leq x}\varrho_{\mathfrak{so}(5)}(n)$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ethan Ackelsberg, Vitaly Bergelson &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 42 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to undertake an in-depth study of the phenomenon behind the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem, which, in its modern form due to Kamae and Mend\`es-France, states that if $E$ is a set of integers with positive density and $P$ is an intersective polynomial, then there are distinct elements $x, y \in E$ such that $x - y = P(n)$ for some some $n$. In this paper, we identify an algebraic framework (rings of integers of global fields) for Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy-type theorems. One of our main results establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for a polynomial to satisfy the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over the ring of integers of a global field, providing an extension of the result of Kamae and Mend\`es-France. The Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy phenomenon goes beyond infinite rings and has interesting additional aspects in finite rings. As an example, classical exponential sum estimates can be used to show that large subsets of finite fields contain the asymptotically ``correct'' number of pairs $(x,y)$ whose difference is a square. In previous work, the class of polynomials satisfying this strong form of the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over finite fields was classified. In the present paper, we establish asymptotic results characterizing sequences of finite principal ideal rings that produce ``correct'' statistics in the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem and show that these families are much more general than finite fields. As an application of our enhanced forms of the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over finite rings, we produce new families of examples of quasirandom graphs of algebraic origin. The production of these new examples hinges on a two-way connection between asymptotic total ergodicity -- the phenomenon responsible for enhanced versions of the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over finite fields and rings -- and quasirandomness.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Similar to the published version. 111 pages, 26 figures, 15 tables

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We suggest a new algorithm to estimate representations of compact Lie groups from finite samples of their orbits. Different from other reported techniques, our method allows the retrieval of the precise representation type as a direct sum of irreducible representations. Moreover, the knowledge of the representation type permits the reconstruction of its orbit, which is useful for identifying the Lie group that generates the action, from a finite list of candidates. Our algorithm is general for any compact Lie group, but only instantiations for SO(2), T^d, SU(2), and SO(3) are considered. Theoretical guarantees of robustness in terms of Hausdorff and Wasserstein distances are derived. Our tools are drawn from geometric measure theory, computational geometry, and optimization on matrix manifolds. The algorithm is tested for synthetic data up to dimension 32, as well as real-life applications in image analysis, harmonic analysis, density estimation, equivariant neural networks, chemical conformational spaces, and classical mechanics systems, achieving very accurate results.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 26 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we explore how functor-induced isomorphisms are encoded by $G$-matrices. We first show that the Grothendieck group isomorphism induced by a tilting module can be realized via the $G$-matrix of this tilting module. Building on this, we compare $g$-vectors for a tilted algebra and its associated hereditary algebra, and provide $G$-matrix interpretations of the Coxeter transformation, the Nakayama functor, and the Auslander-Reiten translation for suitable algebras. Furthermore, we demonstrate that every element of any symmetric group and Weyl group can be expressed as the transpose of the $G$-matrix of some tilting module or support $\tau$-tilting module. Finally, we show that the Grothendieck group isomorphism induced by a $2$-term silting complex can also be realized via the $G$-matrix of this $2$-term silting complex.</p></details>

This requires that the term q(n-q(n-1)) be defined for all n, that is, 0 < q(n) < n+1 applies for all n in N.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** G. Kavya Keerthana, S. Ananya, Ranganatha D &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\overline{p}_{k}(n)$ denote the number of overpartition $k$-tuples of $n$. In 2023, Saikia \cite{saikia} conjectured the following congruences: \begin{align*} \overline{p}_{q}(8n+2)& \equiv 0 \pmod{4},\quad \overline{p}_{q}(8n+3)\equiv 0 \pmod{8},\quad \overline{p}_{q}(8n+4) \equiv 0 \pmod{2},\\ \overline{p}_{q}(8n+5)& \equiv 0 \pmod{8},\quad \overline{p}_{q}(8n+6) \equiv 0 \pmod{8},\quad \overline{p}_{q}(8n+7)\equiv 0 \pmod{32}, \end{align*} where $n\geq0$ and $q$ is prime. Recently, Sellers \cite{sellers2024elementary} showed that these congruences hold for all odd integers $q$ (not necessarily prime). In this paper, we show that the above congruences hold for all positive integers $q$ (not necessarily odd). We also prove the following congruences on $\overline{OPT}_k(n)$, the number of overpartition $k$-tuples with odd parts of $n$: For all $i,j\geq 1$, $n\geq 0$, $r$ not a multiple of 2, $k$ not a multiple of 2 or 3, and $\ell$ not a power of 2, nor a multiple of 2 or 3, we have \begin{align*} \overline{OPT}_{2^i\cdot r}(8n+7)& \equiv 0 \pmod{2^{i+4}}, \overline{OPT}_{3^i\cdot 2^j\cdot k}(3n+2)& \equiv 0 \pmod{3^{i+1}\cdot 2^{j+2}}, \overline{OPT}_{3^i\cdot 2^j\cdot k}(3n+1)& \equiv 0 \pmod{3^{i}\cdot 2^{j+1}},\\ \overline{OPT}_{3^i\cdot \ell}(3n+2)& \equiv 0 \pmod{3^{i+1}\cdot 2}, \overline{OPT}_{3^i\cdot \ell}(3n+1)& \equiv 0 \pmod{3^{i}\cdot 2},\end{align*} where the first congruence was posed as a conjecture by Sarma et al. \cite{saikiasarma} and the latter four were conjectured by Das et al. \cite{DSS}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Finding the largest pair of consecutive $B$-smooth integers is computationally challenging. Current algorithms to find such pairs have an exponential runtime -- which has only be provably done for $B \leq 100$ and heuristically for $100 < B \leq 113$. We improve this by detailing a new algorithm to find such large pairs. The core idea is to solve the shortest vector problem (SVP) in a well constructed lattice. With this we are able to significantly increase $B$ and notably report the heuristically largest pair with $B = 751$ which has $196$-bits. By slightly modifying the lattice, we are able to find larger pairs for which one cannot conclusively say whether it is the largest or not for a given $B$. This notably includes a $213$-bit pair with $B = 997$ which is the largest pair found in this work.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Major revision of convergence analysis (Sec 5). Main claim corrected from absolute to conditional convergence. The operator is now rigorously defined via a hyperbolic Cauchy principal value to handle singularities. The analysis is restricted to the necessary subdominant solution for convergence

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper constructs a weight-shifting integral operator, U_{k,t}, that maps the space of weight-k Maass forms to the space of weight-t functions for the full modular group SL(2,Z). The operator is defined via an integral transform whose kernel is the product of a covariant factor and a modular invariant function, F. The central hypothesis is that the kernel itself must be an eigenfunction of the weight-t hyperbolic Laplacian. We show this spectral condition reduces the determination of F to a Papperitz-Riemann equation, which is then transformed into the standard Gauss Hypergeometric Differential Equation. We provide an explicit determination of the hypergeometric parameters in terms of the initial automorphic data and rigorously establish the operator's region of conditional convergence. The automorphy of the transformed function is proven. In contrast, other key properties such as smoothness and the intertwining condition are supported by conditional arguments that rely on analytical assumptions deferred to future work. Finally, the emergence of the hypergeometric structure suggests a potential connection to the theory of hypergeometric motives, a perspective illustrated by the recovery of the periods of the Legendre family of elliptic curves in a specific case.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 41 pages, 2 figures. Many results of this paper also appear in the PhD thesis of the author. Comments are very welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study two compactifications of general hypersurfaces defined by the vanishing of linear combinations of $d+2$ monomials in $d$-dimensional algebraic tori. We prove that the number of their $\mathbb{F}_q$-points is given by finite hypergeometric sums under certain general conditions. In the process, we introduce the notion of a gamma triple, which allows us to extend the classical definition of finite hypergeometric sums to prime powers corresponding to the cyclotomic field of definition of the associated monodromy representation. As a special case of our main results, we study the Dwork family and obtain a formula for the number of its $\mathbb{F}_q$-points. Our results generalise the work of Beukers, Cohen and Mellit for finite hypergeometric sums defined over $\mathbb{Q}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be an arbitrary field of characteristic $p$ and let $G$ be a finite group. We investigate the representation type, derived representation type, and singularity category of the $k$-linear (cohomological) Mackey algebra. We classify when the cohomological Mackey algebra is wild for $G$ a cyclic $p$-group. Furthermore, we show the cohomological Mackey algebra is derived wild whenever $G$ surjects onto a $p$-group of order more than two, and the Mackey algebra is derived wild whenever $G$ is a nontrivial $p$-group. Derived wildness has some immediate consequences in equivariant homotopy theory. In particular, for the constant Mackey functor $\underline{k}$, the classification of compact modules over the $G$-equivariant Eilenberg--MacLane spectrum $H\underline{k}$ is also wild whenever $G$ surjects onto a $p$-group of order more than two. Thus, in contrast to recent work at the prime $2$ by Dugger, Hazel, and the second author, no meaningful classification of compact $C_p$-equivariant $H\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p$-modules exists at odd primes. For the Burnside Mackey functor $\underline{A}_k$, there is no classification of compact $G$-equivariant $H\underline{A}_k$-modules whenever $G$ is a nontrivial $p$-group.</p></details>

Abelian {\it UnitUC} rings are uniquely clean and {\it UnitUC} rings with nil Jacobson radical are strongly nil clean. These rings also generalize the UUC and CUC rings, defined by Calugareanu-Zhou in Mediterranean J. Math. (2023), which are rings whose clean elements are uniquely clean. These rings are also represent a natural generalization of the Boolian rings in that a ring is {\it UnitUC} if, and only if, it is exchange and Boolean modulo the Jacobson radical. The behavior of {\it UnitUC} rings under group ring and matrix ring extensions is investigated. Several examples are provided to explain and delimit the results.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A distinguished family of completely prime primitive ideals in the universal enveloping algebra of a reductive Lie algebra ${\mathfrak g}$ over ${\mathbb C}$ are those ideals constructed from one-dimensional representations of finite $W$-algebras. We refer to these ideals as Losev--Premet ideals. For ${\mathfrak g}$ simple of classical type, we prove that for a Losev-Premet ideal $I$ in $U({\mathfrak g})$, there exists a Losev-Premet ideal $I_0$ for a certain Levi subalgebra ${\mathfrak g}_0$ of ${\mathfrak g}$ such that associated variety of $I_0$ is the closure of a rigid nilpotent orbit in ${\mathfrak g}_0$ and $I$ is obtained from $I_0$ by parabolic induction; in turn, this gives a classification of rigid Losev-Premet ideals in $U({\mathfrak g})$. This is deduced from the corresponding statement about one-dimensional representations of finite $W$-algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we employ methods of contour integration and residue calculus to investigate the parity of two classes of cyclotomic Euler-type sums. One class involves products of cyclotomic harmonic numbers, while the other involves products of cyclotomic odd harmonic numbers. We derive explicit formulas for the parity of linear and quadratic cases of these cyclotomic Euler-type sums and provide several illustrative examples. The results for the linear and quadratic cases ensure that we can provide explicit formulas for the parity of cyclotomic multiple $T$-values and cyclotomic multiple $S$-values up to depth three, both of which are even-odd variants of cyclotomic multiple zeta values. Furthermore, we present declarative theorems concerning the parity of these two types of cyclotomic Euler-type sums to arbitrary orders. Additionally, using contour integration techniques, we explore explicit linear and quadratic formulas for these cyclotomic Euler-type sums under more general conditions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $Z$ be an l.c.i. scheme over $\mathbb{C}$. In this paper, we introduce a Kashiwara--Schapira-style functor of derived microlocalization, which we use to define a perverse sheaf $\mu_{Z}$ on the $-1$-shifted cotangent bundle, $T^*[-1]Z$. The sheaf $\mu_{Z}$ is designed to be a refinement of the microlocal homology of $Z$: a family of invariants introduced by Nadler that interpolates between the singular cohomology and Borel--Moore homology of $Z$. Our main result is an equivalence between $\mu_{Z}$ and the DT sheaf $\varphi_{T^*[-1]Z}$ on $T^*[-1]Z$. This provides an alternative construction for the DT sheaf in the case of a shifted cotangent bundle. The main step of our argument, which may be of independent interest, is a local computation -- closely related to one obtained recently by Kinjo using different methods -- providing a description of the classical microlocalization functor in terms of vanishing cycles.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\lfloor x\rfloor$ denote the integer part of $x$. For every sequence $(C_k)_{k\ge 1}$ of positive integers, we define $\xi(C_k)$ as the smallest real number $\xi>1$ such that $\lfloor \xi^{C_k} \rfloor$ is a prime number for every positive integer $k$. The number $\xi(3^k)$ is called Mills' constant. Recently, the author showed that $\xi(3^k)$ is irrational, but the transcendency of this number is still open. In this paper, we give sufficient conditions on $(C_k)_{k\ge 1}$ to determine the transcendency of $\xi(C_k)$. For example, we obtain the following three results: (A) $\xi(\lfloor b^k\rfloor)$ is irrational for every real number $b\geq 1+\sqrt{2}$; (B) $\xi((1+\sqrt{2})^k+(1-\sqrt{2})^k)$ is transcendental; (C) $\xi(r3^k-1)$ is transcendental for every integer $r\geq 4.003\times 10^{14}$. Furthermore, assuming the Riemann hypothesis, $\xi(3^k-1)$ is transcendental. However, we still do not know whether Mills' constant is transcendental.</p></details>

This was previously confirmed in the classical type A. In this paper we extend the result to the classical types B, C, D, with the additional inclusion of quantum Casimir elements arising from spin and half-spin representations in types B and D. We identify the Harish-Chandra images of these elements and reinterpret them uniformly in terms of irreducible characters associated with hook partitions. This yields explicit and minimal generating sets for the centres in all classical types, and provides new connections between higher-order quantum Casimir elements and hook partitions that exhibit a stability phenomenon.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We will describe solvable lattice models whose partition functions depend on two sets of variables, $x_1,\cdots,x_n$ and $y_1, y_2, \cdots $ that have different connections with the representation theory of $\text{GL}(n,F)$ where $F$ is a nonarchimedean local field. If the boundary conditions are chosen in one way, they are essentially the Motivic Chern classes that were used very effectively by Aluffi, Mihalcea, Sch\"urmann and Su (AMSS) to study such problems. In particular, using this specialization we can obtain deformations $r_{u,v}$ of the Kazhdan-Lusztig R-polynomials that were used by Bump, Nakasuji and Naruse to study matrix coefficients of intertwining operators (introduced by Casselman). Thus we are able see that the recursion formula for the $r_{u,v}$ is a reflection of the Yang-Baxter equation. On the other hand, with more general boundary conditions, specializing the parameters $y_i\to 0$ we recover colored lattice models that were previously used by Brubaker, Buciumas, Bump and Gustafsson to represent Iwahori Whittaker functions on $GL(n,F)$. Thus we term the resulting two-variable-set family of functions as ``double Whittaker polynomials.''</p></details>

As was revealed by Magee and Puder in [arXiv:1802.04862], the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices. In the first part of the current work [arXiv:2311.17733], we demonstrated how this phenomenon is much broader: we proved more instances of such results and conjectured others. These new results and conjectures involved other topological invariants (relatives of scl) and different families of groups. In the current paper we further extend and support this theory. We provide another instance of the theory and prove that the stable primitivity rank, too, can be expressed in terms of stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements of groups. We introduce concrete formulas for stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements in the symmetric group $S_N$ and its generalizations in the form of the wreath products $G\wr S_N$ where $G$ is an arbitrary compact group. We also define new stable invariants related to these groups, and prove they give bounds to many of the stable Fourier coefficients. As an aside, we generalize to tuples of words a result of Puder and Parzanchevski [arXiv:1202.3269] about the expected number of fixed points of $w$-random permutations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $w$ be a word in a free group. A few years ago, Magee and the first named author discovered that the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices [arXiv:1802.04862]. But the random-matrix side of this equality can be naturally tweaked by considering $w$-random permutations, $w$-random orthogonal matrices and so on, to produce new invariants for any given word. Are these invariants new? interesting? Do they admit an intrinsic topological description as in the case of $w$-random unitaries and scl? The current paper formalizes the definition of these invariants coming from $w$-random matrices, answers the above questions in certain cases involving generalized symmetric groups, and poses detailed conjectures in many others. In particular, we present a plethora of topological, combinatorial and algebraic invariants of words which play, or are at least conjectured to play, a similar role to the one played by scl in the above-mentioned result. Among others, these invariants include two invariants recently defined by Wilton [arXiv:2210.09853]: the stable primitivity rank and a non-oriented analog of scl.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The 2-switch-degree of $G$ is the number of distinct 2-switches acting on a graph $G$. In this work we study structural properties of the 2-switch-degree, with a focus on split graphs. Our approach is motivated by the Tyshkevich decomposition, which uniquely expresses any graph as a composition $G_r \circ \ldots \circ G_1$ of indecomposable graphs, where $G_2, \ldots, G_r$ are split. Our key tool is the factor graph $\Phi(S)$, a multigraph associated with a split graph $S$ that encodes 2-switch-degree information via edge multiplicities between independet vertices of $S$. By leveraging $\Phi(S)$, we reduce the problem of classifying indecomposable split graphs to enumerating and analyzing unlabeled connected multigraphs of fixed size. Using this method, we fully classify indecomposable split graphs of degrees 1, 2, 3, and 4. Further, we introduce and investigate the $\Delta$-property, a surprising connection between Graph Theory and Number Theory that arises from $n$-simple triangles (3-cycles with uniform edge multiplicity $n$) of the factor graph.</p></details>

We study the spectra of these operators on finite dimensional representations, and describe them in terms of rational functions with an extra symmetry. These results can be seen as the starting point of a $q$-character theory for affine Kac--Moody quantum symmetric pairs. Additionally, we prove a compatibility result linking Lusztig's and the Lu-Wang-Zhang braid group actions.</p></details>

We show that if $H\subset \ell+[\![ 0,X^{1/2+\varepsilon}]\!] $ for some $\ell\geq0$, \begin{align*} D_{a,H}(X):=\frac{1}{|H|}\sum_{h\in H}a(h)\sum_{m=1}^\infty A(1,m)\lambda(rm+h)V\left(\frac{m}{X}\right)\ll_{\pi_1,\pi_2,\varepsilon} \frac{X^{1+\varepsilon}}{|H|}\|a\|_2 \end{align*} for any $\varepsilon>0$, and a similar bound when $|H|$ is big. This improves Sun's bound and generalizes it to an average with arbitrary weights. Moreover, we demonstrate how one can recover the factorizable moduli structure given by the Jutila's circle method via studying a shifted sum with weighted average. This allows us to recover Munshi's bound on the shifted sum with a fixed shift without using the Jutila's circle method.</p></details>

However, despite extensive effort over more than six decades, no stronger general lower bound had been established. In this paper, we obtain the new bound $$ f(n) \ge 2\sqrt{n}. $$This gives the first improvement of the classical lower bound for the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres problem in the general case since 1959. In particular, our result confirms a remark of Billsborough et al., who observed that if the original Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres proof could be fixed, the O'Hara--Rodriguez bound would yield exactly this inequality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the envelopes of holomorphy of Matsuki orbits $M_{\ell,m,r}$ arising as intersections of $G_0$- and $K$-orbits in complex Grassmannians. These orbits, equipped with natural CR-structures, form a class of compact homogeneous CR-submanifolds whose analytic continuation properties are of fundamental interest. Building on Rossi's theory of holomorphic extension, we establish that the envelope of holomorphy of each Matsuki orbit coincides biholomorphically with the containing $K$-orbit $O_{\ell,m}$. Our approach provides a geometric proof based on the holomorphic fiber bundle structure $\pi : M_{\ell,m,r} \to \mathrm{Gr}_{\ell}(E_+) \times \mathrm{Gr}_{m}(E_-)$, clarifying the role of compact isotropic fibers in constraining holomorphic extension. Explicit examples, including the orbit $M_{1,1,1} \subset \mathrm{Gr}_3(\mathbb{C}^8)$, illustrate the method and highlight connections with classical constructions in complex geometry and representation theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Based on the intrinsic connection between Gaussian Free Fields and the Heisenberg vertex algebra, we study some aspects of the correspondence between probability theory and $W$-algebras. This is first achieved by providing a construction of the $W$-algebra associated to a complex simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ by means of Gaussian Free Fields. This correspondence in turn allows to translate algebraic statements into actual constraints for free-field correlation functions. This leads to new integrability results for Dotsenko-Fateev integrals associated to $\mathfrak g$, such as Ward identities and the derivation of a new Fuchsian differential equation for deformations of $B_2$-Dotsenko-Fateev integrals arising from the Mukhin-Varchenko conjecture. Along the proof of this statement we also provide new results on representation theory of $W$-algebras such as the description of some singular vectors for the $W$-algebra associated to $\mathfrak g=B_2$.</p></details>

In this paper we present a new proof of this result, which also gives an improved error term as $X\rightarrow\infty$. Similar to Afifurrahman's result, our error term is uniform in both $n$ and $X$, and our estimates are significant for $X$ as small as $n^{1/2+\delta}$. To complement this, we also demonstrate that the exponent $1/2+\delta$ in this statement cannot be reduced, by establishing a result which gives a different asymptotic main term when $n$ is either a prime or the square of a prime, and when $X=n^{1/2}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a generalized Floquet-Bloch theory for discrete torsion-free nilpotent groups by exploiting their Malcev completions. Our main result is a branching formula that relates finite-dimensional representations of a discrete nilpotent lattice to infinite-dimensional unitary representations of its simply connected nilpotent Lie group. This generalization enables to extend the following two classical asymptotic problems (i) a Chebotarev density analogue for prime closed geodesics on compact negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent covers, and (ii) long time asymptotic expansions of heat kernels on such coverings to the nilpotent setting. As a by-product, we derive a semi-classical expansion for the Harper operator, presenting an alternative to mathematical justification of Wilkinson's formula by Helffer-Sj\"ostrand. We conclude by proposing several avenues for future work: extensions to general hyperbolic flows and noncompact manifolds (in particular knot complements and related quasi-morphisms), connections to modified Riemann-Hilbert problems and opers. Furthermore, we give a brief comment on asymptotic behavior of knot invariants and infinite extensions in number theory.</p></details>

But since the discovery of connections to cluster algebras and categories of type $A$, interest in friezes has exploded, several generalizations have been studied, and links to geometry and combinatorics have been explored. In this article we will review some of the most striking results connecting the purely combinatorially defined friezes with triangulations of polygons, Grassmannian cluster algebras and (Grassmannian) cluster categories. Then we will focus on Grassmannian cluster categories and some recent results linking them to friezes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that, for adic \'{e}tale motives over $\mathbb{C}_p$, the vector bundles on the Fargues-Fontaine curve arising from their Hyodo-Kato cohomology coincide with their de Rham-Fargues-Fontaine cohomologies, where the latter provides an overconvergent refinement of crystalline vector bundles, albeit constructed on the generic fiber. This equivalence is established in the setting of symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories and respects the full motivic structure. Furthermore, we enrich both realizations with Galois actions, yielding $G_{\breve{\mathbb{Q}}_{p}}$-equivariant solid quasi-coherent sheaves on the Fargues-Fontaine curve; in this equivariant context, the comparison isomorphism becomes canonical. As an application, we show that the de Rham-Fargues-Fontaine cohomology of any smooth quasi-compact rigid analytic variety over $\mathbb{C}_p$ admits a finite slope-increasing filtration.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 41 pages. This revised version contains various minor changes, corrections and additions

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We lay the foundations for a broad algebraic theory encompassing SICs in the hope of elucidating their heuristic connections with Stark units. What emerges is a greatly generalised set-up with added structure and potential for applications in other areas. Let $A$ and $B$ be finite modules for a commutative ring $R$, $C$ a finite abelian group and $\lambda: A\times B\rightarrow C$ an $R$-balanced bilinear pairing. The main constructs are the generalised Heisenberg group ${\cal H}={\cal H}(A,B,C,\lambda)$ attached to these data (an abstract central extension of $A\oplus B$ by $C$) which plays the role of the Weyl-Heisenberg group in SIC theory, together with its canonical, unitary Schr\"odinger representations. The SIC itself is replaced by an ${\cal H}$-orbit of complex lines in the representation space, termed a `bouquet'. The overlaps of the SIC are interpreted as a map from ${\cal H}/Z({\cal H})$ into $\mathbb C$ whose absolute values are the Hermitian `angles' between the lines in the bouquet. We also introduce a regularity condition on bouquets in terms of the angle-map, intended to weaken the equiangularity condition of SICs. At the same time, it allows the incorporation of the $R$-structure via the abstract automorphism group of ${\cal H}$ which in turn generalises the Clifford group of SIC theory via its associated Weil representation. As well as several subsidiary definitions and `structural' results, we prove a new `clinometric relation' for the angle-map, determine the structure of the automorphism group and introduce a large class of examples of arithmetic origin, derived from the trace-pairing on quotients of fractional ideals in an arbitrary number field, which we investigate in greater detail.</p></details>

As an application, we show that the Hyodo-Kato realization factors through the weight complex functor studied by Bondarko and Sosnilo. In particular, the weight complex yields a spectral sequence converging to the Hyodo-Kato cohomology of smooth quasi-compact $K$-rigid analytic spaces, thereby inducing a weight filtration on it.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study linear versions of Reedy categories in relation with finite dimensional algebras and abelian model structures. We prove that, for a linear Reedy category $\mathcal{C}$ over a field, the category of left $\mathcal{C}$--modules admits a highest weight structure, which in case $\mathcal{C}$ is finite corresponds to a quasi-hereditary algebra with an exact Borel subalgebra. We also lift complete cotorsion pairs and abelian model structures to certain categories of additive functors indexed by linear Reedy categories, generalizing analogous results from the hereditary case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2001, Bombieri and Zannier studied the Northcott property (N) for infinite Galois extensions of the rationals. In particular they provided a local property of the extensions that imply property (N). Later, Checcoli and Fehm demonstrated the existence of infinite extensions satisfying this local property. In this article, we establish two main results. First, we show that this local property, unlike property (N), is not preserved under finite extensions. Second, we show that, for an infinite Galois extension of Q, such local property cannot be read on the Galois group. More precisely, we exhibit several profinite groups that are realizable over Q by fields that do not satisfy the local property.</p></details>

Our bounds are sharp for all fields of size greater than the degree. Moreover, we provide explicit constructions reaching the tightness constraints for all fields of characteristic 0, and for all sufficiently large fields in the one- and two-variable case. Additionally, we fully solve the one-variable case, and conjecture the asymptotics in the multivariate case, for all finite fields.</p></details>

When the quiver varieties have isolated torus fixed points, we compute the coefficients of the vertex functions in the $K$-theoretic fixed point basis. We also give an explicit combinatorial description of zero-dimensional type $D$ quiver varieties and their vertex functions using the combinatorics of minuscule posets. Using Macdonald polynomials, we prove that these vertex functions can be expressed as products of $q$-binomial functions, which proves a degeneration of the conjectured 3d mirror symmetry of vertex functions. We provide an interpretation of type $D$ spin vertex functions as the partition functions of the half-space Macdonald processes of Barraquand, Borodin, and Corwin. This hints that the geometry of quiver varieties may provide new examples of integrable probabilistic models.</p></details>

In type $\widetilde{\mathbb{A}}$, the Hom-Ext quiver of an exceptional set is the tiling algebra of the corresponding geometric model. And, in that case, Hom-Ext quivers classify exceptional sets up to Dehn twist of the corresponding geometric model. We show that these Dehn twists are realized by twist functors and give autoequivalences of the derived category. We provide a generating set for the group of autoequivalences of the derived category in type $\widetilde{\mathbb{A}}$, and show that the Hom-Ext quiver classifies exceptional sets up to derived autoequivalence. We introduce superquivers, which are a generalization of Hom-Ext quivers. Exceptional sets over finite acyclic quivers are realized as representations of superquivers. Throughout, we list several questions and conjectures that make for, what we believe, exciting new research.</p></details>

For $\ell = 2$, this was proved by Kable and Wright using the deep theory of prehomogeneous vector spaces. Foster proved that Steinitz classes are uniformly distributed between realizable classes for tamely ramified elementary-$m$ extensions using the theory of Galois modules; our approach eliminates this tameness hypothesis.</p></details>

The conjecture predicts the supersingular order of the weight $12t$ form $L_2(\Delta^t)$, when $(p-1)\mid 12t,$ attached to the $\Gamma_0(2)$ Hecke correspondence. We prove the prediction for all primes $p\ge5$, thereby providing the precise modular input that calibrates the relevant ANSS differentials in the Behrens program and removes the last obstruction to using pure $\Delta$-power across the range of indices where Hodge-scaling cancels.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give in this paper a survey of results obtained in our earlier papers, and state explicitly some problems of further research, for example: are the analytic ranks bounded, or not? Twists of Carlitz modules are parametrized by polynomials over finite fields $\Bbb F_q$. The analytic rank of a twist is the order of zero of its L-function at a point. The set of polynomials of degree $\le m$ such that the analytic ranks of the corresponding twists are $\ge i$ is $X(m,i)(\Bbb F_q)$ where $X(m,i)$ is an affine variety defined over $\Bbb F_p$ (we do not know what is its dimension). We consider also a related invariant of a twist, namely, the behaviour of its L-function at infinity (the rank at infinity). We know much more on varieties corresponding to twists of a fixed rank at infinity and on their lifts from $\Bbb F_p$ to $\Bbb Z$ . For example, for $q=2$ the irreducible components of these varieties are described in terms of finite rooted weighted binary trees. A similar description for $q>2$ is not found yet.</p></details>

The quiver variety associated with the Jordan quiver is either isomorphic to the punctual Hilbert scheme in $\mathbb{C}^2$ or to the Calogero-Moser space. We describe the irreducible components using quiver varieties of McKay's quiver associated with the finite subgroup $\Gamma$ and we have given a general combinatorial model of the indexing set of these irreducible components in terms of certain elements of the root lattice of the affine Lie algebra associated with $\Gamma$. Finally, we prove that for every projective, symplectic resolution of a wreath product singularity, there exists an irreducible component of the fixed point locus of the punctual Hilbert scheme in the plane that is isomorphic to the resolution.</p></details>

We then provide a classification of which finite groups result in an almost commutative Terwilliger algebra when looking at the group association scheme determined by the conjugacy classes. In particular, we show that all such groups are either abelian, or Camina groups. We then compute the dimension of each Terwilliger algebra, and we also express each of the group association schemes with an almost commutative Terwilliger algebra as a wreath product of the group schemes of finite abelian groups and $1-$class association schemes.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a complex algebraic group $G$ and complex $G$-variety $X$, one can study the affine Hamiltonian Lagrangian (AHL) $G$-bundles over $X$. Lisiecki indexes the isomorphism classes of such bundles in the case of a homogeneous $G$-variety $X=G/H$; the indexing set is the set of $H$-fixed points $(\mathfrak{h}^*)^H\subset\mathfrak{h}^*$, where $\mathfrak{h}$ is the Lie algebra of $H$. In very rough terms, one may regard $\psi\in(\mathfrak{h}^*)^H$ as labeling the isomorphism class of a $\psi$-twisted cotangent bundle of $G/H$. These twisted cotangent bundles feature prominently in geometric representation theory and symplectic geometry. We introduce and examine the notion of a universal family of AHL $G$-bundles over a $G$-variety $X$, as part of a broader program on Lie-theoretic and incidence-theoretic constructions of regular Poisson varieties. This family is defined to be a flat family $\pi:\mathcal{U}\longrightarrow Y$, in which $\mathcal{U}$ is a Poisson variety, the fibers of $\pi$ form a complete list of representatives of the isomorphism classes of AHL $G$-bundles over $X$, and other pertinent properties are satisfied. Our first main result is the construction of a universal family of AHL $G$-bundles over a homogeneous base $X=G/H$, for connected $H$. In our second main result, we take $X$ to be a conjugacy class $\mathcal{C}$ of self-normalizing closed subgroups of $G$. We associate to $\mathcal{C}$ a regular Poisson variety $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{C}}$, defined in incidence-theoretic terms. Attention is paid to the case of conjugacy classes of normalizers of symmetric subgroups. In the case of a connected semisimple group $G$ and conjugacy class $\mathcal{C}$ of parabolic subgroups, our third main result relates $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{C}}$ to the partial Grothendieck-Springer resolution for $\mathcal{C}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a set of generators for the space of Eisenstein series of even weight $k$ for any congruence group $\Gamma$ and study the set of all of their zeros taken for $\Gamma(1)$-conjugates of $\Gamma$ in the standard fundamental domain for $\Gamma(1)$. We describe (a) an upper bound $\kappa_\Gamma + O(1/k)$ for their imaginary part; (b) a finite configuration of geodesics segments to which all zeros converge in Hausdorff distance as $k \rightarrow \infty$; (c) a finite set containing all algebraic zeros for all weights. The bound in (a) depends on the (non-)vanishing of a new generalization of Ramanujan sums. The proof of (b) originates in a method used to study phase transitions in statistical physics. The proof of (c) relies on the theory of complex multiplication. The results can be made quantitative for specific groups. For $\Gamma=\Gamma(N)$ with $4 \nmid N$, $\kappa_\Gamma=1$ and the zeros tend to the unit circle, whereas if $4 \mid N$, $\kappa_\Gamma=2$ and the limit configuration includes parts of vertical geodesics and circles of radius $2$. In both cases, the only algebraic zeros are at $\mathrm{i}$ and $\exp(2\pi \mathrm{i}/3)$ for sufficiently large $k$. For $\Gamma(N)$ with $N$ odd, we use finer estimates to prove a trichotomy for the exact `convergence speed' of the zeros to the unit circle, as well as angular equidistribution of the zeros as $k \rightarrow \infty$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the patching setting, given a factorization inverse system of fields over which patching for finite-dimensional vector spaces holds, together with a crossed module over the inverse limit field, the corresponding six-term Mayer--Vietoris sequence is constructed, generalizing the classical result of Harbater--Hartmann--Krashen for linear algebraic groups. When the crossed module is a two-term complex of tori, the above sequence is extended into a nine-term exact sequence, notably without any assumption on global domination of Galois cohomology of the inverse system. To this end, we develop a theory of (co-)flasque resolutions for short complexes of tori which is built on the work of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Sansuc. As an application, we show that patching holds for nonabelian second Galois cohomology of reductive groups with smooth centers. We also obtain a weak local--global principle for this cohomology set in the simply connected semisimple case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Brauer groups of regular conic bundles over elliptic curves defined over a number field $k$. We explicitly compute the Brauer group of the conic bundle when the singular fibres lie above $k$-points that are divisible by $2$ in $E(k)$, and the corresponding ramification fields are isomorphic. We apply the result to compute the Brauer group of a class of surfaces analogous to that of Ch\^{a}telet surfaces. We investigate Brauer-Manin obstructions to weak approximation coming from the real places on such surfaces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The star discrepancy is a quantitative measure of the uniformity of a point set in the unit cube. A central quantity of interest is the inverse of the star discrepancy, $N(\varepsilon, s)$, defined as the minimum number of points required to achieve a star discrepancy of at most~$\varepsilon$ in dimension~$s$. It is known that $N(\varepsilon, s)$ depends only linearly on the dimension~$s$. All known proofs of this result are non-constructive. Finding explicit point set constructions that achieve this optimal linear dependence on the dimension remains a major open problem. In this paper, we make progress on this question by analyzing point sets constructed from a multiset union of digitally shifted Korobov polynomial lattice point sets. Specifically, we show the following two results. A union of randomly generated Korobov polynomial lattice point sets shifted by a random digital shift of depth $m$ can achieve a star discrepancy whose inverse depends only linearly on $s$. The second result shows that a union of all Korobov polynomial lattice point sets, each shifted by a different random digital shift, achieves the same star discrepancy bound. While our proof relies on a concentration result (Bennett's inequality) and is therefore non-constructive, it significantly reduces the search space for such point sets from a continuum of possibilities to a finite set of candidates, marking a step towards a fully explicit construction.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G \subset SL_3(\mathbb{C})$ be a finite abelian subgroup, and let $Y = G\mathrm{-}\mathrm{Hilb}(\mathbb{C}^3)$ be the corresponding $G$-Hilbert scheme. Denote by $\Psi: D^b_G(\mathrm{Coh}(\mathbb{C}^3)) \to D^b(\mathrm{Coh}(Y))$ the Bridgeland--King--Reid derived equivalence. For a nontrivial character $\chi$ of $G$, let $\chi^!$ be the corresponding skyscraper sheaf supported at the origin. It is known that $\Psi(\chi^!)$ is always a pure sheaf supported either in degree $0$ or in degree $-1$. We prove that the proportion of characters $\chi$ for which $\Psi(\chi^!)$ is supported in degree $0$ is a rational number lying between $0.25$ and $1$, with both bounds being sharp. Moreover, we exhibit families of resolutions for which these proportions attain certain explicit values within this range.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Starting from its original definition in module categories with respect to projective modules, the index has played an important role in various aspects of homological algebra, categorification of cluster algebras and $K$-theory. In the last few years, the notion of index has been generalised to several different contexts in (higher) homological algebra, typically with respect to a (higher) cluster-tilting subcategory $\mathcal{X}$ of the relevant ambient category $\mathcal{C}$. The recent tools of extriangulated and higher-exangulated categories have permitted some conditions on the subcategory $\mathcal{X}$ to be relaxed. In this paper, we introduce the index with respect to a generating, contravariantly finite subcategory of a $d$-exact category that has $d$-kernels. We show that our index has the important property of being additive on $d$-exact sequences up to an error term.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A field $F$ is a $\mathfrak{B}_s$-field if, for every finite extension $E'/E$ of $F$, the norm map $K_s^M(E')\to K_s^M(E)$ of the Milnor $K$-groups is surjective. In particular, finite fields ($s=1$), local fields, and certain global fields (with $s=2$) satisfy this condition. For such a field $F$ and a $d$-dimensional variety $X$ over $F$, we prove that $CH^{d+n}(X,n)$ is divisible for $n \geq s+1$, and $CH^{d+s}(X,s)$ is isomorphic to the direct sum of the Milnor $K$-group $K_{s}^M(F)$ and a divisible group. As an application, we study the Kato homology groups $KH_0^{(n)}(X,\mathbb{Z}/l^r\mathbb{Z})$ for any prime $l$ different from the characteristic of $F$.</p></details>
