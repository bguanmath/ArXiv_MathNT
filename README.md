 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Steven Charlton &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 4 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give an explicit formula proving Xu's Conjecture on alternating double zeta values. We also discuss the limitations of Glanois' motivic Galois descent criterion in this case, as it cannot specify the depth of the descent.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Francesco Genovese, Chiara Sava, Jan Šťovíček &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 64 pages, comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we construct the stable derivator associated to a homotopically complete and cocomplete dg-category by explicitly defining homotopy Kan extensions via suitable weighted homotopy limits and colimits in dg-categories. By restricting the domain of the derivator to finite direct categories, we obtain a well-defined derivator even for pretriangulated dg-categories. This definition enables an explicit description of the derivator associated to a weakly idempotent complete Frobenius exact category, leading to a more direct characterization in terms of Gorenstein projective (equivalently, Gorenstein injective) diagrams.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Heiko Knospe, Andrzej Dąbrowski &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages, 3 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the twisting of motivic $L$-functions by a family of multiplicative characters $\psi$, defined on prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}$ via $\psi(p)=\alpha^{N(\mathfrak{p})}$ for a fixed $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$. One can extend $\psi$ to a continuous non-Hecke character on the idele group of a number field. For $|\alpha|<1$, the resulting $\psi$-twisted $L$-function has interesting analytic properties: an enhanced half-plane of absolute convergence, preservation of the Euler product structure, and meromorphic continuation to the complex plane. We give applications to Dirichlet $L$-functions and $L$-functions associated to modular forms. Furthermore, we show that $\psi$-twisting allows the construction of convergent $p$-adic Dirichlet series and $p$-adic Euler products.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article we explain the Buium--Coleman approach to the Manin--Mumford conjecture, and outline its generalisations. As an illustration, we give a $p$-adic proof of a theorem of Bombieri, Masser and Zannier on curves in tori.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide new upper bounds for sums of certain arithmetic functions in many variables at polynomial arguments and, exploiting recent progress on the mean-value of the Erd\H os-Hooley $\Delta$-function, we derive lower bounds for the cardinality of those integers not exceeding a given limit that are expressible as some sums of powers.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sachi Hashimoto, Timo Keller, Samuel Le Fourn &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 61 pages, comments welcome! Revised section 8.1 and corrected Atkin-Lehner signs in Proposition 5.13

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $N$ be a non-squarefree integer such that the quotient $X_0(N)^*$ of the modular curve $X_0(N)$ by the full group of Atkin-Lehner involutions has positive genus. Elkies conjectures that the rational points on $X_0(N)^*$ are only cusps or CM points when $N$ is large enough. We establish an integrality result for the $j$-invariants of non-cuspidal rational points on $X_0(N)^*$, representing a significant step toward resolving a key subcase of Elkies' conjecture. To this end, we prove the existence of rank-zero quotients of certain modular Jacobians $J_0(pq)$. Furthermore, we provide a complete classification of the rational points on $X_0(N)^*$ of genus $1 \leq g \leq 5$, when they are finite. In the process we identify exceptional rational points on $X_0(147)^*$ and $X_0(75)^*$ which were not known before.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hiroki Aoki, Riku Higa, Ryosei Sugawara &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 15 pages. This manuscript is a more recent version, correcting some minor errors from the published version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we give a short and entirely elementary proof of the proposition ``For any positive integer $ N $, there exists a real number $ L $ such that for any real number $ x \geqq L $, there are at least $ N $ primes in the interval $ [kx, (k+1)x] $'' for $ k \leqq 15 $. Our proof is based on the idea of the proof by Erd\"{o}s for $ k=1 $ and its improvement by Hitotsumatsu and by Sainose for $ k=2 $. In the case of $ k=3 $ and $ k=4 $, the method is very similar to the case of $ k=2 $, however, in the case of $ k \geqq 5 $, we need new idea to complete the proof.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Mihai Prunescu, Joseph M. Shunia &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Four appendixes with codes and formulas; Revision includes corrections of several typos, including a typo which impacted the monomial expansion for the final p(n) term

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present the first fixed-length elementary closed-form expressions for the prime-counting function, $\pi(n)$, and the $n$-th prime number, $p(n)$. These expressions are arithmetic terms, requiring only a finite and fixed number of elementary arithmetic operations from the set: addition, subtraction, multiplication, integer division, and exponentiation. Mazzanti proved that every Kalmar function can be represented as an arithmetic term. We develop an arithmetic term representing the prime omega function, $\omega(n)$, which counts the number of distinct prime divisors of a positive integer $n$. From this term, we find immediately an arithmetic term for the prime-counting function, $\pi(n)$. Combining these results with a new arithmetic term for binomial coefficients and novel prime-related exponential Diophantine equations, we manage to develop an arithmetic term for the $n$-th prime number, $p(n)$, thereby providing a constructive solution to the fundamental question: Is there an order to the primes?</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02504v1'>2508.02504</a>\]&nbsp; **A Mackey embedding for reduced C*-algebras of real reductive groups**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Pierre Clare, Nigel Higson, Angel Román &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The purpose of this paper is construct an embedding of the C*-algebra of the Cartan motion group of a real reductive group G into the reduced C*-algebra of G itself. The embedding has a number of applications: we shall use it to characterize the Mackey bijection from the tempered dual of G into the unitary dual of the motion group; to characterize the continuous field of reduced group C*-algebras arising from the contraction of G to its Cartan motion group; and to characterize the Connes-Kasparov assembly map in operator K-theory. Our results continue and complete a project that was begun several years ago by the last two authors, who considered the case of complex groups. In the real case, detailed information from the theory of R-groups is used in the construction.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02457v1'>2508.02457</a>\]&nbsp; **Summing over homology groups of 3-manifolds**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Thomas Nicosanti, Pavel Putrov &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** hep-th &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 55 pages, 3 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a toy model of a 3-dimensional topological quantum gravity. In this model, a contribution of a given 3-manifold is given by the partition function of an abelian Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT), with a topological boundary condition at the boundary. Using the fact that the TQFT partition function depends only on the first homology group of the 3-manifold with some additional structure, the sum over all 3-manifolds with fixed boundary can be rewritten as a sum over finitely generated abelian groups (and the extra structure). We present bounds on the universal weights in the sum, that is, the measure on the set of isomorphism classes of finitely generated abelian groups (with the extra structure) sufficient for the sum to be convergent. Moreover, with further assumptions on the measure, we argue the existence of a distribution of 2d TQFTs, such that the sum is equal to the ensemble average of their partition functions evaluated on the boundary. For a certain kind of measure, the sum over the abelian groups can be factorized into sums over abelian $p$-groups, and the analysis can be performed independently for each prime $p$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19008v2'>2504.19008</a>\]&nbsp; **Color rules for cyclic wreath products and semigroup algebras from projective toric varieties**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Fabián Levicán, Marino Romero &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 38 pages; updated formatting, corrected typos, fixed minor mistake in Example 5.9, added Figure 7 illustrating wreath statistics for tableau

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of "color rules" for computing class functions of $Z_k \wr S_n$, where $Z_k$ is the cyclic group of order $k$ and $S_n$ is the symmetric group on $n$ letters. Using a general sign-reversing involution and a map of order $k$, we give a combinatorial proof that the irreducible decomposition of these class functions is given by a weighted sum over semistandard tableaux in the colors. Since using two colors at once is also a color rule, we are consequently able to decompose arbitrary tensor products of representations whose characters can be computed via color rules. This method extends to class functions of $G \wr S_n$ where $G$ is a finite abelian group. We give a number of applications, including decomposing tensor powers of the defining representation, along with a combinatorial proof of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for $Z_k \wr S_n$. Our main application is to the study of the linear action of $Z_k \wr S_n$ on bigraded affine semigroup algebras arising from the product of projective toric varieties. In the case of the product of projective spaces, our methods give the decomposition of these bigraded characters into irreducible characters, thus deriving equivariant generalizations of Euler-Mahonian identities.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Federico Viola &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 28 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a locally finite tree T where every vertex has degree >= 3, and a closed noncompact subgroup G of the automorphism group Aut(T), with Tits' independence property (P) and with transitive action on the boundary of the tree. We show that G does not have continuous irreducible representations to a locally convex topological vector space over R, C or H that preserve a continuous nondegenerate sesquilinear form of index p > 1. As the representations of index 1 are already classified, this gives a complete classification of continuous irreducible representations of G that preserve a continuous nondegenerate sesquilinear form of finite index.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 35 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a certain random variable closely related to the value-distribution of the Hurwitz zeta-function with algebraic parameter. We prove a version of the limit theorem, where the limit measure is presented by the law of this random variable. Then we apply it to show that any complex number can be approximated by values of the Hurwitz zeta-function for algebraic irrational parameters but with finite exceptions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Exposition improved, expanded

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a purely derivator-theoretical reformulation and proof of a classic result of Happel and Ladkani, showing that it occurs uniformly across stable derivators and it is then independent of coefficients. The resulting equivalence provides a bridge between homotopy theory and representation theory: indeed, our result is a derivator-theoretic version of the $\infty$-Dold-Kan correspondence for bounded chain complexes. Moreover, our equivalence can also be realized as an action of a spectral bimodule in the setting of universal tilting theory developed by Groth and \v{S}\v{t}ov\'i\v{c}ek.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Richard Lyons, J. Miquel Martínez, Gabriel Navarro, Pham Huu Tiep &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Several recent problems in the representation theory of finite groups require determining whether certain characters of almost simple groups belong to the principal block. Since the values of these characters are not yet known, we employ alternative group-theoretical techniques to address the "going down" case. This approach enables us to reduce the block version of well-known results by the third and fourth authors to a question about almost simple groups. Moreover, this suggests a Galois analogue of the height-zero-equal-degree conjecture of Malle and Navarro, which we formulate. However, the "going up" case of irreducible extensions of principal block characters remains unresolved.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Propositions 5.8 and 5.9 have been added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a geometric construction of Kashiwara crystals on the irreducible components of the varieties of multiparameter persistence modules. Our approach differs from the seminal work of Kashiwara and Saito, as well as subsequent related works, by emphasizing commutative relations rather than preprojective relations for a given quiver. Furthermore, we provide explicit descriptions of the Kashiwara operators in the fundamental cases of 1- and 2-parameter persistence modules, offering concrete insights into the crystal structure in these settings.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Some material moved to an appendix on github, improved exposition, 36 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a categorical description of all abelian varieties with commutative endomorphism ring over a finite field with $q=p^a$ elements in a fixed isogeny class in terms of pairs consisting of a fractional $\mathbb Z[\pi,q/\pi]$-ideal and a fractional $W\otimes_{\mathbb Z_p} \mathbb Z_p[\pi,q/\pi]$-ideal, with $\pi$ the Frobenius endomorphism and $W$ the ring of integers in an unramified extension of $\mathbb Q_p$ of degree $a$. The latter ideal should be compatible at $p$ with the former and stable under the action of a semilinear Frobenius (and Verschiebung) operator; it will be the Dieudonn\'e module of the corresponding abelian variety. Using this categorical description we create effective algorithms to compute isomorphism classes of these objects and we produce many new examples exhibiting exotic patterns.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages, to appear in "Transformation Groups"

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group with simply connected derived subgroup. Over the complex numbers there exists a local method to study the geometric properties of a point $g$ in the closure of a Jordan class of $G$ in terms of Jordan classes of a maximal rank reductive subgroup $M \leq G$ depending on the point $g$, and further to the closures of certain decomposition classes in Lie($M$). We adapt this method to the case of an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p$, and we give sufficient restrictions on $p$ for it to hold.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 62 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the map on Balmer spectra induced by a fully faithful geometric functor is a quotient map whose fibers are connected. This is an analogue of the Zariski Connectedness Theorem in algebraic geometry and it can be applied to a plethora of examples in equivariant and motivic mathematics. We isolate a significant source of examples by introducing the "concentration" of a tt-category at a well-behaved chosen set of compact generators. Various categories of cellular objects arise in this way. In particular, the "unitation" of a tt-category is the concentration at the unit object. We compute the Balmer spectrum of the unitation of the equivariant stable homotopy category as well as related categories arising in equivariant higher algebra. We also apply our results to the study of the comparison map of a tt-category. Among other results, we prove that the comparison map of a connective category is a quotient map with connected fibers. This involves studying the tt-geometry of weight complex functors, which may be of independent interest. We also study the relationship between the comparison map and the affinization of the Balmer spectrum viewed as a locally ringed space. These results provide a layered approach to understanding the spectrum of a given tt-category, by starting with the Zariski spectrum of the endomorphism ring of the unit, and then passing backwards to larger and larger concentrations (through quotient maps with connected fibers). Significant stages along the way include the passage to the unitation and the passage to the concentration at the Picard group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We will provide a new type of zero-density estimate for $\zeta(s)$ when $\sigma$ is sufficiently close to $1$. In particular, we will show that $N(\sigma,T)$ can be bounded by an absolute constant when $\sigma$ is sufficiently close to the left edge of the Korobov-Vinogradov zero-free region. As a consequence, we provide the optimal error term in the prime number theorem of the form $$ \psi(x)-x \ll x\exp \left\{-(1-\varepsilon) \omega(x)\right\},\qquad \omega(x):=\min _{t \geq 1}\{\nu(t) \log x+\log t\}, $$ where $\nu(t)=A_0(\log t)^{-2/3}(\log\log t)^{-1/3}$ is a decreasing function such that $\zeta(\sigma+it)\neq 0$ for $\sigma\ge 1-\nu(t)$. Precisely, we will show that we can take $\varepsilon=0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We apply the operadic modeling of brace $B_{\infty}$ algebras, as developed by Gerstenhaber and Voronov, to the context of Hopf algebroids in the sense of Xu. Specifically, we construct a strict $B_{\infty}$ isomorphism between the type I and type II twisted brace $B_{\infty}$ algebras arising from any twistor of a Hopf algebroid. As an application of this framework, we examine two specific brace $B_{\infty}$ algebras derived from Lie algebra pairs, and reveal previously obscured relationships between them. One of these is the dg Lie algebra governing deformations of algebraic dynamical twists, while the other arises from the quantum groupoid comprised of particular invariant differential operators.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Leizhen Bao, Fang Li &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper aims to use a cluster-theoretic approach to give a kind of Diophantine equation whose solutions can be obtained by starting from initial solutions through mutations. We establish a novel framework bridging cluster theory and Diophantine equations through the lens of cluster symmetry. On the one hand, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for Laurent polynomials to remain invariant under a given cluster symmetric map. On the other hand, we construct a discriminant algorithm to determine whether the corresponding Laurent polynomial admits a cluster symmetric pair and whether it can be realized in a generalized cluster algebra. As applications of this framework, we solve two Diophantine equations, describe three classes of invariant Laurent polynomial rings, resolve two questions posed by Gyoda and Matsushita in \cite{Gyoda}, and lastly give two Matlab programs, respectively, for constructing invariant Laurent polynomials and finding cluster symmetric pairs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We deform the heat kernel and the Brownian motion on $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ from the perspective of "$(k,a)$-generalized Fourier analysis" with $k=0$. This is a new type of harmonic analysis proposed by S.Ben Sa\"id--T.Kobayashi--B.{\O}rsted from the representation theoretic viewpoint. In this paper, we construct the $a$-deformed heat kernel and $a$-deformed Brownian motion, and explore their some basic properties.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In two papers entitled ``Two generalizations of almost perfect nonlinearity" and ``On the vector subspaces of $\mathbb F_{2^n}$ over which the multiplicative inverse function sums to zero", the first author has introduced and studied the notion of sum-freedom of vectorial functions, which expresses that a function sums to nonzero values over all affine subspaces of $\Bbb F_{2^n}$ of a given dimension $k\geq 2$, and he then focused on the $k$th order sum-freedom of the multiplicative inverse function $x\in \Bbb F_{2^n}\mapsto x^{2^n-2}$. Some general results were given for this function (in particular, the case of affine spaces that do not contain 0 was solved positively), and the cases of $k\in \{3,n-3\}$ and of $k$ not co-prime with $n$ were solved as well (negatively); but the cases of those linear subspaces of dimension $k\in [\![ 4;n-4]\!]$, co-prime with $n$, were left open. The present paper is a continuation of the previous work. After studying, from two different angles, the particular case of those linear subspaces that are stable under the Frobenius automorphism, we deduce from the second approach that, for $k$ small enough (approximately, $3\le k\leq n/10$), the multiplicative inverse function is not $k$th order sum-free. Finally, we extend a result previously obtained in the second paper mentioned above, and we deduce in particular that, for any even $n$ and every $2\leq k\leq n-2$, the multiplicative inverse function is not $k$th order sum-free.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is the second in a series devoted to describing the integral Chow ring of the moduli stacks $\mathcal{RH}_g$ of hyperelliptic Prym pairs. For fixed genus $g$, the stack $\mathcal{RH}_g$ is the disjoint union of $\lfloor (g+1)/2 \rfloor$ components $\mathcal{RH}_g^n$ for $n = 1, \ldots, \lfloor (g+1)/2 \rfloor$. In this paper, we give presentations and compute the integral Chow rings of the components $\mathcal{RH}_g^{(g+1)/2}$ for odd $g$. As an application, we also obtain presentations and Chow rings for all irreducible components of the moduli stack of hyperelliptic Spin curves of odd genus. An intermediate result of independent interest is the computation of the integral Chow ring of the moduli stack of unordered pairs of divisors of the same even degree in $\mathbb{P}^1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite VOA, not necessarily rational or self-dual. In this paper, we establish various versions of the sewing-factorization (SF) theorems for conformal blocks associated to grading-restricted generalized modules of $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$ (where $N\in\mathbb N$). In addition to the versions announced in the Introduction of [GZ23], we prove the following coend version of the SF theorem: Let $\mathfrak F$ be a compact Riemann surface with $N$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points, and let $\mathfrak G$ be another compact Riemann surface with $K$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points. Assign $\mathbb W\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes N})$ and $\mathbb X\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes K})$ to the incoming marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. For each $\mathbb{M} \in \mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes R})$, assign $\mathbb{M}$ and its contragredient $\mathbb M'$ to the outgoing marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. Denote the corresponding spaces of conformal blocks by $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb W)$ and $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak{G}}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes\mathbb X)$. Let the $\mathfrak X$ be the $(N+K)$-pointed surface obtained by sewing $\mathfrak F$, $\mathfrak G$ along their outgoing marked points. Then the sewing of conformal blocks-proved to be convergent in [GZ24]-yields an isomorphism of vector spaces $$\int^{\mathbb{M}\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes R})}\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb{W})\otimes_{\mathbb C} \mathscr T_{\mathfrak G}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes \mathbb X)\simeq\mathscr T_{\mathfrak X}^*(\mathbb W\otimes \mathbb X)$$ We also discuss the relation between conformal blocks and the modular functors defined using Lyubashenko's coend in the case where $\mathbb V$ is strongly finite and rigid.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article develops a practical technique for studying representations of $\Bbbk$-linear categories arising in the categorification of quantum groups. We work in terms of locally unital algebras which are $\mathbb{Z}$-graded with graded pieces that are finite-dimensional and bounded below, developing a theory of graded triangular bases for such algebras. The definition is a graded extension of the notion of triangular basis introduced in previous joint work with Stroppel. However, in the general graded setting, finitely generated projective modules often fail to be Noetherian, so that existing results from the study of highest weight categories are not directly applicable. Nevertheless, we show that there is still a good theory of standard modules. In motivating examples arising from Kac-Moody 2-categories, these modules categorify the PBW bases for the modified forms of quantum groups constructed by Wang.</p></details>

This class of rings lies properly between the classes of strongly nil-clean rings and strongly clean rings. In fact, it is proved the valuable criterion that a ring $R$ is strongly NUS-nil clean if, and only if, $a^4-a^2\in Nil(R)$ for every $a\not\in U(R)$. In particular, a ring $R$ with only trivial idempotents is strongly NUS-nil clean if, and only if, $R$ is a local ring with nil Jacobson radical.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a family of quantum algorithms for estimating Gowers uniformity norms $ U^k $ over finite abelian groups and demonstrate their applications to testing polynomial structure and counting arithmetic progressions. Building on recent work for estimating the $ U^2 $-norm over $ \mathbb{F}_2^n $, we generalize the construction to arbitrary finite fields and abelian groups for higher values of $ k $. Our algorithms prepare quantum states encoding finite differences and apply Fourier sampling to estimate uniformity norms, enabling efficient detection of structural correlations. As a key application, we show that for certain degrees $ d = 4, 5, 6 $ and under appropriate conditions on the underlying field, there exist quasipolynomial-time quantum algorithms that distinguish whether a bounded function $ f(x) $ is a degree-$ d $ phase polynomial or far from any such structure. These algorithms leverage recent inverse theorems for Gowers norms, together with amplitude estimation, to reveal higher-order algebraic correlations. We also develop a quantum method for estimating the number of 3-term arithmetic progressions in Boolean functions $ f : \mathbb{F}_p^n \to \{0,1\} $, based on estimating the $ U^2 $-norm. Though not as query-efficient as Grover-based counting, our approach provides a structure-sensitive alternative aligned with additive combinatorics. Finally, we demonstrate that our techniques remain valid under certain quantum noise models, due to the shift-invariance of Gowers norms. This enables noise-resilient implementations within the NISQ regime and suggests that Gowers-norm-based quantum algorithms may serve as robust primitives for quantum property testing, learning, and pseudorandomness.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The finitistic dimension conjecture is closely connected to the symmetry of the finitistic dimension. Recent work indicates that such connection extends to one of its upper bounds, the delooping level. In this paper, we show that the same holds for the derived delooping level, which is an improvement of the delooping level. This reduces the finitistic dimension conjecture to considering algebras whose opposite algebra has (derived) delooping level zero. We thereby demonstrate ways to utilize the new concept of derived delooping level to obtain new results and present additional work involving tensor product of algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Bj\"orner and Ekedahl [Ann. of Math. (2), 170.2(2009), pp. 799--817] pioneered the study of length-counting sequences associated with parabolic lower Bruhat intervals in crystallographic Coxeter groups. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of these sequences in affine Weyl groups. Let $W$ be an affine Weyl group with corresponding Weyl group $W_f$ and ${}^{f}{W}$ be the set of minimal representatives for the right cosets $W_f \backslash W$. Let $t_{\lambda}$ be the translation by a dominant coroot lattice element $\lambda$ and ${}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{\lambda}}$ be the number of elements of length $i$ below $t_\lambda$ in the Bruhat order on ${}^{f}{W}$. We show that the sequence $({}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{\lambda}})_i$ is ''asymptotically log-concave'' in the following sense: The sequence of discrete measures $(\mathfrak{m}_k)_k$ constructed from the $k$-fold dilated sequence $({}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{k\lambda}})_i$, as $k$ tends to infinity, converges weakly to a continuous measure obtained from a polytope $P^\lambda$. Moreover, the sequence of step functions $(S_k)_k$ of $({}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{k\lambda}})_i$ converges uniformly to the density function of this continuous measure. By Brunn--Minkowski inequality, this density is log-concave.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The characterization of permutations over finite fields is an important topic in number theory with a long-standing history. This paper presents a systematic investigation of low-degree bivariate polynomial systems $F=(f_1(x,y),f_2(x,y))$ defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q}^2$. Specifically, we employ Hermite's Criterion to completely classify bivariate quadratic permutation polynomial systems, while utilizing the theory of permutation rational functions to give a full classification of bivariate 3-homogeneous permutation polynomial systems. Furthermore, as an application of our findings, we provide an explicit characterization of the permutation binomials of the form $x^3+ax^{2q+1}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ with characteristic $p\neq3$, thereby resolving a significant special case within this classical research domain.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A matching from a finite subset $A$ of an abelian group $G$ to another subset $B$ is a bijection $f : A \to B$ such that $af(a) \notin A$ for all $a \in A$. The study of matchings began in the 1990s and was motivated by a conjecture of E. K. Wakeford on canonical forms for homogeneous polynomials. The theory was later extended to the linear setting of vector subspaces over field extensions, and then to matroids. In this paper, we investigate the existence and structure of matchings in both abelian groups and field extensions. Using Dyson's $e$-transform, a tool from additive combinatorics, along with a linear analogue which is introduced in this paper, we establish characterization theorems for matchable sets and subspaces. Several applications are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of these theorems as standalone tools. Throughout, we highlight the parallels between the group-theoretic and linear perspectives.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Supersingular elliptic curve isogeny graphs underlie isogeny-based cryptography. For isogenies of a single prime degree $\ell$, their structure has been investigated graph-theoretically. We generalise the notion of $\ell$-isogeny graphs to $L$-isogeny graphs (studied in the prime field case by Delfs and Galbraith), where $L$ is a set of small primes dictating the allowed isogeny degrees in the graph. We analyse the graph-theoretic structure of $L$-isogeny graphs. Our approaches may be put into two categories: cycles and graph cuts. On the topic of cycles, we provide: a count for the number of cycles in the $L$-isogeny graph with cyclic kernels using traces of Brandt matrices; an efficiently computable estimate based on this approach; and a third ideal-theoretic count for a certain subclass of $L$-isogeny cycles. We provide code to compute each of these three counts. On the topic of graph cuts, we compare several algorithms to compute graph cuts which minimise a measure called the edge expansion, outlining a cryptographic motivation for doing so. Our results show that a greedy neighbour algorithm out-performs standard spectral algorithms for computing optimal graph cuts. We provide code and study explicit examples. Furthermore, we describe several directions of active and future research.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K:k$ be a field extension and let $\Lambda$ be a finite-dimensional $k$-algebra. We investigate the relationship between $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda_K = \Lambda \otimes_k K$ with particular emphasis on various aspects of $\tau$-tilting theory and bricks. We show that many types of objects for $\Lambda$ lift injectively to the same type of object for $\Lambda_K$, and many common constructions in $\tau$-tilting theory commute with the process of extending the base field. One of our main applications is the construction of a faithful functor from the $\tau$-cluster morphism category $\mathfrak{W}(\Lambda)$ of $\Lambda$ to the $\tau$-cluster morphism category $\mathfrak{W}(\Lambda_K)$ of $\Lambda_K$. In particular, this establishes a faithful functor from $\mathfrak{W}(\Lambda)$ to a group whenever $k$ is of characteristic zero which has many important consequences. In the appendix, E. J. Hanson shows the analogous result whenever $k$ is a finite field. Moreover, we give some nontrivial examples to illustrate the behaviour of $\tau$-tilting finiteness under base field extension.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine the order of the largest of the twenty-six sporadic simple groups known as the Monster, using a straightforward computational approach. The Monster is here defined as a subgroup of the symmetry group of the 196884-dimensional Griess algebra generated by a group of type $2^{1+24}_+.Co_1$ and an additional triality automorphism. Our approach is based on counting arguments for certain idempotents of the Griess algebra called axes. Our proof is self-contained, requiring only established properties of the Conway group as the automorphism group of the Leech lattice, and some of its subgroups. Although our approach is conceptually simple, it requires extensive calculation inside a 196884-dimensional matrix group that current computer algebra systems cannot easily handle directly. Instead, we use the software package mmgroup, developed by the second author, which supports fast calculations inside the Monster. To our knowledge, this paper contains the first self-contained computation of the order of the Monster. The Monster also acts on the Moonshine module V^#, which is a vertex operator algebra of central charge c=24. We provide a new proof that the Monster is the full automorphism group of the Griess algebra and of the Moonshine module using Borcherds' proof of the Monstrous Moonshine conjectures. In addition, we show that the Monster has exactly two conjugacy classes of involutions. The order of the Baby Monster, the second largest of the sporadic simple groups, is also determined.</p></details>

We analyze the procedure of pulling back actions of tensor categories on module categories along tensor functors, and show that properties like pivotality and unimodularity are preserved if $F$ if $\otimes$-Frobenius. These results allow the transport of Frobenius algebras under certain conditions. We apply the results to internal natural transformations and examples coming from Hopf algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a new conjecture (Conjecture 1.1) on the structure of the unitary dual by means of the Arthur representations for general reductive algebraic groups defined over any non-Archimedean local field of characteristic zero. We also propose a conjecture (Conjecture 1.2) refining Conjecture 1.1 for representations of good parity. The relations among the two conjectures and special families of representations are explained in Figure 1. The main results include a partial approval of Conjecture 1.1 (Theorem 1.5); an algorithm to determine a candidate of the unitary dual (Algorithm 8.5); and the verification of Conjectures 1.1 and 1.2 for many known unitary duals, especially for representations of corank at most 3 for symplectic or split odd special orthogonal groups, based on Tadi{\'c}'s classification (Theorem 1.6), and G_2. To prove the main results, we develop new algorithms to determine whether a given irreducible representation is of Arthur type and give an inductive approach to classify the family of unitary representations that are of Arthur type for classical groups. We explicate this approach towards the unitary dual problem for representations of corank 3 and several new families of representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present two applications of the concept of higher idempotent completion to higher categories relevant in link homology theory and higher representation theory. We show that singular Soergel bimodules can be recovered from Soergel bimodules through partial 2-categorical idempotent completions. Specializing to type A, we further assemble singular Soergel bimodules into a semistrict monoidal 2-category and identify certain quotients as semistrict monoidal 2-categories of gl_N foams. Our second main result uses 2-categorical idempotent completions to formulate a higher categorical branching rule for such foam theories, which underlie the Lee-Gornik-Rasmussen-Wu deformations of coloured gl_N link homology. In particular, we provide a fully local version of Rose-Wedrich's decomposition theorem on deformed coloured link homology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Arithmetic properties of some families in $\frac{\mathbb{F}_l[x]}{\langle x^{p^sq^t}-1\rangle}$ are obtained by using the cyclotomic classes of order 2 with respect to $n=p^sq^t$, where $p\equiv3 \mathrm{mod} 4$, $\gcd(\phi(p^s),\phi(q^t))=2$, $l$ is a primitive root modulo $q^t$ and $\mathrm{ord}_{p^s}(l)=\phi(p^s)/2$. The form of these cyclotomic classes enables us to further generalize the results obtained in \cite{ref1}. The explicit expressions of primitive idempotents of minimal ideals in $\frac{\mathbb{F}_l[x]}{\langle x^{p^sq^t}-1\rangle}$ are also obtained.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Several authors have recently proved results which express a cusp form as a $p$-adic limit of weakly holomorphic modular forms under repeated application of Atkin's $U$-operator. Initially, these results had a deficiency: one could not rule out the possibility when a certain quantity vanishes and the final result fails to be true. Later on, Ahlgren and Samart \cite{AS} found a method to prove that no exceptions happen in the specific case considered by El-Guindy and Ono, Hanson and Jameson, and (independently) Dicks. generalized this method to finitely many other cases. In this paper, we present a different approach which allows us to prove a similar non-vanishing result for an infinite family of similar cases. Our approach also allows us to return back to the original example considered by El-Guindy and Ono, where we calculate the (manifestly non-zero) quantity explicitly in terms of Morita's $p$-adic $\Gamma$-function.</p></details>

This paper demonstrates a procedure for finding WZ pair candidates to prove a given supercongruence. When suitable WZ pairs are thus obtained, coupling them with the $p$-adic approximation of $\Gamma_p$ by Long and Ramakrishna enables uniform proofs for the Van Hamme supercongruences B.2, C.2, D.2, E.2, F.2, G.2, and H.2. This approach also yields the known extensions of G.2 modulo $p^4$, and of H.2 modulo $p^3$ when $p$ is $3$ modulo $4$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Inspired by the papers by Angelo and Xu, Q.J Math., 74, pp. 767-777, and improvements by Kerr and Klurman, arXiv:2211.05540, we study the probability that the weighted sums of a Rademacher random multiplicative function, $\sum_{n\leq x}f(n)n^{-\sigma}$, are positive for all $x\geq x_\sigma\geq 1$ in the regime $\sigma\to1/2^+$. In a previous paper by Heap, Zhao and the author, and by the author, when $0\leq \sigma\leq 1/2$ this probability is zero. Here we give a positive lower bound for this probability depending on $x_\sigma$ that becomes large as $\sigma\to1/2^+$. The main inputs in our proofs are a maximal inequality based in relatively high moments for these partial sums combined with a Bonami--Hal\'asz's moment inequality, and also explicit estimates for the partial sums of non-negative multiplicative functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The celebrated L\'evy--Khintchine theorem is a fundamental limiting law that describes the growth rate of the denominators of the convergents in the continued fraction expansion of a Lebesgue-typical real number. In a recent breakthrough, Cheung and Chevallier \textit{(Annales scientifiques de l'ENS, 2024)} extended this theorem to higher dimensions. In this paper, we resolve a conjecture of Y. Cheung and answer a question of Cheung and Chevallier concerning L\'evy--Khintchine type theorems for arbitrary norms. We also establish a higher-dimensional analogue of the Doeblin--Lenstra law. While our results are new in higher dimensions, they also yield significant improvements in the classical one-dimensional setting. Specifically, we revisit the L\'evy--Khintchine theorem and the Doeblin--Lenstra law through the lens of Mahler's influential proposal to study Diophantine approximation on fractals. In particular, we prove these results for almost every point on the middle-third Cantor set. More broadly, our framework applies to a wide class of measures, including those supported on curves and on self-similar fractals generated by iterated function systems (IFS), and it also allows constraints on the selection of best approximates.</p></details>

Let $\Pi$ be a finite length $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell$-representation (or an $\ell$-modular representation) of $G(E)\rtimes {\rm Gal}(E/F)$.

We discuss the explicit computation of these Tate cohomology groups when $G$ is ${\rm GL}_n$ and $\Pi$ is obtained as a base change lifting of a depth-zero cuspidal representation of ${\rm GL}_n(F)$. The primary novelty from our previous work is that we treat the case where $\Pi$ is possibly non-cuspidal.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Vertex algebras that arise from four-dimensional, $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories inherit a collection of novel structural properties from their four-dimensional ancestors. Crucially, when the parent SCFT is unitary, the corresponding vertex algebra is not unitary in the conventional sense. In this paper, we motivate and define a generalized notion of unitarity for vertex algebras that we call \emph{graded unitarity}, and which captures the consequences of four-dimensional unitarity under this correspondence. We also take the first steps towards a classification program for graded-unitary vertex algebras whose underlying vertex algebras are Virasoro or affine Kac--Moody vertex algebras. Remarkably, under certain natural assumptions about the $\mathfrak{R}$-filtration for these vertex algebras, we show that only the $(2,p)$ central charges for Virasoro VOAs and boundary admissible levels for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ Kac--Moody vertex algebras can possibly be compatible with graded unitarity. These are precisely the cases of these vertex algebras that are known to arise from four dimensions.</p></details>

We define $P^{\pm}$ to be the set of $\mu\in \mathfrak{h}^*$ paired with simple co-roots for $A_{ii}\geq 0$ as usual, but notably by negative multiples of $\frac{|A_{ii}|}{2}$ if $A_{ii}<0$. By-products of working with $P^{\pm}$: study of simples $L(\lambda)\ \forall\ \lambda\in P^{\pm}$, notably of $L(\rho)$ for Weyl vectors $\rho\in P^{\pm} \setminus P^+$, and their Verma covers; all novel to our best knowledge. For Weyl-Kac-Borcherds character type formulas of these $L(\lambda)$s over negative rank-2 $\mathfrak{g}$ and of $L(\rho)$ over negative $A_n$ type $\mathfrak{g}$ $\forall$ $n\in \mathbb{N}$, we explore : i) their presentations; ii) their Verma modules' structures; iii) problems on maximal vectors or Verma embeddings, from Kac-Kazhdan [Adv.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper addresses the interactions between three properties that a group algebra or more generally a pointed Hopf algebra may possess: being noetherian, having finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, and satisfying the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence. First it is shown that the second and third of these properties are equivalent for group algebras $kG$ of polycyclic-by-finite groups, and are, in turn, equivalent to $G$ being nilpotent-by-finite. In characteristic 0, this enables us to extend this equivalence to certain cocommutative Hopf algebras. In the second and third parts of the paper finiteness conditions for group algebras are studied. In the second section we examine when a group algebra satisfies the Goldie conditions, while in the final section we discuss what can be said about a minimal counterexample to the conjecture that if $kG$ is noetherian then G is polycyclic-by-finite.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is a paper in smooth $4$-manifold topology, inspired by the N\'{e}ron-Lang Theorem in number theory. More precisely, we prove that a smooth version $\MW(\pi)$ of Mordell-Weil group of an elliptic fibration $\pi:M\to\Pb^1$ is finitely generated. We compute $\MW(\pi_d)$ explicitly for elliptic fibrations $\pi_d:M_d\to\Pb^1$, where $M_d$ is a simply-connected complex surfaces $M_d$ of arithmetic genus $d\geq 1$ and all fibers of $\pi_d$ are nodal. We prove in this case that the fibered structure is unique up topological isotopy. By combining this with a result of Donaldson, we obtain the following remarkable consequence: any diffeomorphism of $M_d$ with $d\geq 3$ is topologically isotopic to a diffeomorphism taking fibers to fibers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of radical preservation and prove that a radical-preserving homomorphism of left artinian rings of finite projective dimension with superfluous kernel reflects the finiteness of the little finitistic, big finitistic and global dimension. As an application, we prove that every bound quiver algebra with quasi-uniform Loewy length, a class of algebras introduced in this paper, has finite (big) finitistic dimension. The same result holds more generally in the context of semiprimary rings. Moreover, we construct an explicit family of such finite dimensional algebras where the finiteness of their big finitistic dimension does not follow from existing results in the literature.</p></details>
