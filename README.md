 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Runbo Li &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 32 pages. Add some applications

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The author studies an average version of Brun-Titchmarsh theorem with large moduli. Using Maynard's recent breakthrough on the Bombieri-Friedlander-Iwaniec type triple convolution estimates, we refine the previous result of Baker and Harman (1996). As an application, we improve a result of Baker and Harman (1998) on shifted primes with a large prime factor, showing that the largest prime factor of $p - 1$ is larger than $p^{0.679}$ for infinitely many primes $p$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Moubariz Z. Garaev, Julio C. Pardo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a large prime number. We prove that any integer $\lambda$ modulo $p$ can be represented in the form $$ m!n! +\sum_{i=1}^{47}n_i!\equiv \lambda \pmod p, $$ with $\max\{m,n,n_1,\ldots,n_{47}\}\ll p^{1300/1301}.$ This improves the exponent $1350/1351$ of Garaev, Luca and Shparlinski (2005). Furthermore, we prove that any integer $\lambda$ can be represented in the form $$ m_1!n_1! +m_2!n_2!+m_3!n_3! +m_4!n_4!+m_5!n_5! \equiv \lambda \pmod p $$ with $\max\{m_1,n_1,\ldots,m_5,n_5\}\le p^{97/113 +o(1)}.$ This improves the exponent $27/28$ of Garaev and Garcia (2007). The proofs of these two results are based on the recent work of Grebennikov, Sagdeev, Semchankau and Vasilevskii (2024). We also obtain some lower bound estimates on the cardinality of the product set of two factorials modulo a prime. For instance, we prove that if $N<p^{3/5},$ then $$ \#\{m!n!\pmod p; \, 1\le m,n\le N\}\gg N^{1-o(1)}. $$ The proof of this result is based on works of Banks and Shparlinski (2020), Cilleruelo and Garaev (2016), and the work of Katz and Shen (2008) related to the Ruzsa-Pl\"unnecke inequality from additive combinatorics.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12311v2'>2412.12311</a>\]&nbsp; **Conditional Bounds for Prime Gaps with Applications**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jacques Grah &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 31 pages, new section 9 deals with twin prime conjecture

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We posit that $d_n^2 < 2p_{n+1}$ holds for all $n\geq 1$, where $p_n$ represents the $n$th prime and $d_n$ stands for the $n$th prime gap i.e. $d_n := p_{n+1} - p_n$. Then, the presence of a prime between successive perfect squares, as well as the validity of $\Delta_n := \sqrt{p_{n+1}} - \sqrt{p_n} < 1$ are derived. Next, $\pi(x)$ being the number of primes $p$ up to $x$, we deduce $\pi(n^2-n) < \pi(n^2) < \pi(n^2+n)$ $(n\geq 2)$. In addition, a proof of $\pi((n+1)^k) - \pi(n^k) \geq \pi(2^k)$ \ $(k\geq 2, n\geq 1)$ is worked out. The vanishing nature of $\Delta_n$ as $n$ goes to infinity is set, and used afterwards to achieve both $\displaystyle{\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}d_n/\sqrt{p_n} = 0}$ and the twin prime conjecture. Also, question about the estimate $p_n < 2j_n^2 \ (n\geq 6)$, where $j_n$ counts the twin prime pairs up to $p_n$, is raised. Finally, we put forward the conjecture that any rational number $r$ $(0\leq r \leq 1)$ represents an accumulation point of the sequence $\left(\{\sqrt{p_n}\}\right)_{n\geq 1}$, where $\{x\}$ acts for the fractional part of $x$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 24 pages, 12 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Perverse schobers can be used to describe Fukaya categories but are hard to axiomatize and construct. In this paper, we give an explicit construction of a perverse schober intended to accurately describe the Fukaya category of the horizontal Hilbert scheme considered by Aganagic et al. in the frame of the knot invariant categorification program. The formalism is based on the notion of $ A_n $-schobers of Dyckerhoff and Wedrich. The construction is entirely algebraic and we check the schober axioms with the help of diagrammatic calculus.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Owen Mackenzie, Fatemeh Rezaee &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We resolve the 1978 Brian\c{c}on-Iarrobino Conjecture regarding the maximum singularity of $\mathcal{H}=\mathrm{Hilb}^{l}(\mathbb{A}^3)$, where $l$ is a tetrahedral number, by refining the work of Ramkumar-Sammartano in \cite{Ramkumar-Sammartano}. This also immediately implies the conjectural necessary condition for a point of $\mathcal{H}$ to have the maximal singularity, suggested by the second-named author in \cite{Rezaee-23-Conjectures}. In a sequel to this article, \cite{Mackenzie-Rezaee2}, we prove a generalized version of this conjecture for certain non-tetrahedral $l$, via proving the conjectural necessary condition.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jasper van de Kreeke &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 21 pages, 3 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Spectral sequences are a common tool to compute cohomology spaces, but higher structure is often lost on the way. In this article we exhibit a strategy to retain the higher structure on the cohomology, which works in case the chain complex with higher structure is presented as the twisting of a simpler chain complex by a Maurer-Cartan element. This works particularly well in case of the Hochschild complex of a minimal $ A_\infty $-category, where the Hochschild complex can be seen as the twisting of the Hochschild complex of the underlying associative algebra or category. As an application, we recover the existing formality result for Hochschild cohomology of wrapped Fukaya categories of punctured surfaces, and provide an $ L_\infty $-quasi-isomorphism between the Hochschild complex and its cohomology.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sonagnon Julien Owolabi, Ibrahim Nonkane, Joel Tossa &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AC &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this note, we consider the resultant of systems of homogeneous multivariate polynomials which are equivariant under the action of direct product of two symmetric groups. We establish a decomposition formula for the resultant of such systems. Thanks to that decomposition formula we prove that the discriminant of an invariant multivariate homogeneous polynomial under a direct product of symmetric groups splits into smaller resultants that are easier to compute.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21710v1'>2508.21710</a>\]&nbsp; **A framework for proving quantum modularity: Application to Witten's asymptotic expansion conjecture**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yuya Murakami &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 63 pages, 13 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We address two linked problems at the interface of quantum topology and number theory: deriving asymptotic expansions of the Witten--Reshetikhin--Turaev invariants for 3-manifolds and establishing quantum modularity of false theta functions. Previous progress covers Seifert homology 3-spheres for the former and rank-one cases for the latter, both of which rely on single-variable integral representations. We extend these results to negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds and to general false theta functions, respectively. We address this limitation by developing two techniques: a Poisson summation formula with signature and a framework of modular series, both of which enable a precise and explicit analysis of multivariable integral representations. As further applications, our method yields a unified approach to proving quantum modularity for false theta functions, indefinite theta functions, and for Eisenstein series of odd weight.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 63 pages, 8 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the distribution of quadratic Gauss paths, polygonal paths joining partial sums of quadratic Gauss sums to square-free fundamental discriminant moduli in a dyadic range [Q,2Q]. We prove that this striking ensemble converges in law, as Q->\infty, to a random Fourier series we explicitly describe, and we prove a convergence in probability result and a classification result for the limiting shapes that explain the visually remarkable properties of these Gauss paths.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Lawrence Dillon, Xiaoyao Huang, Say-Yeon Kwon, Meiling Laurence, Steven J. Miller, Vishal Muthuvel, Luke Rowen, Pramana Saldin, Steven Zanetti &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 57 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Katz-Sarnak density conjecture states that, as the analytic conductor $R \to \infty$, the distribution of the normalized low-lying zeros (those near the central point $s = 1/2$) converges to the scaling limits of eigenvalues clustered near 1 of subgroups of $U(N)$. There is extensive evidence supporting this conjecture for many families, including the family of holomorphic cusp newforms. Interestingly, there are very few choices for the main term of the limiting behavior. In 2009, S. J. Miller computed lower-order terms for the 1-level density of families of elliptic curve $L$-functions and compared to cuspidal newforms of prime level; while the main terms agreed, the lower order terms depended on the arithmetic of the family. We extend his work by identifying family-dependent lower-order correction terms in the weighted 1-level and 2-level densities of holomorphic cusp newforms up to $O\left(1/\log^4 R\right)$ error, sharpening Miller's $O\left(1/\log^3 R\right)$ error. We consider cases where the level is prime or when the level is a product of two, not necessarily distinct, primes. We show that the rates at which the prime factors of the level tend to infinity lead to different lower-order terms, breaking the universality of the main behavior.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21671v1'>2508.21671</a>\]&nbsp; **Markoff triples and generating pairs of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** João Campos-Vargas &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Undergraduate senior thesis, Princeton University (2021)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Consider the level sets of the Markoff equation $$\mathrm{M}_k: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xyz - 2 = k.$$ The phenomenon of strong approximation, as named by Bourgain, Gamburd, and Sarnak, predicts that every solution of $\mathrm{M}_k$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$ descends from a solution over $\mathbb{Z}$. Moreover, we expect that the action of Vieta involutions (taking $(x, y, z)$ to $(yz-x, y, z)$, $(x, xz-y, z)$, and $(x, y, xy-z)$) on $\mathrm{M}_k(\mathbb{F}_p)$ is essentially transitive. In terms of matrices, Vieta involutions correspond to Nielsen moves in pairs $(A, B) \in \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p) \times \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ for which $\mathrm{tr}([A, B]) = k$. This correspondence is induced by $$\mathrm{Tr}: (A, B) \mapsto (\mathrm{tr}(A), \mathrm{tr}(B), \mathrm{tr}(AB)).$$ McCullough and Wanderley conjectured that Nielsen moves connect two pairs $(A_1, B_1)$, $(A_2, B_2)$ of generators of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ if and only if $[A_1, B_1]$ is conjugate to $[A_2, B_2]$ or $[B_2, A_2]$. Based on this, one expects that generating pairs $(A, B)$ of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ for which $\mathrm{tr}([A, B]) = k$ determine a single orbit of $\mathrm{M}_k(\mathbb{F}_p)$, and the remaining exceptional orbits come from non-generating pairs of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$. In this article, we describe the set of exceptional orbits of $\mathrm{M}_k(\mathbb{F}_p)$, showing that they agree with the finite orbits of the equation $\mathrm{M}_k$ over $\mathbb{C}$ found by Dubrovin and Mazzocco. Furthermore, we prove that the conjecture of McCullough and Wanderley is equivalent to strong approximation when $p \equiv 3 \mod{4}$. Lastly, we present the recent developments of Chen on the problem and use our classification of exceptional orbits to make a divisibility conjecture about the size of the largest orbit of $\mathrm{M}_k(\mathbb{F}_p)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages, added a corollary of main result

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero over which every diagonal form in sufficiently many variables admits a nontrivial solution. For example, $K$ may be a totally imaginary number field or a finite extension of a $p$-adic field. Suppose $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ are forms of degree $d$ over $K.$ Bik, Draisma and Snowden recently proved that there exists a constant $B = B(d,s,K)$ such that the rational solutions to the system of equations $f_1=\ldots=f_s = 0$ are Zariski dense, as long as the Birch rank of $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ is greater than $B.$ We establish an effective bound for this constant, improving vastly on the astronomical bound coming from their proof. Our result has applications for surjectivity of polynomial maps and for the Hardy-Littlewood circle method.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be a nilpotent ideal in the Borel subalgebra $\mathfrak{b}$ of a complex finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra, and $\mathfrak{m}^{\bullet}$ the subset of (ad-)nilpotent elements in $\mathfrak{b}$ such that $\mathfrak{m}$ is the minimal ideal containing them. This set is stable under the adjoint action of the corresponding Borel subgroup $B$. We prove that $\mathfrak{m}^{\bullet}$ contains a unique closed $B$-orbit which is the orbit of a nilpotent element whose support is the set of minimal roots associated to the root space decomposition of $\mathfrak{m}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 43 pages and 1 figure. Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We initiate the mathematical study of the boundary Carrollian conformal algebra (BCCA), an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra recently discovered in the context of Carrollian physics. The BCCA is an intriguing object from both physical and mathematical perspectives, since it is a filtered but not graded Lie algebra. In this paper, we first construct some modules for the BCCA and one of its subalgebras, which we call $\mathcal{O}$, by restriction of well-known modules of the BMS$_3$ and Witt algebras respectively. After showing that such modules are free or ``almost free'', we go through some structure theory on the BCCA to define a new basis and a decreasing filtration on the algebra which lets us construct BCCA-modules intrinsically. In particular, we construct Whittaker modules over the BCCA and the subalgebra $\mathcal{O}$ and prove criteria for their irreducibility.</p></details>

Our result on the exact order of the discrepancy supports the well-established conjecture in the theory of uniform distribution, which states that $D_N\leq c \frac{\log^s N}{N}$, with $c>0$ for all $N>1$ is the best possible upper bound for the discrepancy $D_N$ of a sequence in $[0,1)^s$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ without complex multiplication, Lang and Trotter conjecture $$ \# \{ p<X \mid E \text{ has a supersingular reduction at } p \} \sim \frac{c\sqrt{X}}{\log X} $$ as $X \rightarrow \infty$, where $c>0$ is a constant depending only on $E$. Fourvy and Murty obtained an average estimation related to the Lang-Trotter conjecture, called the Lang-Trotter conjecture on average. We considered the Lang-Trotter conjecture for curves of genus 2, and obtained a similar result to the Lang-Trotter conjecture on average for the family of curves $C_{\lambda}:y^2=x(x-1)(x+1)(x-{\lambda})(x-1/ \lambda)$. Such curves are characterized as curves of genus two with reduced automorphism group containing the Klein $4$-group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime number and $\zeta_p$ a primitive $p$-th root of unity. Chebotarev's theorem states that every square submatrix of the $p \times p$ matrix $(\zeta_p^{ij})_{i,j=0}^{p-1}$ is non-singular. In this paper we prove the same for principal submatrices of $(\zeta_n^{ij})_{i,j=0}^{n-1}$, when $n=pr$ is the product of two distinct primes, and $p$ is a large enough prime that has order $r-1$ in $\mathbf{Z}_r^*$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A cluster algebra is an algebraic structure generated by operations of a quiver (a directed graph) called the mutations and their associated simple birational mappings. By using a graph-combinatorial approach, we present a systematic way to derive a tropical, i.e. subtraction-free birational, representation of Weyl groups from cluster algebras. Our results provide an extensive class of Weyl group actions, including previously known examples with algebro-geometric background, and hence are relevant to the q-Painleve equations and their higher-order extensions. Key ingredients of the argument are the combinatorial aspects of the reflection associated with a cycle subgraph in the quiver. We also study symplectic structures of the discrete dynamical systems thus obtained. The normal form of a skew-symmetric integer matrix allows us to choose Darboux coordinates while preserving the birationality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $n\geq 2$, let $\Gamma\subset \mathrm{SU}((n,1),\mathcal{O}_{K})$ be a torsion-free, finite-index subgroup, where $\mathcal{O}_K$ denotes the ring of integers of a totally imaginary number field $K$ of degree $2$. Let $\mathbb{B}^n$ denote the $n$-dimensional complex ball endowed with the hyperbolic metric, and let $X_{\Gamma}:=\Gamma\backslash \mathbb{B}^n$ denote the quotient space. Furthermore, let $\mu_{\mathrm{hyp}}^{\mathrm{vol}}$ denote the volume form associated to the hyperbolic metric. Let $\Lambda:=\Omega_{\overline{X}_{\Gamma}}^{n}$ denote the line bundle, where $\overline{X}_{\Gamma}:=X_{\Gamma}\cup\lbrace \infty\rbrace$. For any $k\geq 1$, let $\lambda^{k}:=\Lambda^{\otimes k}\otimes O_{\overline{X}_{\Gamma}}((k-1)\infty)$. For any $k\geq 1$, the hyperbolic metric induces a point-wise metric on $H^{0}(\overline{X}_{\Gamma},\lambda^{k})$. For any $k\geq 1$, let $\mathcal{B}_{X_{\Gamma}}^{\lambda^{k}}$ denote the Bergman kernel associated $H^{0}(\overline{X}_{\Gamma},\lambda^{k})$. Then, for $k\gg1$, the first main result of the article, is the following estimate $$ \sup_{z\in \overline{X}_{\Gamma}}\big|\mathcal{B}_{X_{\Gamma}}^{\lambda^{k}}(z,z)\big|_{\mathrm{hyp}}=O_{X_{\Gamma}}(k^{n+1/2}).$$ For any $k\geq 1$, and $z\in X_{\Gamma}$, let $\mu_{\mathrm{Ber},k}(z)$ denote the Bergman metric associated to the line bundle $\lambda^{ k}$, and let $\mu_{\mathrm{ber},k}^{\mathrm{vol}}$ denote the associated volume form. Then, for $k\gg1$, the second main result of the article is the following estimate $$ \sup_{z\in \overline{X}_{\Gamma}}\bigg|\frac{\mu_{\mathrm{Ber},k}^{\mathrm{vol}}(z)}{\mu_{\mathrm{hyp}}^{\mathrm{vol}}(z)}\bigg|=O_{X_{\Gamma}}\big(k^{2(n-1)(n+1)+n+3} \big).$$ Our estimate for the Bergman metric completes our arguments and corrects our estimate from arXiv:2305.11609, for $n=1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a fixed $z\in\mathbb{C}$ and a fixed $k\in\mathbb{N}$, let $\sigma_{z}^{(k)}(n)$ denote the sum of $z$-th powers of those divisors $d$ of $n$ whose $k$-th powers also divide $n$. This arithmetic function is a simultaneous generalization of the well-known divisor function $\sigma_z(n)$ as well as the divisor function $d^{(k)}(n)$ first studied by Wigert. The Dirichlet series of $\sigma_{z}^{(k)}(n)$ does not fall under the purview of Chandrasekharan and Narasimhan's fundamental work on Hecke's functional equation with multiple gamma factors. Nevertheless, as we show here, an explicit and elegant Vorono\"{\dotlessi} summation formula exists for this function. As its corollaries, some transformations of Wigert are generalized. The kernel $H_{z}^{(k)}(x)$ of the associated integral transform is a new generalization of the Bessel kernel. Several properties of this kernel such as its differential equation, asymptotic behavior and its special values are derived. A crucial relation between $H_{z}^{(k)}(x)$ and an associated integral $K_{z}^{(k)}(x)$ is obtained, the proof of which is deep, and employs the theory of linear differential equations and the properties of Stirling numbers of the second kind and elementary symmetric polynomials.</p></details>

As an intermediate result we give an explicit description of the Picard-Vessiot rings and of the Galois groups associated to the operators in the image of the Carlitz module, using techniques inspired by the Carlitz-Hayes theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod $n$ homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}.$ As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod $n$ homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected and area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 60 pages, 4 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Duke, Imamo\=glu, and T\'oth have recently constructed a new geometric invariant, a hyperbolic orbifold, associated to each narrow ideal class of a real quadratic field. Furthermore, they have shown that the projection of these hyperbolic orbifolds onto the modular surface $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}$ equidistributes on average over a genus of the narrow class group as the fundamental discriminant $D$ of the real quadratic field tends to infinity. We extend this construction of hyperbolic orbifolds to allow for a level structure, akin to Heegner points and closed geodesics of level $q$. Additionally, we refine this equidistribution result in several directions. First, we investigate sparse equidistribution in the level aspect, where we prove the equidistribution of level $q$ hyperbolic orbifolds when restricted to a translate of $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}$ in $\Gamma_0(q) \backslash \mathbb{H}$, which presents some new interesting features. Second, we explore sparse equidistribution in the subgroup aspect, namely equidistribution on average over small subgroups of the narrow class group. Third, we prove small scale equidistribution and give upper bounds for the discrepancy. Behind these refinements is a new interpretation of the Weyl sums arising in these equidistribution problems in terms of ad\`elic period integrals, which in turn are related to Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions via Waldspurger's formula. The key remaining inputs are hybrid subconvex bounds for these $L$-functions and a certain homological version of the sup-norm problem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A cryptarithm (or alphametic) is a mathematical puzzle in which numbers are represented with words in such a way that identical letters stand for equal digits and distinct letters for unequal digits. An alphametic puzzle is usually given in the form of an equation that needs to be solved, such as SEND + MORE = MONEY. Alternatively, here we will consider cryptarithms constrained not by an equation but by a particular subsequence of natural numbers, for example perfect squares or primes. Such a cryptarithm has a unique solution if there is exactly one term in the sequence that has the corresponding pattern of digits. We will call such terms cryptarithmically unique. Here we estimate the density of such terms in an arbitrary sequence for which the overall density of terms among integers is known. In particular, among all perfect squares below 10^12, slightly less than one half are cryptarithmically unique, their density increasing toward larger numbers. Cryptarithmically unique prime numbers, however, are initially very scarce. Combinatorial estimates suggest that their density should drop below 10^-300 for decimal lengths of approximately 1829 digits, but then it recovers and is asymptotic to unity for very large primes. Finally, we introduce and discuss primonumerophobic digit patterns that no prime number happens to have.</p></details>

This rather natural sequence is sequence A283190 in the OEIS and while some basic facts are known, it seems that surprisingly it has barely been studied. First, we prove that $s(n) = c \cdot n + O(n/(\log n \log \log n))$, where $c$ is an explicit constant. Then we focus on differences between consecutive terms $s(n)$ and $s(n+1)$. It turns out that the value can always increase by at most one, but there exist arbitrarily large decreases. We show that the differences are bounded by $O(\log \log n)$. Finally, we consider ''iterated remainder sets''. These are related to a problem arising from Pierce expansions, and we prove bounds for the size of these sets as well.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Suppose $\Gamma < \mathrm{PU}(n,1)$ is a cocompact arithmetic lattice of simplest type with profinite completion $\widehat{\Gamma}$. This paper proves there is an open subgroup $\widehat{\Gamma}_0 \le \widehat{\Gamma}$ such that $H^j(\widehat{\Delta}, \mathbb{F}_p)$ is nontrivial for every open subgroup ${\widehat{\Delta} \le \widehat{\Gamma}_0}$, $j \le 2n$, and sufficiently large prime $p$. If $n \ge 2$, nonvanishing is new for all $j \ge 2$. Consequently, the virtual cohomological dimension of $\widehat{\Gamma}$ is at least $2n$, improving the previous lower bound of $1$. The proof shows there is a profinite fundamental class for the associated ball quotient and that its canonical class is profinite modulo torsion. For congruence $\Gamma$ and $j < \frac{n+1}{2}$, restriction ${H^j(\widehat{\Gamma}, \mathbb{F}_p) \to H^j(\Gamma, \mathbb{F}_p)}$ is shown to be almost surjective in a precise sense; this is related to whether lattices in $\mathrm{PU}(n,1)$ are good in the sense of Serre, which is only known to hold for $n=1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a Dirichlet series $L(s) = \sum a_n n^{-s}$, the asymptotic growth rate of $\sum_{n\le X} a_n$ can be determined by a Tauberian theorem. Bounds on the error term are typically controlled by the size of $|L(\sigma+it)|$ for fixed real part $\sigma$. We modify this approach to prove new Tauberian theorems with error terms depending only on the average size of $L(\sigma+it)$ as $t$ varies, and we take care to track explicit dependence on various parameters. This often leads to stronger error bounds, and introduces strong connections between asymptotic counting problems and moments of $L$-functions. We provide self-contained statements of Tauberian theorems in anticipation that these results can be used ``out of the box'' to prove new asymptotic expansions. We demonstrate this by proving square root saving error bounds for the number of $C_n$-extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ of bounded discriminant when $n=3$, $4$, $8$, $16$, or $2p$ for $p$ an odd prime.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1908, Voronoi introduced an algorithm that solves the lattice packing problem in any dimension in finite time. Voronoi showed that any lattice with optimal packing density must be a so-called perfect lattice, and his algorithm enumerates the finitely many perfect lattices up to similarity in a fixed dimension. However, due to the high complexity of the algorithm this enumeration had, until now, only been completed up to dimension 8. In this work we compute all 2237251040 perfect lattices in dimension 9 via Voronoi's algorithm. As a corollary, this shows that the laminated lattice $\Lambda_9$ gives the densest lattice packing in dimension 9. Equivalently, we show that the Hermite constant $\gamma_9$ in dimension 9 equals $2$. Furthermore, we extend a result by Watson (1971) and show that the set of possible kissing numbers in dimension 9 is precisely $2 \cdot \{ 1, \ldots, 91, 99, 120, \ldots, 129, 136 \}$.</p></details>

In order to completely understand the closure of $X(k)$ in the set of $S$-adelic points $X(\mathbb{A}_k^S)$, we ask: (i) whether $\mathrm{pr}_S(X(\mathbb{A}_k)^{\mathrm{br}})$ is closed in $X(\mathbb{A}_k^S)$; (ii) whether $X(k)$ is dense in the closed subset of $X(\mathbb{A}_k^S)$ cut out by elements in $\mathrm{br}X$ which induce zero evaluation maps at all the places in $S$. We also ask these questions considering only the algebraic Brauer group. We give answers to such questions for homogeneous spaces $X$ under semisimple simply connected groups with commutative stabilizers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we introduce the definition of equal-difference cyclotomic coset, and prove that in general any cyclotomic coset can be decomposed into a disjoint union of equal-difference subsets. Among the equal-difference decompositions of a cyclotomic coset, an important class consists of those in the form of cyclotomic decompositions, called the multiple equal-difference representations of the coset. There is an equivalent correspondence between the multiple equal-difference representations of $q$-cyclotomic cosets modulo $n$ and the irreducible factorizations of $X^{n}-1$ in binomial form over finite extension fields of $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. We give an explicit characterization of the multiple equal-difference representations of any $q$-cyclotomic coset modulo $n$, through which a criterion for $X^{n}-1$ factoring into irreducible binomials is obtained. In addition, we present an algorithm to simplify the computation of the leaders of cyclotomic cosets.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a generalized class of weighted $k$-regular partitions defined by $$ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_{k, r_1, r_2}(n) q^n = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(1 - q^{nk})^{r_1}}{(1 - q^n)^{r_2}}, $$ which extends the classical $k$-regular partition function $b_k(n)$. We establish new infinite families of Ramanujan-type congruences, divisibility results, and positive-density prime sets for which $c_{k, r_1, r_2}(n)$ vanishes modulo a given prime. These results generalize recent work on $5$-regular partitions and reveal deeper modular and combinatorial structures underlying weighted partition functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a linear--independence principle for finite families of translates in irreducible, square--integrable modulo the center (SI/Z) representations of step--two nilpotent Lie groups with one--dimensional center. Fix a one--parameter subgroup $\exp(\mathbb R X)$ and a noncentral element $Y$ (not assumed to commute with $X$). For every nonzero smooth vector $f$, any finite collection $\{\pi(\exp(x_k X))f\}_{k=1}^m$ (with distinct parameters $x_k$) of translates along $\exp(\mathbb R X)$, together with the single translate $\pi(\exp Y)f$, is linearly independent. The proof combines Schwartz regularity of matrix coefficients in the noncentral variables with an ergodic log--product estimate on a compact torus generated by commutator phases. As a result, we obtain an HRT--type statement for $(m,1)$ configurations (on--line direction with zero $X_{k_0}$--component and rogue $\exp X_{k_0}$) for all nonzero Schwartz windows, without spacing restrictions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>95 years ago Hoheisel proved the existence of primes in the sub-linear interval $$ \left[x, x+x^{1-{1\over 33000}}\right] \qquad \hbox{for $x$ sufficiently large}. $$ This was improved by Heilbronn, proving existence of primes in the interval $$ \left[x, x+x^{1-{1\over 250}}\right] \qquad \hbox{for $x$ sufficiently large}. $$ More recently Baker, Harman, Pintz proved existence of primes in the interval $$ \left[x, x+ x^{1-{19\over 40}}\right] \qquad \hbox{for $x$ sufficiently large}. $$ In the present article I will, to the extent possible, make some of these statements effective. Specifically, among other things, I shall show that $$ \forall n \geq 4, \qquad\forall x \geq \exp(\exp(33)), \qquad \hbox{there are primes in the interval} \left[x, x+ x^{1-{1\over n}}\right]; $$ $$ \forall n \geq 91, \qquad\forall x \geq [90^{90}]^{n/(n-90)} , \qquad \hbox{there are primes in the interval} \left[x, x+ x^{1-{1\over n}}\right]. $$ Furthermore $$ \forall n \geq 106, \qquad\forall x \geq 1, \qquad \hbox{there are primes in the interval} \left[x, x+ x^{1-{1\over n}}\right]. $$ In particular this last observation makes both the Hoheisel and Heilbronn results fully explicit and effective.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Arborified multiple zeta values are a generalization of multiple zeta values associated with rooted trees. There are two types of decorated rooted trees, corresponding respectively to the series and the integral expressions. Manchon introduces the contracting arborification (resp. the simple arborification), which is maps from the BCK Hopf algebras of the decorated rooted trees corresponding to the series expression (resp. the integral expression) to the non-commutative polynomial algebras of the set $\mathbb{N}$ (resp. the set $\{0,1\}$). There is a natural map between the two non-commutative polynomial algebras. Manchon posed the question of finding a natural map between the two BCK Hopf algebras that would make the diagram commutative. In this paper, we consider planar rooted trees and use a recursive method to construct such a map between the two BCK Hopf algebras, making the diagram commutative.</p></details>

Then we find gaps in the spectra and give a bound on Hall's ray.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A well-known and fundamental property of the Macdonald polynomials $P_\lambda(x;q,t)$ is their invariance under the transformation sending $(q,t)$ to $(q^{-1},t^{-1})$. Recently, Concha and Lapointe showed that this property extends in an interesting, nontrivial way to an identity for partially symmetric Macdonald polynomials. Their identity played a key role in the work of Bechtloff Weising and Orr linking partially symmetric Macdonald polynomials to parabolic flag Hilbert schemes. In this paper, we refine the Concha-Lapointe identity to a sub-family of Alexandersson's permuted basement Macdonald polynomials and give a combinatorial proof of the refined identity. We show also that the Concha-Lapointe identity is equivalent to the assertion that (normalized) partially symmetric Macdonald polynomials are fixed under the Kazhdan-Lusztig involution.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages, latex; new section 4 of rigidity of braided non-semisimple r-categories added in v2

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a field, and let $\mathcal{C}$ be a Cauchy complete $k$-linear braided category with finite dimensional morphism spaces and ${{\rm End}(\bf 1)}=k$. We call an indecomposable object $X$ of $\mathcal C$ non-negligible if there exists $Y\in \mathcal{C}$ such that $\bf 1$ is a direct summand of $Y\otimes X$. We prove that every non-negligible object $X\in \mathcal{C}$ such that ${\rm dim}{\rm End}(X^{\otimes n})<n!$ for some $n$ is automatically rigid. In particular, if $\mathcal{C}$ is semisimple of moderate growth and weakly rigid, then $\mathcal{C}$ is rigid. As applications, we simplify Huang's proof of rigidity of representation categories of certain vertex operator algebras, and we get that for a finite semisimple monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$, the data of a $\mathcal{C}$-modular functor is equivalent to a modular fusion category structure on $\mathcal{C}$, answering a question of Bakalov and Kirillov. Finally, we show that if $\mathcal{C}$ is rigid and has moderate growth, then the quantum trace of any nilpotent endomorphism in $\mathcal{C}$ is zero. Hence $\mathcal{C}$ admits a semisimplification, which is a semisimple braided tensor category of moderate growth. Finally, we discuss rigidity in braided r-categories which are not semisimple, which arise in logarithmic conformal field theory. These results allow us to simplify a number of arguments of Kazhdan and Lusztig.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Version 2: Removed Remark 2.1, which contained an imprecise application of Harish-Chandra's theory. The main results of the paper are unaffected by this removal

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper explicitly constructs a family of weight-shifting operators mapping from the space of weight-k smooth automorphic functions, A_k(Gamma), to the space of weight-t automorphic functions, A_t(Gamma). These operators are defined as integral transforms whose kernel, K, is the product of the covariant factor P given in Definition 1.2 and a function, F, which is invariant under the diagonal action of SL(2, R). The key assumption in the operator's construction is the spectral condition posited in Hypothesis 1.1, namely that the kernel K is an eigenfunction of the weight-t hyperbolic Laplacian Delta_t with respect to the first variable. This partial differential equation reduces to an ordinary differential equation for the invariant function F, which is shown to be equivalent to the Hypergeometric Differential Equation (HDE). The main result of this paper, presented in Theorem 2.1, is the explicit determination of the HDE parameters (a,b,c) as functions of the initial automorphic data (k, t, q) and the operator's spectral parameter lambda_K. This work presents an analytic methodology for the explicit construction of an intertwining operator that maps a Laplacian eigenspace to its corresponding eigenspace, demonstrating how the kernel is determined from the automorphic data via the Hypergeometric Differential Equation.</p></details>

The same method applied to the Korobov--Vinogradov zero-free region gives a new record: the unconditional bound $1/\zeta(\sigma +it) \ll (\log t)^{2/3}(\log\log t)^{1/4}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The $\frak{sl}_2$ KZ differential equations with values in the tensor power of the fundamental representation with parameter $\kappa=\pm 2$ are considered. A Satake-type correspondence is established over complex numbers and subsequently reduced to finite characteristic. This correspondence enables the study of the KZ equations on the lower weight subspaces of the tensor power in terms of the wedge powers of the weight subspace of the weight just below the highest weight. We apply this approach to analyze the $p$-curvature operators associated with our KZ equations, evaluate the dimension of the solution space in characteristic $p$, and determine whether all solutions are generated by the so-called $p$-hypergeometric solutions. In particular, we show that not all solutions of the KZ equations with $\kappa=2$ in characteristic $p$ are generated by $p$-hypergeometric solutions.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and analyze the ordered Zeckendorf game, a novel combinatorial two-player game inspired by Zeckendorf's Theorem, which guarantees a unique decomposition of every positive integer as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Building on the original Zeckendorf game\ -- previously studied in the context of unordered multisets\ -- we impose a new constraint: all moves must respect the order of summands. The result is a richer and more nuanced strategic landscape that significantly alters game dynamics. Unlike the classical version, where Player 2 has a dominant strategy for all $n > 2$, our ordered variant reveals a more balanced and unpredictable structure. In particular, we find that Player 1 wins for nearly all values $n \leq 25$, with a single exception at $n = 18$. This shift in strategic outcomes is driven by our game's key features: adjacency constraints that limit allowable merges and splits to neighboring terms, and the introduction of a switching move that reorders pairs. We prove that the game always terminates in the Zeckendorf decomposition\ -- now in ascending order\ -- by constructing a strictly decreasing monovariant. We further establish bounds on game complexity: the shortest possible game has length exactly $n - Z(n)$, where $Z(n)$ is the number of summands in the Zeckendorf decomposition of $n$, while the longest game exhibits quadratic growth, with $M(n) \sim \frac{n^2}{2}$ as $n \to \infty$. Empirical simulations suggest that random game trajectories exhibit log-normal convergence in their move distributions. Overall, the ordered Zeckendorf game enriches the landscape of number-theoretic games, posing new algorithmic challenges and offering fertile ground for future exploration into strategic complexity, probabilistic behavior, and generalizations to other recurrence relations.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 14 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish an effective Bertini-type theorem for hypersurfaces $X_f \colon f = 0$ defined over a finite field $k$ for which $f$ has no linear factors over the algebraic closure $\overline{k}$. Given a line $L$ defined over $k$ and a nonreduced $\overline{k}$-point $x$ on $X_f \cap L$, we give an upper bound on the number of planes $P$ containing $L$ for which $X_f \cap P$ contains a line through $x$. Underlying this result is a factorization algorithm for bivariate polynomials originally due to Kaltofen, which we present with slightly relaxed hypotheses. Our primary application is to Artin's conjecture on $p$-adic forms of degree 7: if $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is a finite extension with residue field isomorphic to $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $F(x_0, \ldots, x_n) \in K[x_0, \ldots, x_{49}]$ is a homogeneous form of degree 7, then there exists a $K$-solution to $F=0$ whenever $q>679$. This improves on a result of Wooley.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A hyperbinary partition of the nonnegative integer n is a partition where every part is a power of 2 and every part appears at most twice. We give three applications of the length generating function for such partitions, denoted by h_q(n). Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko defined the q-analogue of a rational number [r/s]_q in various ways, most of which depend directly or indirectly on the continued fraction expansion of r/s. As our first application we show that [r/s]_q = q h_q(n-1)/h_q(n) where r/s occurs as the nth entry in the Calkin-Wilf enumeration of the non-negative rationals. Next we consider fence posets which are those which can be obtained from a sequence of chains by alternately pasting together maxima and minima. For every n we show there is a fence poset F(n) whose lattice of order ideals is isomorphic to the poset of hyperbinary partitions of n ordered by refinement. For our last application, Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko also showed that [r/s]_q can be computed by taking products of certain matrices which are q-analogues of the standard generators for the special linear group SL(2,R). We express the entries of these products in terms of the polynomials h_q(n).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Zeckendorf proved that every positive integer can be written as a decomposition of non-adjacent Fibonacci numbers. Baird-Smith, Epstein, Flint, and Miller converted the process of decomposing an integer $n$ into a 2-player game, using the moves of $F_i + F_{i-1} = F_{i+1}$ and $2F_i = F_{i+1} + F_{i-2}$, where $F_i$ is the $ith$ Fibonacci number. They showed non-constructively that for $n \neq 2$, Player 2 has a winning strategy: a constructive solution remains unknown. We expand on this by investigating ``black hole'' variants of this game. The $F_m$ Black Hole Zeckendorf game is played with any $n$ but solely in columns $F_i$ for $i < m$. Gameplay is similar to the original Zeckendorf game, except any piece that would be placed on $F_i$ for $i \geq m$ is locked out in a ``black hole'' and removed from play. With these constraints, we analyze the games with black holes on $F_3$ and $F_4$ and construct a solution for specific configurations, using a non-constructive proof to lead to a constructive one. We also examine a pre-game in which players take turns placing down $n$ pieces in the outermost columns before the decomposition phase, and find constructive solutions for any $n$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish uniform bounds on the multiplicities of irreducible admissible representations appearing in spaces of functions on symmetric spaces over $p$-adic fields. These multiplicities can exceed one and depend intricately on the group, the space, and the representation, making exact computations often infeasible. This motivates the search for bounds depending only on simple structural parameters. More precisely, let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a non-Archimedean local field $F$ of odd residual characteristic, and let $\theta$ be a rational involution with fixed-point subgroup $H = G^\theta$. For any unramified smooth character $\chi$ of $H$, we show that the multiplicity $$ \dim \mathrm{Hom}_G(\rho, C^\infty(G/H,\chi)) $$ is uniformly bounded for a broad class of irreducible admissible representations $\rho$ of $G$, conjecturally including all such representations. The bound depends only on the rank of $G$ and the residue degree of $F$. Our method combines Mackey theory with cohomological techniques. As an application, we deduce a uniform bound on such multiplicities for all but finitely many local completions of a fixed number field.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of brick-splitting torsion pairs as a modern analogue and generalization of the classical notion of splitting torsion pairs. A torsion pair is called brick-splitting if any given brick is either torsion or torsion-free with respect to that torsion pair. After giving some properties of these pairs, we fully characterize them in terms of some lattice-theoretical properties, including left modularity. This leads to the notion of brick-directed algebras, which are those for which there does not exist any cycle of non-zero non-isomorphisms between bricks. This class of algebras is a novel generalization of representation-directed algebras. We show that brick-directed algebras have many interesting properties and give several characterizations of them. In particular, we prove that a brick-finite algebra is brick-directed if and only if the lattice of torsion classes is left modular (or equivalently, extremal). We also give a characterization of brick-directed algebras in terms of their wall-and-chamber structure, as well as of a certain Newton polytope associated to them. Moreover, we introduce an explicit construction of an abundance of brick-directed algebras, both of the tame and wild representation types.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the Habiro ring of a number field $\mathbb{K}$ and modules over it graded by $K_3(\mathbb{K})$. Elements of these modules are collections of power series at each complex root of unity that arithmetically glue with each other after applying a Frobenius endomorphism, and after dividing at each prime by a collection of series that depends solely on an element of the Bloch group. The main theorems of this paper concern number fields, their algebraic $K$-theory and its regulator maps (Borel, $p$-adic and \'etale), whereas the explicit collections of series are defined by a careful algebraic analysis of the infinite Pochhammer symbol at roots of unity. The origin of the above mentioned power series comes from perturbative Chern--Simons theory and by expansions of the admissible series of Kontsevich--Soibelman, both ultimately related to the infinite Pochhammer symbol. This link suggests that some Donaldson-Thomas invariants have arithmetic meaning and that some elements of the Habiro ring of a number field have enumerative meaning.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using the ratios theorems, we calculate the leading order terms in $N$ for the following averages of the characteristic polynomial and its derivative: $\left< \left|\Lambda_A(1 )\right| ^{r} \frac{ \Lambda_A'(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi}) }{ \Lambda_A(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi})} \right>_{SO(2N)}$ and $\left< \left|\Lambda_A(1 )\right| ^{r} \frac{ \Lambda_A'(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi}) }{ \Lambda_A(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi})} \right>_{USp(2N)}$. Our expression, derived for integer $r$, permits analytic continuation in $r$ and we conjecture that this agrees with the above averages for non-integer exponents. We use this result to obtain an expression for the one level density of the `excised ensemble', a subensemble of $SO(2N)$, to next-to-leading order in $N$. We then present the analogous calculation for the one level density of quadratic twists of elliptic curve $L$-functions, taking into account a number theoretical bound on the central values of the $L$-functions. The method we use to calculate the above random matrix averages uses the contour integral form of the ratios theorems, which are a key tool in the growing literature on averages of characteristic polynomials and their derivatives, and as we evaluate the next-to-leading term for large matrix size $N$, this leads to some multi-dimensional contour integrals that are slightly asymmetric in the integration variables, which might be useful in other work.</p></details>

The concept of good integers has been the subject of continuous investigation since the 1990s due to their elegant number-theoretic properties and their significant applications in various areas, particularly in coding theory. This paper provides a comprehensive review of good integers, emphasizing both their theoretical foundations and their practical implications. We first revisit the fundamental number-theoretic properties of good integers and present their characterizations in a systematic manner. The exposition is enriched with well-structured algorithms and illustrative diagrams that facilitate their computation and classification. Subsequently, we explore applications of good integers in the study of algebraic coding theory. In particular, their roles in the characterization, construction, and enumeration of self-dual cyclic codes and complementary dual cyclic codes are discussed in detail. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the theory. This review not only consolidates existing results but also highlights the unifying role of good integers in bridging number theory and coding theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce limit categories for cotangent stacks of smooth stacks as an effective version of classical limits of categories of D-modules on them. We develop their general theory and pursue their relation with categories of D-modules. In particular, we establish the functorial properties of limit categories such as the smooth pull-back and projective push-forward. Using the notion of limit categories, we propose a precise formulation of the Dolbeault geometric Langlands conjecture, proposed by Donagi-Pantev as the classical limit of the de Rham geometric Langlands equivalence. It states an equivalence between the derived categories of moduli stacks of semistable Higgs bundles and limit categories of moduli stacks of all Higgs bundles. We prove the existence of a semiorthogonal decomposition of the limit category into quasi-BPS categories, which are categorical versions of BPS invariants on a non-compact Calabi-Yau 3-fold. This semiorthogonal decomposition is interpreted as a Langlands dual to the semiorthogonal decomposition constructed in our previous work on the category of coherent sheaves on the moduli stack of semistable Higgs bundles. We also construct Hecke operators on limit categories for Higgs bundles. They are expected to be compatible with Wilson operators under our formulation of Dolbeault geometric Langlands conjecture. The conjectured equivalence implies an equivalence between BPS categories for semistable Higgs bundles, which we expect to be a categorical version of the topological mirror symmetry conjecture for Higgs bundles by Hausel-Thaddeus.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present an algorithm to determine the Galois group of an irreducible monic polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ of degree at most five. Following work of Conrad, Dummit, and Stauduhar this comes down to answering two questions: Is a given integer a square? and Does a given polynomial have an integral root? Since these are both easily addressed with a calculator, our algorithm amounts to Galois theory by calculator. For example, we have an implementation at Desmos.com. In an appendix we present a simplified version of our algorithm, suitable for a handheld calculator, in case $f(x) = x^n + px + q$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent work with Raum the authors considered congruences for the ordinary partition function $p(n)$ of the form $p(\ell Q^r n+\beta)\equiv 0\pmod\ell$ where $\ell, Q\geq 5$ are prime and $r\in \{1,2\}$, and proved a number of results which show that such congruences are scarce in a precise sense. Here we improve one of our results when $r=1$; in particular we prove (outside of trivial cases) that the set of primes $Q$ such that there exists $\beta\in \mathbb{Z}$ with $p(\ell Q n+\beta)\equiv 0\pmod \ell$ for all $n$ has density zero. The proof involves a modification of part of our previous argument and an application of a recent theorem of Dicks regarding modular forms of half-integral weight and level one modulo $\ell$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a regular normal element in an arbitrary ring, we study the category of its module factorizations. The cokernel functor relates module factorizations with Gorenstein projective components to Gorenstein projective modules over the quotient ring. The results are vast extensions of Eisenbud's matrix factorization theorem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a general and effective algebraic framework for enumerating finite-length quotients of a torsion-free sheaf of arbitrary rank (the Quot zeta function) and finite-length coherent sheaves (the Coh zeta function) over reduced singular curves. We show that the Coh zeta function can be recovered as a transparent high-rank limit of Quot zeta functions. We prove that Quot zeta functions are motivically rational, using a novel parametrization and the geometry of affine Grassmannians, and that they satisfy an arbitrary-rank reflection principle, via harmonic analysis. As a first application, we compute explicit formulas for these zeta functions for all $y^2 = x^n$ singularities, revealing a surprising and previously unknown connection to Rogers--Ramanujan type $q$-series. Further applications to the enumerative geometry of affine Springer fibers and commuting varieties are also discussed.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\tilde{\Sigma}$ be the universal cover of a closed surface $\Sigma$ of genus at least $2$. We characterize all equivariantly area-minimizing maps from $\tilde{\Sigma}$ to a Hilbert sphere, which are equivariant with respect to an isometric action of $\pi_1(\Sigma)$ weakly equivalent to the regular representation. As part of our proof, we classify all minimal surfaces in Hilbert spheres with constant negative Gaussian curvature. This builds on earlier results of E. Calabi, K. Kenmotsu, R. Bryant.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $r \geq 0$, and let $\lambda$ and $\mu$ be partitions such that $\lambda_1 \leq r + 1$. We present a combinatorial interpretation of the plethysm coefficient $\langle s_\lambda, s_\mu[s_r] \rangle$. As a consequence, we solve the restriction problem for partitions with at most three columns. That is, for all partitions $\lambda$ with $\lambda_1 \leq 3$, we find a combinatorial interpretation for the multiplicities of the irreducible $\mathfrak{S}_n$-submodules of the Schur module $\mathbb{S}^\lambda \mathbb{C}^n$, considered as an $\mathfrak{S}_n$-module.</p></details>
