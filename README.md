<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given any vertex operator algebra $ V $ with an automorphism $ g $, we derive a Jacobi identity for an intertwining operator $ \mathcal{Y} $ of type $ \left( \begin{smallmatrix} W_3\\ W_1 \, W_2 \end{smallmatrix}\right) $ when $ W_1 $ is an untwisted $ V $-module, and $ W_2 $ and $ W_3 $ are $ g $-twisted $ V $-modules. We say such an intertwining operator is of $\left(\!\begin{smallmatrix} g\\ 1 \ g \end{smallmatrix}\!\right)$-type. Using the Jacobi identity, we obtain homogeneous linear differential equations satisfied by the multi-series $ \langle w_0, \mathcal{Y}_1(w_1,z_1) \cdots \mathcal{Y}_N(w_N,z_N) w_{N+1} \rangle $ when $ \mathcal{Y}_j $ are of $\left(\!\begin{smallmatrix} g\\ 1 \ g \end{smallmatrix}\!\right)$-type and the modules are $ C_1 $-cofinite and discretely graded. In the special case that $ V $ is an affine vertex operator algebra, we derive the ``twisted KZ equations" and show that its solutions have regular singularities at certain prescribed points when $ g $ has finite order. When $ V $ is general and $ g $ has finite order, we use the theory of regular singular points to prove that the multi-series $ \langle w_0, \mathcal{Y}_1(w_1,z_1) \cdots \mathcal{Y}_N(w_N,z_N) w_{N+1} \rangle $ converges absolutely to a multivalued analytic function when $ |z_1| > \cdots > |z_N| > 0 $ and analytically extends to the region $ z_i, z_i - z_j \neq 0 $. Furthermore, when $ N = 2 $, we show that these multivalued functions have regular singularities at certain prescribed points.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-03 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Marc T. Pudelko &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 10 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Classical studies of the Fibonacci sequence focus on its periodicity modulo $m$ (the Pisano periods) with canonical initialization. We investigate instead the complete periodic structure arising from all $m^2$ possible initializations in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. We discover perfect chiral symmetry between the Fibonacci recurrence $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and its parity transform $a_n = - a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and observe fractal self-similarity in the extension from prime to prime power moduli. Additionally, we classify prime moduli based on their quadratic reciprocity and demonstrate that periodic sequences exhibit weight preservation under modular extension. Furthermore, we define a minima distribution $P(n)$ governed by Lucas ratios, which satisfies the symmetric relation $P(n)=P(1-n)$. For cyclotomic recurrences, we propose explicit counting functions for the number of distinct periods with connections to necklace enumeration. These findings imply potential connections to Viswanath's random recurrence, modular forms and L-functions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Added Corollaries 3.30 and 3.33 Corrected Corollary 1.3, addition of a self-duality condition

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a $p$-adic field. In this article, we consider representations of split special orthogonal groups $\mathrm{SO}_{2n+1}(F)$ and symplectic groups $\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(F)$ of rank $n$. We denote by $\pi_1 \times \ldots \times \pi_r \rtimes \pi$ the normalized parabolically induced representation of either. Now let $u_i$ be essentially Speh representations and $\pi$ a representation of Arthur type. We prove that the parabolic induction $u_1 \times \ldots \times u_r \rtimes \pi$ is irreducible if and only if $u_i \times u_j$, $u_i \times u_j^\vee$ and $u_i \rtimes \pi$ are irreducible for all choices of $i\neq j$. If $u_i$ are Speh representations, we determine the composition series of the above parabolically induced representation. Through this, we are able to produce a new collection of unitary representations.</p></details>

Our purpose is to show that modifications of Ap\'ery's continued fractions can give interesting results including new rapidly convergent continued fractions for certain interesting constants.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is well-known that ADE Dynkin diagrams classify both the simply-laced simple Lie algebras and simple singularities. We introduce a polygonal wheel in a plane for each case of ADE, called the Coxeter wheel. We show that equivalence classes of edges and spokes of a Coxeter wheel form a geometric root system isomorphic to the classical root system of the corresponding type. This wheel is in fact derived from the Milnor fiber of corresponding simple singularities of two variables, and the bilinear form on the geometric root system is the negative of its symmetrized Seifert form. Furthermore, we give a completely geometric definition of simple Lie algebras using arcs, Seifert form and variation operator of the singularity theory.</p></details>

Let $\mathcal{N}_K$ be the set of positive integers $n$ such that there exist units $\varepsilon, \delta \in \mathcal{O}_K^\times$ satisfying $\varepsilon + \delta = n$. We show that $\mathcal{N}_K$ is a finite set if $K$ does not contain any real quadratic subfield. In the case where $K$ is a cubic field, we also explicitly classify all solutions to the unit equation $\varepsilon + \delta = n$ when $K$ is either cyclic or has negative discriminant.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: 45 pages; 1 appendix by Forey, Fres\'an and Kowalski; dedicated to the memory of G. Laumon

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We survey some of the stratification theorems concerning exponential sums over finite fields, especially those due to Katz-Laumon and Fouvry-Katz, as well as some of their applications. Moreover, motivated partly by recent work of Bonolis, Pierce and Woo (arXiv:2505.11226), we prove that these stratification statements admit uniform variants in families, both algebraically and analytically. The paper includes an Appendix by Forey, Fres\'an and Kowalski (excerpted from arXiv:2109.11961), which provides an elementary intuitive introduction to trace functions in more than one variable over finite fields.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 60 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\Gamma < G$ be an arithmetic lattice in a noncompact connected semisimple real algebraic group. For many such $G$ of rank at most $2$, in particular $G = \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb R)$, we prove effective equidistribution of large translates of tori in $G/\Gamma$. As an application, we obtain an asymptotic counting formula with a power saving error term for integral $3 \times 3$ matrices with a specified characteristic polynomial. These effectivize celebrated theorems of Eskin-Mozes-Shah.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Accepted version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Plumbing spaces have drawn significant attention among symplectic topologists due to their natural occurrence as examples of Weinstein manifolds. In our paper, we provide a general formula for the wrapped Fukaya category of plumbings (with arbitrary grading structure) of cotangent bundles along any quiver. Our approach relies on "local-to-global" computations. Specifically, we compute the wrapped Fukaya category of "plumbing sectors" that serve as local models for the singularities of Lagrangian skeletons of plumbing spaces. As corollaries, we fully describe the wrapped Fukaya category of plumbing spaces in dimension $4$ and plumbings of $T^*S^n$ for $n \geq 3$. We show that any Ginzburg dg algebra/category of a graded quiver without potential is equivalent to the wrapped Fukaya category of a plumbing of $T^*S^n$ (with the corresponding grading structure).</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-03 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Guy Fowler &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 32 pages, to appear in Math. Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an Andr\'e--Oort-type result for a family of hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^n$ that is both uniform and effective. Let $K_*$ denote the single exceptional imaginary quadratic field which occurs in the Siegel--Tatuzawa lower bound for the class number. We prove that, for $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, there exists an effective constant $c(m, n)>0$ with the following property: if pairwise distinct singular moduli $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ with respective discriminants $\Delta_1, \ldots, \Delta_n$ are such that $a_1 x_1^m + \ldots + a_n x_n^m \in \mathbb{Q}$ for some $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in \mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0\}$ and $\# \{ \Delta_i : \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta_i}) = K_*\} \leq 1$, then $\max_i \lvert \Delta_i \rvert \leq c(m, n)$. In addition, we prove an unconditional and completely explicit version of this result when $(m, n) = (1, 3)$ and thereby determine all the triples $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ of singular moduli such that $a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 \in \mathbb{Q}$ for some $a_1, a_2, a_3 \in \mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0\}$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-03 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Thomas Dreyfus, Tanguy Rivoal &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fres\'an and Jossen have given a negative answer to a question of Siegel about the representability of every $E$-function as a polynomial with algebraic coefficients in $E$-functions of type ${}_pF_q[\underline{a};\underline{b};\gamma x^{q-p+1}]$ with $q\geq p\geq 0$, $\gamma \in \overline{\mathbb Q}$ and rational parameters $\underline{a}, \underline{b}$. In this paper, we study, in a more general context, a similar question for $G$-functions asked by Fischler and the second author: can every $G$-function be represented as a polynomial with algebraic coefficients in $G$-functions of type $\mu(x)\cdot {}_pF_{p-1}[\underline{a};\underline{b};\lambda(x)]$ with $p\ge 1$, rational parameters $\underline{a},\underline{b}$ and $\mu,\lambda$ algebraic over $\mathbb Q(x)$ with $\lambda(0)=0$? They have shown the answer to be negative under a generalization of Grothendieck's Period Conjecture and a technical assumption on the~$\lambda$'s. Using differential Galois theory, we prove that, for every $N\in \mathbb N$, there exists a $G$-function which can not be represented as a rational function with coefficients in $\overline{\mathbb C(x)}$ of solutions of linear differential equations with coefficients in $\mathbb C(x)$ and at most $N$ singularities in $\mathbb{P}^1 (\mathbb C)$. As a corollary, we deduce that not all $G$-functions can be represented as a rational function in hypergeometric series of the above mentioned type, when the $\lambda$'s are rational functions with degrees of their numerators and denominators bounded by an arbitrarily large fixed constant. This provides an unconditional negative answer to the question asked by Fischler and the second author for such~$\lambda$'s.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 78 pages. Corrected a mistake in Lemma 6.17 of the previous version and in Section 8

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We explore an analogy between, on one hand, the notions of integral closure of ideals and Rees valuations in commutative algebra and, on the other hand, the notions of spectral seminorm and Shilov boundary in nonarchimedean geometry. For any Tate ring $\mathcal{A}$ with a Noetherian ring of definition $\mathcal{A}_{0}$ and pseudo-uniformizer $\varpi\in\mathcal{A}_{0}$, we prove that the Shilov boundary for $\mathcal{A}$ naturally coincides with the set of Rees valuation rings of the principal ideal $(\varpi)_{\mathcal{A}_{0}}$ of $\mathcal{A}_{0}$. Furthermore, we characterize the Shilov boundary for a wide class of Tate rings by means of minimal open prime ideals in the subring of power-bounded elements. For affinoid algebras, in the sense of Tate, whose underlying rings are integral domains, this recovers a well-known result of Berkovich. Moreover, under some mild assumptions, we prove stability of our characterization of the Shilov boundary under (completed) integral extensions. In particular, for every mixed-characteristic Noetherian domain $R$, we obtain a description of the Shilov boundary for the Tate ring $\widehat{R^{+}}[p^{-1}]$, where $\widehat{R^{+}}$ is the $p$-adic completion of the absolute integral closure of the domain $R$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 40 pages, 1 figure; comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a general construction of eventually periodic projective resolutions for modules over quotients of rings of finite left global dimension by a regular central element. Our approach utilizes a construction of Shamash, combined with the iterated mapping cone technique, to systematically 'purge' homology from a complex. The construction is applied specifically to the integral group rings of groups with finite virtual cohomological dimension. We demonstrate the computability of our method through explicit calculations for several families of groups including hyperbolic triangle groups and mapping class groups of the punctured plane.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Ben Sa\"id--Kobayashi--{\O}rsted introduced a family of $ \mathfrak{sl}_2 $-triples of differential-difference operators $ \mathbb{H}_{k, a} $, $ \mathbb{E}^+_{k, a} $ and $ \mathbb{E}^-_{k, a} $ on $ \mathbb{R}^N \setminus \{0\} $ indexed by a Dunkl parameter $ k $ and a deformation parameter $ a \neq 0 $. In the present paper, we study the behavior as the parameter $ a $ approaches $ 0 $. In this limit, the Lie algebra $ \mathfrak{g}_{k, a} = \mathrm{span}_{\mathbb{R}} \{\mathbb{H}_{k, a}, \mathbb{E}^+_{k, a}, \mathbb{E}^-_{k, a}\} \cong \mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R}) $ contracts to a three-dimensional commutative Lie algebra $ \mathfrak{g}_{k, 0} $, and its spectral properties change. We describe the joint spectral decomposition for $ \mathfrak{g}_{k, 0} $, and discuss formulas for operator semigroups with infinitesimal generators in $ \mathfrak{g}_{k, 0} $. In particular, we describe the integral kernel of $ \exp(z \lvert x \rvert^2 \Delta_k) $ as an infinite series, which, in some low-dimensional cases, can be expressed in a closed form using the theta function.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 8 pages, no figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We revisit the effective Erdos-Wintner theorem for Zeckendorf expansions. Drmota and the author obtained a uniform Kolmogorov bound whose error involves $T\sum_{j>L-2h}|f(F_j)|$, which assumes absolute convergence of the linear tail $\sum_j f(F_j)$. We remove this assumption. Grouping the transfer matrices in pairs and working to second order on the logarithm of the product, after extracting the common linear phase along the dominant direction, yields a quadratic tail $T^2\sum_{j>L-2h} f(F_j)^2$, or, in a flexible variant, the split tail $T\sum_{|f(F_j)|>1/T}|f(F_j)| + T^2\sum_{|f(F_j)|\le 1/T} f(F_j)^2$. Either form requires only $\sum f(F_j)^2<\infty$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Together with David Schlang we computed the discriminants of the invariant Hermitian forms for all indicator $o$ even degree absolutely irreducible characters of the ATLAS groups supplementing the tables of orthogonal determinants computed in collaboration with Richard Parker, Tobias Braun and Thomas Breuer. The methods that are used in the unitary case are described in this paper. A character has a well defined unitary discriminant, if and only if it is unitary stable, i.e. all irreducible unitary constituents have even degree. Computations for large degree characters are only possible because of a new method called {\em unitary condensation}. A suitable automorphism helps to single out a square class of the real subfield of the character field consisting of representatives of the discriminant of the invariant Hermitian forms. This square class can then be determined modulo enough primes.</p></details>

As an application of this construction, we derive a generating function of solutions of the TBA equation in the unrefined case.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 37 pages, Section 2 and related references are deleted because we do not need them for the proof, abstract modified, some typos corrected

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a global field, $K/k$ be a finite separable field extension and $L/k$ be the Galois closure of $K/k$ with Galois groups $G={\rm Gal}(L/k)$ and $H={\rm Gal}(L/K)\lneq G$. In 1931, Hasse proved that if $G$ is cyclic, then the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. We show that if $G$ is metacyclic with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$, then $H$ is cyclic and the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. Some examples of metacyclic, dihedral, quasidihedral, modular, generalized quaternion, extraspecial groups and $Z$-groups $G$ with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$ are given. These provide new examples which the Hasse norm principle hold for non-Galois extensions $K/k$ whose Galois closure is $L/k$ with metacyclic $G={\rm Gal}(L/k)$ and $M(G)=0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Every LCA group has a Haar measure unique up to rescaling by a positive scalar. Clausen has shown that the Haar measure describes the universal determinant functor of the category LCA in the sense of Deligne. We show that when only working with LCA groups without allowing real vector spaces, any conceivable determinant functor is unique up to rescaling by at worst rational values. As a result, no transcendental real nor p-adic regulators could ever show up in special L-value conjectures (as in Tamagawa number conjectures or Weil-etale cohomology) if anyone had the, admittedly outlandish and bizarre, idea to try to circumvent incorporating a real (Betti) realization of the motive.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Major updates: (1) a general formula for computing interval multiplicity (resp. rank) invariants of persistence modules under any (resp. rank) compression system $\xi$; (2) clearer definition of essential covers (relative to $\xi$); (3) added GitHub link for interval rank invariant and replacement computations (under tot and ss); (4) fixed typos and refined notions

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define two notions. The first one is a $rank\ compression\ system$ $\xi$ for a finite poset $\mathbf{P}$ that assigns each interval subposet $I$ to an order-preserving map $\xi_I \colon I^{\xi} \to \mathbf{P}$ satisfying some conditions, where $I^{\xi}$ is a connected finite poset. An example is given by the $total$ compression system that assigns each $I$ to the inclusion of $I$ into $\mathbf{P}$. The second one is an $I$-$rank$ of a persistence module $M$ under $\xi$, the family of which is called the $interval\ rank\ invariant$ of $M$ under $\xi$. A compression system $\xi$ makes it possible to define the $interval\ replacement$ (also called the interval-decomposable approximation) not only for 2D persistence modules but also for any persistence modules over any finite poset. We will show that the forming of the interval replacement preserves the interval rank invariant, which is a stronger property than the preservation of the usual rank invariant. Moreover, to know what is preserved by the replacement explicitly, we will give a formula of the $I$-rank of $M$ under $\xi$ in terms of the structure linear maps of $M$ for any compression system $\xi$. The formula leads us to a concept of essential cover, which gives us a sufficient condition for the $I$-rank of $M$ under $\xi$ to coincide with that under another compression system $\zeta$. This is applied to the case where $\xi = \mathrm{tot}$, the value of $I$-rank under which is equal to the generalized rank invariant introduced by Kim--M{\'e}moli, to give an alternative proof of their theorem computing the generalized rank invariant by using a zigzag path.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Intrinsic volumes are fundamental geometric invariants generalizing volume, surface area, and mean width for convex bodies. We establish a unified Laplace-Grassmannian representation for intrinsic and dual volumes of convex polynomial sublevel sets. More precisely, let $f$ be a convex $d$-homogeneous polynomial of even degree $d \ge 2$ which is positive except at the origin. We show that the intrinsic and dual volumes of the sublevel set $[f \le 1]$ admit Laplace-type integral formulas obtained by averaging the infimal projection and restriction of $f$ over the Grassmannian. This explicit representation yields three main consequences: (1) L\"owner--John-type existence and uniqueness results extending beyond the classical volume case; (2) a block decomposition principle describing factorization of intrinsic volumes under direct-sum splitting; (3) a coordinate-free formulation of Lipschitz-type lattice discrepancy bounds. These formulas enable analytic treatment of a broad class of geometric quantities, providing direct access to variational and arithmetic applications as well as new structural insights.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent paper with Sahi and Stokman, we introduced quasi-polynomial generalizations of Macdonald polynomials for arbitrary root systems via a new class of representations of the double affine Hecke algebra. These objects depend on a deformation parameter $q$, Hecke parameters, and an additional torus parameter. In this paper, we study $\textit{antisymmetric}$ and $\textit{symmetric}$ quasi-polynomial analogs of Macdonald polynomials in the $q \rightarrow \infty$ limit. We provide explicit decomposition formulas for these objects in terms of classical Demazure-Lusztig operators and partial symmetrizers, and relate them to Macdonald polynomials with prescribed symmetry in the same limit. We also provide a complete characterization of (anti-)symmetric quasi-polynomials in terms of partially (anti-)symmetric polynomials. As an application, we obtain formulas for metaplectic spherical Whittaker functions associated to arbitrary root systems. For $GL_{r}$, this recovers some recent results of Brubaker, Buciumas, Bump, and Gustafsson, and proves a precise statement of their conjecture about a "parahoric-metaplectic" duality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the Skolem Problem is decidable in finitely generated commutative rings of positive characteristic. More precisely, we show that there exists an algorithm which, given a finite presentation of a (unitary) commutative ring $\mathcal{R} = \mathbb{Z}_{/T}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]/I$ of characteristic $T > 0$, and a linear recurrence sequence $(\gamma_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in \mathcal{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$, determines whether $(\gamma_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ contains a zero term. Our proof is based on two recent results: Dong and Shafrir (2025) on the solution set of S-unit equations over $p^e$-torsion modules, and Karimov, Luca, Nieuwveld, Ouaknine, and Worrell (2025) on solving linear equations over powers of two multiplicatively independent numbers. Our result implies, moreover, that the zero set of a linear recurrence sequence over a ring of characteristic $T = p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is effectively a finite union of $p_i$-normal sets in the sense of Derksen (2007).</p></details>

Namely, we prove that for every such $k$, every measure-preserving system $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu,T)$ and every $f\in L^{\infty}_{\mu}(X)$, we have that $$ \lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^Nf(T^{n\lfloor n\sqrt{k}\rfloor}x)\quad\text{exists for $\mu$-a.e. $x\in X$.} $$ Notably, our analysis involves a curious implementation of the circle method developed for analyzing exponential sums with phases $(\xi n \lfloor n\sqrt{k}\rfloor)_{1\le n\le N}$ exhibiting arithmetical obstructions beyond rationals with small denominators, and is based on the Green and Tao's result on the quantitative behaviour of polynomial orbits on nilmanifolds. For the case $k=2$ such a circle method was firstly employed for addressing the corresponding Waring-type problem by Neale, and their work constitutes the departure point of our considerations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We initiate the mathematical study of the boundary Carrollian conformal algebra (BCCA), an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra recently discovered in the context of Carrollian physics. The BCCA is an intriguing object from both physical and mathematical perspectives, since it is a filtered but not graded Lie algebra. In this paper, we first construct some modules for the BCCA and one of its subalgebras, which we call $\mathcal{O}$, by restriction of well-known modules of the BMS$_3$ and Witt algebras respectively. Along the way, we prove the irreducibility criteria for the so-called ``induced modules'' of the BMS$_3$ algebra (which we prefer to call massive modules to avoid ambiguity) and show that this is the same criteria for the irreducibility of the Verma modules of the BMS$_3$ algebra. Interestingly, the modules generated by the action of the BCCA on the generating vector of the massive modules are also irreducible under the same criteria. When this criteria holds, every massive module decomposes into a direct sum of two BCCA-submodules, each of which we conjecture to be irreducible. Meanwhile, restricting Verma modules to the BCCA and $\mathcal{O}$ leads to free or ``almost free'' modules, which are not particularly interesting from a representation-theoretic viewpoint. This motivates the construction of BCCA modules intrinsically. To do this, we go through some structure theory on the BCCA to define a new basis and a decreasing filtration on the algebra, using which we construct Whittaker modules over the BCCA and the subalgebra $\mathcal{O}$ and prove criteria for their irreducibility.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any prime $p$ and real number and $\alpha$, the $p$-adic Littlewood Conjecture due to de Mathan and Teuli\'e asserts that $$\inf_{|m|\ge1}|m|_p\cdot |m|\cdot |\left\langle\alpha m\right\rangle|=0.$$ Above, $|m|$ is the usual absolute value, $|m|_p$ is the $p$-adic norm and $\left|\left\langle x\right\rangle\right|$ is the distance from $x\in\mathbb{R}$ to the nearest integer. Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field and $P(t)\in\mathbb{K}[t]$ be an irreducible polynomial. This paper deals with the analogue of this conjecture over the field of formal Laurent series over $\mathbb{K}$, known as the $P(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture ($P(t)$-LC). The following results are established: (1) Any counterexample to $P(t)$-LC for the case $P(t)=t$ generates a counterexample when $P(t)$ is any irreducible polynomial. Since $P(t)$-LC is knwon to be false when $P(t)=t$ and $\mathbb{K}$ has characteristic 0,3,5,7 and 11, one obtains a disproof of the $P(t)$-LC over any such field for any choice of irreducible polynomial $P(t)$. (2) A Khintchine-type theorem for $t$-adic multiplicative approximation is established, enabling one to determine the measure of the set of counterexamples to $P(t)$-LC with an additional monotonic growth function in the case $P(t)=t$. (3) The Hausdorff dimension of the same set is shown to be maximal when $P(t)=t$ in the critical case where the growth function is $\log^2$. These goals are achieved by developing an extensive theory in combinatorics relating $P(t)$-LC to the properties of the so-called number wall of a sequence. This is an infinite array containing the determinant of every finite Toeplitz matrix generated by that sequence. The main novelty of this paper is creating a dictionary allowing one to transfer statements in Diophantine approximation in positive characteristic to combinatorics through the concept of a number wall, and conversely.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete subgroup of a unimodular locally compact group $G$. In Math. Ann. 388, 4251-4305 (2024), it was shown that the $L_p$ norm of a Fourier multiplier $m$ on $\Gamma$ can be bounded locally by its $L_p$-norm on $G$, modulo a constant $c(A)$ which depends on the support $A$ of $m$. In the context where $G$ is a connected Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, we develop tools to find explicit bounds on $c(A)$. We show that the problem reduces to: 1) The adjoint representation of the semisimple quotient $\mathfrak{s} = \mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{r}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ by the radical $\mathfrak{r}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ (which was handled in the paper mentioned above). 2) The action of $\mathfrak{s}$ on a set of real irreducible representations that arise from quotients of the commutator series of $\mathfrak{r}$. In particular, we show that $c(G) = 1$ for unimodular connected solvable Lie groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the coherent cohomology of automorphic sheaves corresponding to Siegel modular forms $f$ of low weight on ${\rm GSp}(4)$ Shimura varieties. Inspired by the work of Prasanna--Venkatesh on singular cohomology of locally symmetric spaces, we propose a conjecture that explains all the contributions of a Hecke eigensystem to coherent cohomology in terms of the action of a motivic cohomology group. Under some technical conditions, we prove that our conjecture is equivalent to Beilinson's conjecture for the adjoint $L$-function of $f$. We also prove some unconditional results in special cases. For a lift $f$ of a Hilbert modular form $f_0$ to ${\rm GSp}(4)$, we produce elements in the motivic cohomology group for which the conjecture holds, using the results of Ramakrishnan on the Asai $L$-function of $f_0$. For a lift $f$ of a Bianchi modular form $f_0$ to ${\rm GSp}(4)$, we show that our conjecture for $f$ is equivalent to the conjecture of Prasanna-Venkatesh for $f_0$, thus establishing a connection between the motivic action conjectures for locally symmetric spaces of non-hermitian type and those for coherent cohomology of Shimura varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal A$ be a hyperplane arrangement in a vector space $V$ and $G \leq GL(V)$ a group fixing $\mathcal A$. In case when $G$ is a complex reflection group and $\mathcal A=\mathcal A(G)$ is its reflection arrangement in $V$, Douglass, Pfeiffer, and R\"ohrle studied the invariants of the $Q G$-module $H^*(M(\mathcal A);Q)$, the rational, singular cohomology of the complement space $M(\mathcal A)$ in $V$. In this paper we generalize the work in Douglass, Pfeiffer, and R\"ohrle to the case of quaternionic reflection groups. We obtain a straightforward generalization of the Hilbert--Poincar\'e series of the ring of invariants in the cohomology from the complex case when the quaternionic reflection group is complex-reducible according to Cohen's classification. Surprisingly, only one additional family of new types of Poincar\'e polynomials occurs in the quaternionic setting which is not realised in the complex case, namely those of a particular class of imprimitive irreducible quaternionic reflection groups. Finally, we discuss bases of the space of $G$-invariants in $H^*(M(\mathcal A);Q)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Polynomial optimization problems often arise in sequences indexed by dimension, and it is of interest to compute bounds on the optimal values of all problems in the sequence. Examples include certifying inequalities between symmetric functions or graph homomorphism densities that hold over vectors and graphs of all sizes, and computing the value of mean-field games viewed as limits of games with a growing number of players. In this paper, we study such any-dimensional polynomial problems using the theory of representation stability, and we develop a systematic framework to produce hierarchies of bounds for their limiting optimal values in terms of finite-dimensional polynomial optimization problems. In this paper, we study such any-dimensional polynomial problems using the theory of representation stability, and we develop a systematic framework to produce sequences of improving bounds on their limiting optimal values. Our bounds are obtained by solving finite-dimensional polynomial optimization problems (or their relaxations). These bounds converge at explicit rates, and they follow as a consequence of new de Finetti-type theorems pertaining to sequences of random arrays projecting onto each other in different ways. The proofs of these theorems are based on applying results from probability to representations of certain categories. We apply our framework to produce new bounds on problems arising in a number of application domains such as mean-field games, extremal graph theory, and symmetric function theory, and we illustrate our methods via numerical experiments.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates Srinivasa Ramanujan's initial intuitive methodology for assigning the finite value -1/12 to the sum of the divergent infinite series of all positive integers. We systematically examine Ramanujan's initial method, originally sketched in his notebooks, and set the methodology into an algebraic framework. The methodology has limited applicability to other classes of divergent series. The methodology is extended to assign a Ramanujan smoothed sum to the infinite sequences of integers raised to a positive integer power and to figurate binomial number sequences, including triangular numbers, tetrahedral numbers, and higher-dimensional analogues, avoiding analytical continuation. A key finding establishes that the Ramanujan smoothed sums of figurate binomial sequences are intrinsically connected to logarithmic numbers (Gregory coefficients), providing a novel perspective on Ramanujan summation through the lens of classical combinatorial functions. The paper applies asymptotic expansions of associated rational generating functions to demonstrate consistency with established results from analytic continuation methods. The results illuminate the deeper mathematical structures underlying Ramanujan's intuitive insights and suggest new avenues for research in divergent series summation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that all projective crepant resolutions of Nakajima quiver varieties satisfying natural conditions are also Nakajima quiver varieties. More generally, we classify the small birational models of many Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) quotients by introducing a sufficient condition for the GIT quotient of an affine variety $V$ by the action of a reductive group $G$ to be a relative Mori Dream Space. Two surprising examples illustrate that our new condition is optimal. When the condition holds, we show that the linearisation map identifies a region of the GIT fan with the Mori chamber decomposition of the relative movable cone of $V /\!/_{\theta} G$. If $V/\!/_{\theta} G$ is a crepant resolution of $Y\!\!:= V/\!/_{0} G$, then every projective crepant resolution of $Y$ is obtained by varying $\theta$. Under suitable conditions, we show that this is the case for quiver varieties and hypertoric varieties. Similarly, for any finite subgroup $\Gamma\subset \mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})$ whose nontrivial conjugacy classes are all junior, we obtain a simple geometric proof of the fact that every projective crepant resolution of $\mathbb{C}^3/\Gamma$ is a fine moduli space of $\theta$-stable $\Gamma$-constellations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present several elementary closed-forms that express a non-trivial divisor for every composite integer $n > 1$. Each closed-form consists of a fixed number of elementary arithmetic operations drawn from the set: addition, subtraction, multiplication, integer division, and exponentiation. Two families of closed-forms are developed. First, direct application of the hypercube method yields closed-forms $T_1(n)$, $T_2(n)$, $T_3(n)$, and $T_4(n)$ expressing the smallest prime divisor, largest non-trivial divisor, largest prime divisor, and greatest prime $\leq n$, respectively. The factorial-unwinding technique underlying these hypercube constructions leads to extreme symbolic complexity, motivating our main result: An alternative closed-form $T(n)$ that avoids factorial-unwinding by synthesizing the quadratic residue invariants $\chi(n)$ (largest $r$ such that $r^2$ is a divisor) and $\omega(n)$ (number of distinct prime divisors) with integer root extraction. Although evaluating these closed-forms requires exponential time, the number of arithmetic operations performed remains constant and independent of the input size $n$. This sharply contrasts with traditional algorithmic methods, where the number of operations required to locate a non-trivial divisor necessarily scales with $n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical fiber product in algebraic geometry provides a powerful tool for studying loci where two morphisms to a base scheme, $\phi: X \to S$ and $\psi: Y \to S$, coincide exactly. This condition of strict equality, however, is insufficient for describing many real-world applications. This paper develops a new framework to study and quantify the nature of approximate alignment between morphisms in the context of arithmetic geometry, using the tools of {\'e}tale homotopy theory. We introduce the central object of our work, the \textit{{\'e}tale mismatch torsor}, a sheaf of torsors over the product scheme $X \times_S Y$. The structure of this sheaf serves as a rich, intrinsic, and purely algebraic object amenable to both qualitative classification and quantitative analysis of the global relationship between the two morphisms. Our main results are twofold. First, we provide a complete classification of these structures, establishing a bijection between their isomorphism classes and the first {\'e}tale cohomology group $H_{\text{\'e}t}^1(X \times_S Y, \underline{\pi_1^{\text{\'e}t}(S)})$. Second, we construct a canonical filtration on this classifying cohomology group based on the theory of infinitesimal neighborhoods. This filtration induces a new invariant, which we term the \textit{order of mismatch}, providing a hierarchical, algebraic measure for the degree of approximation between the morphisms. We apply this framework to the concrete case of generalized Howe curves over finite fields, demonstrating how both the characteristic class and its order reveal subtle arithmetic properties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By recent work of the author, Wilson's theorem as well as the Wilson quotient can be described by supercongruences of power sums of Fermat quotients modulo every higher prime power. We translate these congruences into congruences of power sums and Bernoulli numbers. This together provides relatively short proofs of the congruences compared to former approaches. As an application, we compute, e.g., the Wilson quotient up to modulo $p^4$ and equivalently the factorial $(p-1)!$ up to modulo $p^5$, which can be extended to any higher prime power with some effort. As a by-product, we determine some power sums of the Fermat quotients up to modulo $p^4$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, we showed that global root numbers of modular forms are biased toward +1. Together with Pharis, we also showed an initial bias of Fourier coefficients towards the sign of the root number. First, we prove analogous results with respect to local root numbers. Second, a subtle correlation between Fourier coefficients and global root numbers, termed murmurations, was recently discovered for elliptic curves and modular forms. We conjecture murmurations in a more general context of different (possibly empty) combinations of local root numbers. Last, an appendix corrects a sign error in our joint paper with Pharis.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Previously we observed that newforms obey a strict bias towards root number $+1$ in squarefree levels: at least half of the newforms in $S_k(\Gamma_0(N))$ with root number $+1$ for $N$ squarefree, and it is strictly more than half outside of a few special cases. Subsequently, other authors treated levels which are cubes of squarefree numbers. Here we treat arbitrary levels, and find that if the level is not the square of a squarefree number, this strict bias still holds for any weight. In fact the number of such exceptional levels is finite for fixed weight, and 0 if $k < 12$. We also investigate some variants of this question to better understand the exceptional levels.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $X$ a smooth proper $K$-variety with good reduction. Under a mild assumption on the behaviour of Hodge numbers under reduction modulo $p$, we prove that the existence of a non-zero global 2-form on $X$ implies, after a finite extension of $K$, the existence of $p$-torsion Brauer classes with surjective evaluation map. This implies that any smooth proper variety over a number field which satisfies weak approximation over all finite extensions has no non-zero global 2-form. The proof is based on a prismatic interpretation of Brauer classes with eventually constant evaluation, and a Newton-above-Hodge result for the mod $p$ reduction of prismatic cohomology. This generalises work of Bright and the second-named author beyond the ordinary reduction case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We combine the theory of Cartan-Tanaka prolongations with the Molien-Weyl integral formula and Hilbert-Poincar\'e series to compute the Spencer cohomology groups of the $D=11$ Poincar\'e superalgebra $\mathfrak p$, relevant for superspace formulations of $11$-dimensional supergravity in terms of nonholonomic superstructures. This includes novel fermionic Spencer groups, providing with new cohomology classes of $\mathbb Z$-grading $1$ and form number $2$. Using the Hilbert-Poincar\'e series and the Euler characteristic, we also explore Spencer cohomology contributions in higher form numbers. We then propose a new general definition of filtered deformations of graded Lie superalgebras along first-order fermionic directions and investigate such deformations of $\mathfrak p$ that are maximally supersymmetric. In particular, we establish a no-go type theorem for maximally supersymmetric filtered subdeformations of $\mathfrak p$ along timelike (i.e., generic) first-order fermionic directions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a Dirichlet series $D_{F,G}(s)$ attached to two modular forms $F$ and $G$ of an orthogonal group of real signature $(2,4)$, involving their Fourier--Jacobi coefficients. When $F$ is a Hecke eigenform and $G$ a Poincar\'e series, our main result gives that $D_{F,G}(s)$ is equal to the standard $L$-function attached to $F$, up to an explicit constant. To establish this, we use a correspondence between binary Hermitian forms and ideals of quaternion algebras, as established by Latimer, together with the fact that the even Clifford algebra of a three-dimensional definite quadratic space can be identified with a quaternion division algebra. Our work should be seen as a generalisation of a work of Kohnen and Skoruppa, whose result corresponds to the case of the orthogonal group of real signature $(2,3)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a set $E \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$, the distance set is defined as $\Delta(E) := \{\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\| : \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in E\}$, where $\|\cdot\|$ denotes the standard quadratic form. We investigate the Erd\H{o}s--Falconer distance problem within the flexible class of $(u, s)$--Salem sets introduced by Fraser, with emphasis on the even case $u = 4$. By exploiting the exact identity between $\|\widehat{E}\|_4$ and the fourth additive energy $\Lambda_4(E)$, we prove that quantitative gains in $\Lambda_4(E)$ force the existence of many distances. In particular, for a $(4, s)$--Salem set $E\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ with $d \geq 2$, we prove that if $$ |E|\gg q^{\min\left\{\frac{d+2}{4s+1}, \frac{d+4}{8s}\right\}}, $$ then $E$ determines a positive proportion of all distances. This strictly improves Fraser's threshold of $\frac{d}{4s}$ and the Iosevich-Rudnev bound of $q^{\frac{d+1}{2}}$ in certain parameter ranges. As applications, we obtain improved thresholds for multiplicative subgroups and sets on arbitrary varieties, and establish a sharp incidence bound for Salem sets that is of independent interest in incidence geometry. We also propose a unified conjecture for $(4, s)$--Salem sets that reconciles known bounds and pinpoints the odd-dimensional sphere regime: in odd dimensions $d \geq 3$, the often-cited $\frac{d-1}{2}$ threshold does not follow without additional structure, while on primitive-radius spheres, any $q^{-\epsilon/2}$-gain in the fourth energy improves the standing threshold of $\frac{d}{2}$. This provides a new approach to address this problem.</p></details>

In this paper we use double-affine Hecke algebras to study their basic properties, including that they form an orthogonal basis and that they diagonalise a commutative algebra of difference-reflection operators, and calculate their norms. Finally, we provide two interpretations of intermediate Macdonald polynomials as vector-valued polynomials of which examples can be found in the literature.</p></details>

In these notes, we generalize this result slightly by proving that the same equivalence holds when the L-packet of $\varphi$ is replaced by the micro-packet attached to $\varphi$ by Adams-Barbasch-Vogan. As a corollary, we deduce the Enhanced Shahidi Conjecture for real groups: the Arthur packet attached to an A-parameter $\psi$ of $G$ contains a generic representation if and only if $\psi|_{\mathrm{SL}_2}$ is trivial.</p></details>

The first class is obtained by reducing existing standard modules over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$ to $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell$ with respect to their natural integral structure. The second class is obtained by studying the generic extension map of the cyclical quiver, which was motivated by the construction of certain monomial bases of quantum algebras. In the later case we also manage to prove a modular version of the Langlands classification, similar to the work of Langlands and Zelevinsky over $\mathbb{C}$. We moreover compute the $\ell$-modular Rankin-Selberg $L$-function of both classes and check that they agree with the $L$-functions of their $\mathrm{C}$-parameters constructed by Kurinczuk and Matringe.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop techniques at the interface between differential algebra and model theory to study the following problems of exponential algebraicity: Does a given algebraic differential equation admits an exponentially algebraic solution, that is, a holomorphic solution which is definable in the structure of restricted elementary functions? Do solutions of a given list of algebraic differential equations share a nontrivial exponentially algebraic relation, that is, a nontrivial relation definable in the structure of restricted elementary functions? These problems can be traced back to the work of Abel and Liouville on the problem of integration in finite terms. This article concerns generalizations of their techniques adapted to the study of exponential transcendence and independence problems for more general systems of differential equations. As concrete applications, we obtain exponential transcendence and independence statements for several classical functions: the error function, the Bessel functions, indefinite integrals of algebraic expressions involving Lambert's W-function, the equation of the pendulum, as well as corresponding decidability results.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For fixed positive integers $n,m$, let $\mathrm{Mat}_{n\times m}(\mathbb{C})$ be the affine space consisting of all $n\times m$ complex matrices, and let $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n\times m}]$ be its coordinate ring. For $0\le r\le\min\{m,n\}$, we apply the orbit harmonics method to the finite matrix loci $\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r}$ of rook placements with exactly $r$ rooks, yielding a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n\times\mathfrak{S}_m$-module $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We find one signed and two sign-free graded character formulae for $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We also exhibit some applications of these formulae, such as proving a concise presentation of $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$, and proving some module injections and isomorphisms. Some of our techniques are still valid for involution matrix loci.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish effective bounds on the number of periodic points of degree-$d$ polynomials $\phi$ defined over $p$-adic fields and number fields, under a mild reduction hypothesis that is satisfied by all unicritical polynomials $X^d + c$ with $c$ integral at some prime dividing $d$. As a consequence, we verify the uniform boundedness conjecture for this class of polynomials over number fields $K$, giving the explicit uniform bound $\#\mathrm{Per}_K(\phi) \leq d^{[K:\mathbb{Q}]}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages, 2 figures, comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The purpose of this short note is twofold: First to elucidate some connections between the ``building block'' of Dimofte--Gaiotto--Gukov's $3$D index, known as the tetrahedral index $I_\Delta (m,e)$, and Hahn--Exton's $q$-analogue of the Bessel function $J_\nu (z;q)$. The correspondence between $I_\Delta$ and $J_\nu$ will allow us to translate useful relations from one setting to the other. Second, we want to introduce to the $q$-hypergeometric community some possibly new techniques, theory and conjectures arising from applications of physical mathematics to geometric topology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An algebraic interpretation of matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials (MVOPs) is provided. The construction is based on representations of a ($q$-deformed) Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ into the algebra $\mathrm{End}_{M_n(\mathbb{C})}(M)$ of $M_n(\mathbb{C})$-linear maps over a $M_n(\mathbb{C})$-module $M$. Cases corresponding to the Lie algebras $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{su}(1, 1)$ as well as to the $q$-deformed algebra $\mathfrak{so}_q(3)$ at $q$ a root of unity are presented; they lead to matrix analogs of the Krawtchouk, Meixner and discrete Chebyshev polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X$ be a closed subvariety of an abelian variety $A$ over a global function field $k$ such that the base change of $A$ to an algebraic closure does not have any positive dimensional isotrivial quotient. We prove that every adelic point on $X$ which is the limit of a sequence of $k$-rational points on $A$ is a limit of $k$-rational points on $X$. Assuming finiteness of the Tate-Shafarevich group of $A$, this implies that the rational points on $X$ are dense in the Brauer set of $X$. Similar results are obtained over totally imaginary number fields, conditionally on an adelic Mordell-Lang conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime number. We compute the trivial source character tables of finite Frobenius groups $G$ with an abelian Frobenius complement $H$ and an elementary abelian Frobenius kernel of order $p^2$. More precisely, we deal with all infinite families of such groups which occur in the two extremal cases for the fusion of $p$-subgroups: the case in which there exists exactly one $G$-conjugacy class of non-trivial cyclic $p$-subgroups, and the case in which there exist exactly $p+1$ distinct $G$-conjugacy classes of non-trivial cyclic $p$-subgroups.</p></details>
