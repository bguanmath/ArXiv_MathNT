### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18529v2'>2508.18529</a>\]&nbsp; **On the $(m,1)$-configuration for the HRT Conjecture**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-27 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Vignon Oussa &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.FA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a linear--independence principle for finite families of translates in irreducible, square--integrable modulo the center (SI/Z) representations of step--two nilpotent Lie groups with one--dimensional center. Fix a one--parameter subgroup $\exp(\mathbb R X)$ and a noncentral element $Y$ (not assumed to commute with $X$). For every nonzero smooth vector $f$, any finite collection $\{\pi(\exp(x_k X))f\}_{k=1}^m$ (with distinct parameters $x_k$) of translates along $\exp(\mathbb R X)$, together with the single translate $\pi(\exp Y)f$, is linearly independent. The proof combines Schwartz regularity of matrix coefficients in the noncentral variables with an ergodic log--product estimate on a compact torus generated by commutator phases. Specializing to the Schr\"odinger representation of the Heisenberg group $\mathbb H_d$, we obtain an HRT--type statement for $(m,1)$ configurations (on--line direction with zero $X_{k_0}$--component and rogue $\exp X_{k_0}$) for all nonzero Schwartz windows, without spacing restrictions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-27 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Thomas McConville, James Propp, Bruce E. Sagan &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A hyperbinary partition of the nonnegative integer n is a partition where every part is a power of 2 and every part appears at most twice. We give three applications of the length generating function for such partitions, denoted by h_q(n). Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko defined the q-analogue of a rational number [r/s]_q in various ways, most of which depend directly or indirectly on the continued fraction expansion of r/s. As our first application we show that [r/s]_q = q h_q(n-1)/h_q(n) where r/s occurs as the nth entry in the Calkin-Wilf enumeration of the non-negative rationals. Next we consider fence posets which are those which can be obtained from a sequence of chains by alternately pasting together maxima and minima. For every n we show there is a fence poset F(n) whose lattice of order ideals is isomorphic to the poset of hyperbinary partitions of n ordered by refinement. For our last application, Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko also showed that [r/s]_q can be computed by taking products of certain matrices which are q-analogues of the standard generators for the special linear group SL(2,R). We express the entries of these products in terms of the polynomials h_q(n).</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04458v7'>2308.04458</a>\]&nbsp; **The number of primes in short intervals and numerical calculations for Harman's sieve**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-27 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Runbo Li &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The author gives nontrivial upper and lower bounds for the number of primes in the interval $[x - x^{\theta}, x]$ for some $0.52 \leqslant \theta < 0.525$, showing that the interval $[x - x^{0.52}, x]$ contains prime numbers for all sufficiently large $x$. This refines a result of Baker, Harman and Pintz (2001) and gives an affirmative answer to Harman and Pintz's argument. New arithmetical information, a delicate sieve decomposition, various techniques in Harman's sieve and accurate estimates for integrals are used to good effect.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-27 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tommaso Aschieri, Błażej Ruba, Jan Philip Solovej &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math-ph &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 38 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study Berezin-Toeplitz quantization of complex projective spaces $\mathbb{CP}^{d-1}$ and obtain full asymptotic expansions of the Berezin transformation and of products of Toeplitz operators. In each case, the remainder is controlled by the next term of the expansion, either through a positivity-preserving transformation or via an operator inequality. This leads to bounds which are optimal in terms of the required regularity and feature sharp or asymptotically sharp constants.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the sign constancy for the values of certain weighted summatory functions of the von Mangoldt function implies the Riemann hypothesis or the generalized Riemann hypothesis for Dirichlet $L$-functions. While such sign constancy is challenging to establish individually, we prove that the summatory functions under study have constant signs on average.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19947v1'>2508.19947</a>\]&nbsp; **On a non-abelian analogue of a conjecture of Michael Stoll**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-27 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** L. Alexander Betts &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We formulate a non-abelian generalisation of a conjecture of Stoll, which conjecturally describes the structure of the loci cut out by Kim's method of non-abelian Chabauty. We prove the rank 0 quadratic case of this conjecture, which in particular determines the structure of the quadratic Chabauty locus for once-punctured elliptic curves of rank 0. The proof involves using a variant of the geometric quadratic Chabauty method of Edixhoven and Lido to reduce to an unlikely intersections problem, and ultimately to known results about the relative Manin--Mumford Conjecture.</p></details>
