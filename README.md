 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Abigail Price, Ada Stelzer, Alexander Yong &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Revision: adds an appendix detailing connections between the main results, prior work on Hilbert series of matrix Schubert varieties, and open problems on their minimal free resolutions. 38 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Matrix Schubert varieties (Fulton '92) carry natural actions of Levi groups. Their coordinate rings are thereby Levi-representations; what is a combinatorial counting rule for the multiplicities of their irreducibles? When the Levi group is a torus, (Knutson-Miller '04) answers the question. We present a general solution, a common refinement of the multigraded Hilbert series, the Cauchy identity, and the Littlewood-Richardson rule. Our result applies to any ``bicrystalline'' algebraic variety; we define these using the operators of (Kashiwara '95) and of (Danilov-Koshevoi '05, van Leeuwen '06). The proof introduces a ``filtered'' generalization of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Daewoong Cheong, Thang Pham, Dung The Tran &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a functional Loomis--Whitney framework on the finite Heisenberg groups $\mathbb{H}^n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and discover connections to the boundedness and orthogonal projection problems. For $n=1$ we determine the sharp region of exponents $(u_1,u_2)$ for which the associated bilinear projection form is bounded uniformly in $q$, namely $$ \frac{1}{u_1}+\frac{2}{u_2}\le 2 \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{2}{u_1}+\frac{1}{u_2}\le 2, $$ which includes the endpoint $L^{3/2}\times L^{3/2}\to L^1$. For general $n$ we prove a multilinear estimate at the critical exponent $$ u=\frac{n(2n+1)}{n+1}, $$ via an induction on $n$ that exploits the group's fiber structure together with multilinear interpolation. Specializing to indicators yields a sharp Loomis--Whitney type set inequality that controls $|K|$ for every finite $K\subset \mathbb{H}^n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ by the sizes of its $2n$ Heisenberg projections $\{\pi_j(K)\}$, forcing a large projection in every configuration. A straightening map then converts these bounds into covering statements by additive cosets and provides a new approach to the orthogonal projection problem onto the vertical hyperplanes $\{x_j=0\}$, which presents an interesting link between commutative and non-commutative settings. The obtained results are optimal up to absolute constants, and in the planar case $n=1$, when the size of the set is not too small, our bound can be sharpened further using a point--line incidence estimate.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 42 pages, added comparison with geometric extensions and a discussion on general affine quivers

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose an extension of the theory of parity sheaves, which allows for non-locally constant sheaves along strata. Our definition is tailored for proving the existence of (proper, quasihereditary, etc) stratifications of $\mathrm{Ext}$-algebras. We use this to study quiver Schur algebras $A(\alpha)$ for the cyclic quiver of length $2$. We find a polynomial quasihereditary structure on $A(\alpha)$ compatible with the categorified PBW basis of McNamara and Kleshchev-Muth, and sharpen their results to arbitrary characteristic. We also prove that semicuspidal algebras of $A(n\delta)$ are polynomial quasihereditary covers of semicuspidal algebras of the corresponding KLR algebra $R(n\delta)$, and compute them diagrammatically.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study graduated orders over completed group rings of $1$-dimensional admissible $p$-adic Lie groups, and verify the equivariant $p$-adic Artin conjecture for such orders. Following Jacobinski and Plesken, we obtain a formula for the conductor of a graduated order into a self-dual order. We also refine Nickel's central conductor formula by determining a hitherto implicit exponent $r_\chi$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ and $B$ be sets in a finite vector space. In this paper, we study the magnitude of the set $A\cap f(B)$, where $f$ runs through a set of transformations. More precisely, we will focus on the cases that the set of transformations is given by orthogonal matrices or orthogonal projections. We prove that if $A, B\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ satisfy some natural conditions, then, for almost every $g\in O(d)$, there are at least $\gg q^d$ elements $z\in \mathbb{F}_q^d$ such that $$|A\cap (g(B)+z)| \sim \frac{|A||B|}{q^d}.$$ This implies that $|A-gB|\gg q^d$ for almost every $g\in O(d)$. In the flavor of expanding functions, with $|A|\le |B|$, we also show that the image $A-gB$ grows exponentially. In two dimensions, the result simply says that if $|A|=q^x$ and $|B|=q^y$, as long as $0<x\le y<2$, then for almost every $g\in O(2)$, we can always find $\epsilon=\epsilon(x, y)>0$ such that $|A-gB|\gg |B|^{1+\epsilon}$. To prove these results, we need to develop new and robust incidence bounds between points and rigid motions by using a number of techniques including algebraic methods and discrete Fourier analysis. Our results are essentially sharp in odd dimensions. In the prime field plane, we further employ recent $L^2$ distance bounds and point-line/plane incidence machinery to derive improvements. Notable applications include a strong prime field analogue of a question of Mattila related to the Falconer distance problem, the Rotational Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance problem, and a quadratic expansion law. Taken together, the results in this paper present a robust two-way link between intersection phenomena and distance problems over finite fields, with dimension-uniform consequences and sharpness in several ranges.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Anton Alekseev, Matthias Christandl, Thomas C. Fraser &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 46 pages, 2 figures, 3 appendices

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Horn's problem is concerned with characterizing the eigenvalues $(a,b,c)$ of Hermitian matrices $(A,B,C)$ satisfying the constraint $A+B=C$ and forming the edges of a triangle in the space of Hermitian matrices. It has deep connections to tensor product invariants, Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, geometric invariant theory and the intersection theory of Schubert varieties. This paper concerns the tetrahedral Horn problem which aims to characterize the tuples of eigenvalues $(a,b,c,d,e,f)$ of Hermitian matrices $(A,B,C,D,E,F)$ forming the edges of a tetrahedron, and thus satisfying the constraints $A+B=C$, $B+D=F$, $D+C=E$ and $A+F=E$. Here we derive new inequalities satisfied by the Schur-polynomials of such eigenvalues and, using eigenvalue estimation techniques from quantum information theory, prove their satisfaction up to degree $k$ implies the existence of approximate solutions with error $O(\ln k / k)$. Moreover, the existence of these tetrahedra is related to the semiclassical asymptotics of the $6j$-symbols for the unitary group $U(n)$, which are maps between multiplicity spaces that encode the associativity relation for tensor products of irreducible representations. Using our techniques, we prove the asymptotics of norms of these $6j$-symbols are either inverse-polynomial or exponential depending on whether there exists such tetrahedra of Hermitian matrices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a construction of radial Fourier interpolation formulas in dimensions 3 and 4 using Maass--Poincar\'e type series. As a corollary we obtain explicit formulas for the basis functions of these interpolation formulas in terms of what we call real-variable Kloosterman sums, which were previously introduced by Stoller. We also improve the bounds on the corresponding basis functions $a_{n,d}(x)$, $d=3,4$, for fixed $x$, in terms of the index $n$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Christoffer Söderberg &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 31 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study $2$-representation finite $\mathbb{K}$-algebras obtained from tensor products of tensor algebras of species. In earlier work we computed the higher preprojective algebra of said algebras to be given as Jacobian algebras of certain species with potential $(S, W)$, which are self-injective and finite dimensional. Truncating these Jacobian algebras yields a rich source of $2$-representation finite $\mathbb{K}$-algebras. Under suitable assumptions, we prove that the set of all cuts of $(S, W)$ is transitive under successive cut-mutations. Furthermore, we show that cuts and cut-mutation correspond to truncated Jacobian algebras and $2$-APR tilting, respectively. Consequently, under certain assumptions, all truncated Jacobian algebras are related to each other via $2$-APR tilting. We produce various new examples of $2$-representation finite $\mathbb{K}$-algebras.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tim Berland &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 32 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we prove a sharpened asymptotic for the growth of analytic torsion of congruence quotients of $\SL(n,\R)/\SO(n)$ in terms of the volume. The result is based on bounds on the trace of the heat kernel, allowing control of the large time behaviour of certain orbital integrals, as well as a careful analysis of error terms. The result requires the existence of $\lambda$-strongly acyclic representations, which we define and show exists in plenitude for any $\lambda>0$. The motivation is possible applications to torsion in the cohomology of arithmetic groups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 19 pages. Added section on cohomological interpretation and minor corrections

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let A be an abelian threefold defined over a number field K with potential multiplication by an imaginary quadratic field M. If A has signature (2,1) and the multiplication by M is defined over an at most quadratic extension, we attach to A an elliptic curve defined over K with potential complex multiplication by M, whose attached Galois representation is determined by the Hecke character associated to the determinant of the compatible system of lambda-adic representations of A. We deduce that if the geometric endomorphism algebra of A is an imaginary quadratic field, then it necessarily has class number bounded by [K:Q].</p></details>

> **Comment:** V3: typos corrected, comments added, main results unchanged

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E$ be a set in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ and $S$ be a set of maps from $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ to $\mathbb{F}_p^n$. We define $$ S (E) := \bigcup_{f\in S} f(E) = \left\lbrace f(x) \colon x\in E, f\in S \right\rbrace.$$ In this paper, we establish sharp lower bounds on the size of $S(E)$ when $S$ consists of matrices from either the special linear group $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ or the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_1(\mathbb{F}_p)$. Our proofs are based on novel results on algebraic incidence-type structures associated with these groups. We also discuss higher-dimensional generalizations.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jixiang Wan, Guangyan Zhu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(x, y)$ and $[x, y]$ denote the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of the integers $x$ and $y$ respectively. We denote by $|T|$ the number of elements of a finite set $T$. Let $a,b$ and $n$ be positive integers and let $S=\{x_1, ..., x_n\}$ be a set of $n$ distinct positive integers. We denote by $(S^a)$ (resp. $[S^a]$) the $n\times n$ matrix whose $(i,j)$-entry is the $a$th power of $(x_i,x_j)$ (resp. $[x_i,x_j]$). For any $x\in S$, define $G_{S}(x):=\{d\in S: d<x, d|x \ {\rm and} \ (d|y|x, y\in S)\Rightarrow y\in \{d,x\}\}$. In this paper, we show that if $a|b$ and $S$ is gcd closed (namely, $(x_i, x_j)\in S$ for all integers $i$ and $j$ with $1\le i, j\le n$) and $\max_{x\in S}\{|G_S (x)|\}=2$ and the condition $\mathcal{G}$ being satisfied (i.e., any element $x\in S$ satisfies that either $|G_S(x)|\le 1$, or $G_S(x)=\{y_1,y_2\}$ satisfying that $[y_1,y_2]=x$ and $(y_1,y_2)\in G_S(y_1)\cap G_S(y_2)$), then $(S^a)|(S^b), (S^a)|[S^b]$ and $[S^a]|[S^b]$ hold in the ring $M_{n}({\bf Z})$. Furthermore, we show the existences of gcd-closed sets $S$ such that $S$ does not satisfy the condition $\mathcal{G}$ and such factorizations are true. Our result extends the Feng-Hong-Zhao theorem gotten in 2009. This also partially confirms a conjecture raised by Hong in [S.F. Hong, Divisibility among power GCD matrices and power LCM matrices, {\it Bull. Aust. Math. Soc.}, doi:10.1017/S0004972725100361].</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2,v3: results on oriented exchange graphs added. v4: resulsts on additive/monoidal cluster categorification added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider skew-symmetrizable (upper) cluster algebras with a compatible Poisson structure, called $\mathsf{\Lambda}$-(upper) cluster algebras. For any two good elements (e.g., cluster monomials) in a $\mathsf{\Lambda}$-upper cluster algebra, we introduce two invariants, called tropical invariant and $F$-invariant. We prove that (i) the product of two cluster monomials is still a cluster monomial if and only if their $F$-invariant is zero; (ii) if two cluster variables are log-canonical, then they are contained in the same cluster; and (iii) the notion of $F$-invariant for a pair of cluster monomials can be defined for any (upper) cluster algebra, regardless of whether it is a $\mathsf{\Lambda}$-(upper) cluster algebra. When restricting to cluster monomials, we prove that the tropical invariant and $F$-invariant respectively coincide with the $\Lambda$-invariant and twice $\mathfrak{d}$-invariant in the monoidal cluster categorification using various monoidal subcategories of finite-dimensional modules over quantum affine algebras and quiver Hecke algebras; and we prove that the $F$-invariant coincides with the $E$-invariant in the additive cluster categorification using the theory of quivers with potentials. Inspired by $F$-invariant, we introduce the dominant sets for seeds of cluster algebras as a replacement of torsion classes for $\tau$-tilting pairs in $\tau$-tilting theory. With the help of the dominant sets, we prove that the oriented exchange graphs of cluster algebras are acyclic. In particular, this implies that green mutations induce a partial order on the set of seeds (up to seed equivalence) of cluster algebras. We prove that the oriented exchange graphs of cluster algebras coincide with the Hasse quivers of the above posets of seeds.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 82 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Peter Scholze has raised the question whether some variant of the $q$-de Rham complex is already defined over the Habiro ring $\mathcal H = \lim_{m\in\mathbb N}\mathbb Z[q]_{(q^m-1)}^\wedge$. We show that such a variant exists whenever the $q$-de Rham complex can be equipped with a "$q$-Hodge filtration": a $q$-deformation of the Hodge filtration, subject to some reasonable conditions. To any such $q$-Hodge filtration we associate a small modification of the $q$-de Rham complex, which we call the $q$-Hodge complex, and show that it descends canonically to the Habiro ring. This construction recovers and generalises the Habiro ring of a number field of Garoufalidis-Scholze-Wheeler-Zagier and is closely related to the $q$-de Rham--Witt complexes from previous work of the author as well as, conjecturally, to Scholze's analytic Habiro stack. While there's no canonical $q$-Hodge filtration in general, we show that it does exist in many cases of interest. For example, for a smooth scheme $X$ over $\mathbb Z$, the $q$-de Rham complex can be equipped with a canonical $q$-Hodge filtration as soon as one inverts all primes $p\leq \dim(X/\mathbb Z)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unfolding singular points in linear differential equations is a classical technique for studying the properties of irregular singularities by relating them to regular singularities. In this paper, we propose a general framework for unfolding unramified irregular singularities of meromorphic connections on the trivial principal $G$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. One of our main results is the description of the unfolding of singularities in terms of deformations of their moduli spaces. We show that every moduli space of irreducible meromorphic $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ can be deformed into a moduli space of irreducible Fuchsian $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. Furthermore, we study the unfolding of additive Deligne-Simpson problems, in which the unfolding of irregular singularities naturally generates a family of such problems. As an application of our main result, we prove that a Deligne-Simpson problem for $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities admits a solution if and only if every unfolded Deligne-Simpson problem in the family admits a simultaneous solution. We also provide a combinatorial and diagrammatic framework of the unfolding process in terms of spectral types and unfolding diagrams. Finally, we address a conjecture proposed by Oshima concerning the existence of irreducible $G$-connections that realize prescribed spectral types and their unfoldings. Our main result gives an affirmative answer to this conjecture.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 28 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, the generating functions of Garvans so-called $k$-ranks are used, to define a family of mock Eisenstein series. The $k$-rank moments are then expressed as partition traces of these functions. We explore the modular properties of this new family, give recursive formulas for them involving divisor like sums, and prove that their Fourier coefficient are integral. Furthermore, we show that these functions lie in an algebra that is generated only by derivatives up to a finite order but is nevertheless closed under differentiation. In the process, we also answer a question raised by Bringmann, Pandey and van Ittersum by showing that the divisor like sum $$\left(1-2^{\ell-1} \right) \frac{B_\ell}{2\ell}+ \sum_{2n-1 \geq bm \geq b} (2n-bm)^{\ell-1} q^{mn} - \sum_{m-1 \geq 2bn \geq 2b} (m-2bn)^{\ell-1} q^{mn},$$ has a quasi-completion, when $b\geq 3$ is odd.</p></details>

The same outer multiplicities were previously computed by Misra and Wilson in terms of counting certain sets of tableaux. By comparing these two expressions and by explicitly exhibiting a combinatorial description of level-$2$ affine Weyl group orbits, we establish the existence of a bijection between the Misra-Wilson set of tableaux and a disjoint union of certain sets of multipartitions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let N be the maximal unipotent subgroup in the simple algebraic group of type {\Phi}. It naturally acts on the space dual to the Lie algebra n of N, and this action is called coadjoint. Such orbits play the key role in the orbit method of A.A. Kirillov. In this work, we classify the orbits of this action in the case of {\Phi} = F_4 in terms of supports of canonical forms. This means that we will present a set S of linear forms such that for any coadjoint orbit there exists a unique form from S belonging to that orbit. The set of canonical forms will be explicitly described in terms of supports.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a strong form of the cohomological integrality theorem, decomposing the cohomology of smooth symmetric stacks as the cohomological Hall induction of the intersection cohomology of the good moduli spaces of stacks of graded points. This generalizes the previous result by the second author together with Bu--Davison--Ib\'a\~nez Nu\~nez--P\u{a}durariu to non-orthogonal stacks, and confirms a conjecture of the first author that the algebraic BPS cohomology of the quotient stack of a symmetric representation matches the intersection cohomology group whenever it is nonzero. As a consequence, we obtain a version of the cohomological integrality theorem for general 0-shifted symplectic stacks with good moduli spaces, as well as for the character stacks of general compact oriented $3$-manifolds with reductive gauge groups. As an application, we prove Halpern-Leistner's conjecture on the purity of the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks admitting proper good moduli spaces. Our proof combines a cohomological bound for the algebraic BPS cohomology, due to the first author and based on Efimov's lemma, with a vanishing-cycle argument due to the second author in collaboration with Bu--Davison--Ib\'a\~nez Nu\~nez--P\u{a}durariu. We also give a purely geometric proof of the required cohomological bound.</p></details>

Assume that $E$ has potentially multiplicative reduction. We classify when all $G_{\mathbb{Q}_\ell}$-isomorphisms $\phi : E[p] \to E'[p]$ have the same symplectic type and prove two new criteria to determine the type in that case. In particular, when both curves have multiplicative reduction, our results cover the case of unramified $p$-torsion which is not covered by the original criterion due to Kraus and Oesterl\'e. We also give a variant of a symplectic criterion for the case when both $E$ and~$E'$ have good reduction and provide an algorithm to apply it.

> **Comment:** 87 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There is considerable current interest in applications of generalised Lie algebras graded by an abelian group $\Gamma$ with a commutative factor $\omega$. This calls for a systematic development of the theory of such algebraic structures. We treat the representation theory and invariant theory of the $\Gamma$-graded general linear Lie $\omega$-algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(V(\Gamma, \omega))$, where $V(\Gamma, \omega)$ is any finite dimensional $\Gamma$-graded vector space. Generalised Howe dualities over symmetric $(\Gamma, \omega)$-algebras are established, from which we derive the first and second fundamental theorems of invariant theory, and a generalised Schur-Weyl duality. The unitarisable $\mathfrak{gl}(V(\Gamma, \omega))$-modules for two ``compact'' $\ast$-structures are classified, and it is shown that the tensor powers of $V(\Gamma, \omega)$ and their duals are unitarisable for the two compact $\ast$-structures respectively. A Hopf $(\Gamma, \omega)$-algebra is constructed, which gives rise to a group functor corresponding to the general linear group in the $\Gamma$-graded setting. Using this Hopf $(\Gamma, \omega)$-algebra, we realise simple tensor modules and their dual modules by mimicking the classic Borel-Weil theorem. We also analyse in some detail the case with $\Gamma={\mathbb Z}^{\dim{V(\Gamma, \omega)}}$ and $\omega$ depending on a complex parameter $q\ne 0$, where $\mathfrak{gl}(V(\Gamma, \omega))$ shares common features with the quantum general linear (super)group, but is better behaved especially when $q$ is a root of unity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A Kronecker coefficient is the multiplicity of an irreducible representation of a finite group $G$ in a tensor product of irreducible representations. We define Kronecker Hecke algebras and use them as a tool to study Kronecker coefficients in finite groups. We show that the number of simultaneous conjugacy classes in a finite group $G$ is equal to the sum of squares of Kronecker coefficients, and the number of simultaneous conjugacy classes that are closed under elementwise inversion is the sum of Kronecker coefficients weighted by Frobenius-Schur indicators. We use these tools to investigate which finite groups have multiplicity-free tensor products. We introduce the class of doubly real groups, and show that they are precisely the real groups which have multiplicity-free tensor products. We show that non-Abelian groups of odd order, non-Abelian finite simple groups, and most finite general linear groups do not have multiplicity-free tensor products.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The main goal of this paper is to extend two fundamental combinatorial results in Schubert calculus on flag manifolds from equivariant cohomology and $K$-theory to equivariant elliptic cohomology. The foundations of elliptic Schubert calculus were laid in a few relatively recent papers by Rim\'anyi, Weber, and Kumar. They include the recursive construction of elliptic Schubert classes via generalizations of the cohomology and $K$-theory push-pull operators and the study of the corresponding Demazure algebra. We derive a Billey-type formula for the localization of elliptic Schubert classes (for partial flag manifolds of arbitrary type) and a pipe dream model for their polynomial representatives in the case of type $A$ flag manifolds. The latter extends the pipe dream model for double Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials. We also study the degeneration of elliptic Schubert classes to $K$-theory, which recovers the corresponding classical formulas.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The theory of factor-equivalence of integral lattices establishes a far-reaching relationship between the Galois module structure of the unit group of the ring of integers of a number field and its arithmetic. For a number field $K$ that is Galois over $\mathbb{Q}$ or an imaginary quadratic field, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition on the quotients of class numbers of subfields of $K$, for the quotient $E_{K}$ of the unit group of the ring of integers of $K$ modulo the subgroup of roots of unity to be factor equivalent to the standard cyclic Galois module. Using strong arithmetic properties of totally real $p$-rational number fields, we prove that the non-abelian $p$-rational $p$-extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ do not admit Minkowski units, thereby extending a result of Burns to non-abelian number fields. We also study the relative Galois module structure of $E_{L}$ for varying Galois extensions $L/F$ of totally real $p$-rational number fields whose Galois groups are isomorphic to a fixed finite group $G$. In that case, we prove that there exists a finite set $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{Z}_p[G]$-lattices such that for every $L$, $\mathbb{Z}_{p} \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} E_{L}$ is factor equivalent to $\mathbb{Z}_{p}[G]^{n} \oplus X$ as $\mathbb{Z}_p[G]$-lattices for some $X \in \Omega$ and an integer $n \geq 0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The cluster variety of triples of flags (associated with a split simple Lie group of Dynkin type Delta) plays a key role in higher Teichmuller theory as developed by Fock-Goncharov, Jiarui Fei, Ian Le, ... and Goncharov-Shen. We refer to it as the basic triangle associated with Delta. In this paper, for simply laced Delta, we construct and study a Higgs category (in the sense of Yilin Wu) which we expect to categorify the basic triangle. This category is a certain exact dg category (in the sense of Xiaofa Chen) which is Frobenius and stably 2-Calabi-Yau. We show that it has indeed the expected cyclic group symmetry and that its derived category has the expected braid group symmetry. A key ingredient in our construction is a conjecture by Merlin Christ, whose proof occupies most of this paper. The proof is based on a new description of the Higgs category in terms of Gorenstein projective dg modules. Our techniques are in the spirit of Orlov in his work on triangulated categories of graded B-branes.</p></details>

In that regard, our main results may be seen as an Euler system incarnation of the factorization formula of Bella\"iche and Dasgupta.

> **Comment:** This is our submission for the (ICM) Proceedings 2026

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we explore several threads arising from our recent joint work on arithmetic holonomy bounds, which were originally devised to prove new irrationality results based on the method of Ap\'ery limits. We propose a new method to address effective Diophantine approximation on the projective line and the multiplicative group. This method, and all our other results in the paper, emerged from quantifying our holonomy bounds in a way that directly yields effective measures of irrationality and linear independence. Applying these to a dihedral algebraic construction, we derive good effective irrationality measures for high order roots of an algebraic number, in an approach that might be considered a multivalent continuation of the classical hypergeometric method of Thue, Siegel, and Baker. A well-known Dirichlet approximation argument of Bombieri allows one to derive from this the classical effective Diophantine theorems, hitherto only approachable by Baker's linear forms in logarithms or by Bombieri's equivariant Thue--Siegel method. These include the algorithmic resolution of the two-variable $S$-unit equation, the Thue--Mahler equation, and the hyperelliptic and superelliptic equations, as well as the Baker--Feldman effective power sharpening of Liouville's theorem.

> **Comment:** This is a substantial rewrite, making all of the combinatorial algorithms more explicit, and filling a gap in the previous proof of the main theorem for the orthogonal group

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $H$ be a complex reductive group, with finite-dimensional representations $W$ and $U$. The module of covariants for $W$ of type $U$ is the space of all $H$-equivariant polynomial maps $\varphi: W \longrightarrow U$. In this paper, we take $H$ to be one of the classical groups $\mathrm{GL}(V)$, $\mathrm{O}(V)$, or $\mathrm{Sp}(V)$, where $W$ is a direct sum of copies of $V$ and $V^*$, and $U$ is an arbitrary rational representation (with $U$ restricted to exterior powers of $V$ in the $H= \mathrm{O}(V)$ case). Our main result gives uniform Stanley decompositions of these modules of covariants, with Stanley spaces parametrized by combinatorial objects we call jellyfish. As a corollary, we write down the Hilbert series as a finite sum of rational functions, each with a combinatorial interpretation in terms of lattice paths. Notably, these results do not rely on the module being Cohen-Macaulay. We further apply our methods to invariant rings for $\mathrm{SL}(V)$ and $\mathrm{SO}(V)$. Our proofs (for $H = \mathrm{GL}(V)$ and $\mathrm{Sp}(V)$) rely on previous work by Jackson on standard monomial theory for dual reductive pairs, since classical modules of covariants can be viewed via Howe duality as Harish-Chandra modules of unitary highest weight representations of a certain real reductive group. As a first step toward extending this program to arbitrary unitary highest weight representations (including those of the exceptional groups), we establish analogous results uniformly for the Wallach representations of type ADE.</p></details>

They proved that RoCK blocks of double covers are Morita equivalent to standard ``local" blocks via bimodules with endopermutation source. Based on this, Kleshchev and Livesey proved that these RoCK blocks are splendidly Rickard equivalent to their Brauer correspondents. The analogous result for blocks of symmetric groups, a theorem of Chuang and Kessar, was an important step in Chuang and Rouquier ultimately proving Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for symmetric groups. In this paper we show that in most cases the Morita and splendid Rickard equivalences constructed by Kleshchev and Livesey descend to the ring $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p$-adic integers, hence prove Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for most of these RoCK blocks.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Implicit models, an emerging model class, compute outputs by iterating a single parameter block to a fixed point. This architecture realizes an infinite-depth, weight-tied network that trains with constant memory, significantly reducing memory needs for the same level of performance compared to explicit models. While it is empirically known that these compact models can often match or even exceed larger explicit networks by allocating more test-time compute, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. We study this gap through a nonparametric analysis of expressive power. We provide a strict mathematical characterization, showing that a simple and regular implicit operator can, through iteration, progressively express more complex mappings. We prove that for a broad class of implicit models, this process lets the model's expressive power scale with test-time compute, ultimately matching a much richer function class. The theory is validated across three domains: image reconstruction, scientific computing, and operations research, demonstrating that as test-time iterations increase, the complexity of the learned mapping rises, while the solution quality simultaneously improves and stabilizes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a $(0,p)$-mixed characteristic complete discrete valued field $\mathcal{K}$ we define a class of finite field extensions called pseudo-perfect extensions such that the natural restriction map on the mod-$p$ Milnor $K$-groups is trivial for all $p\neq 2$. This implies that pseudo-perfect extensions split every element in $H^i(\mathcal{K},\mu_p^{\otimes i-1})$ yielding period-index bounds for Brauer classes as well as higher cohomology classes of $\mathcal{K}$. As a corollary, we prove a conjecture of Bhaskhar-Haase that the Brauer $p$-dimension of $\mathcal{K}$ is upper bounded by $n+1$ where $n$ is the $p$-rank of the residue field. When $\mathcal{K}$ is the fraction field of a complete regular ring, we show that any $p$-torsion element in $Br(\mathcal{K})$ that is nicely ramified is split by a pseudo-perfect extension yielding a bound on its index. We then use patching techniques of Harbater, Hartmann and Krashen to show that the Brauer $p$-dimension of semi-global fields of residual characteristic $p$ is at most $n+2$. This bound is sharper than previously known in the work of Parimala-Suresh.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Introduced by Sheekey in 2016, the study of scattered polynomials over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$ has been increasing regarding the classification of those that are \textit{exceptional}, i.e., polynomials which are scattered over infinite field extensions, are limited to the cases where their index $t$ is small, or a prime number larger than the q-degree k of the polynomial, or an integer smaller than k in the case where k is a prime. In this paper, we focus on the scattered behavior of $S(x)=\sum_{i=1}^k a_ix^{q^{r_i}} \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}[x]$, where $q$ is a power of an odd prime, $0<r_1<r_2< \cdots<r_k<n$ and $a_1, \cdots,a_k \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}^*$ such that the order of $a_i$'s divide $(q^{r_1}-1)$, $\forall i=2,3,\cdots,k $. We explore a connection between $S(x)$ and the cyclotomic mapping polynomial. As an application, in three parts, we discuss the scattered behavior of $S(x)$ of index $t$ where $t=r_1$, or $0<t<r_1$, or $r_1<t<n$. Starting with the pseudoregulus type of index $t \geq 0$, we present conditions to verify scattered behavior of $S(x)$ of index $r_1$. With some additional conditions, we do the same in case $0<t<r_1$ or $r_1<t<n$. In particular, for $S(x)=a_1x^{q^{r_1}}+a_2x^{q^{r_2}} \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}[x]$ with $a_1,a_2 \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}^*$ such that $|a_2| \mid q^{r_1}-1$, we present a necessary and sufficient condition to verify its scattered behavior of index $t \in \{r_1,r_2\}$. We also connect such scattered binomials with the well known \textit{Lunardon-Polverino} polynomial. With conditions on $\delta, q,n$, and $r$; we present a new family of \textit{exceptional scattered polynomial} $S(x)=x^q+\delta x^{q^{(2r+1)}} \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}[x]$ of index $\{r+1\}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a number field and let $\pi \colon X \rightarrow \mathbb{P}_k^1$ be a smooth conic bundle. We show that if $X/k$ has four geometric singular fibers with $X(\mathbb{A}_k)\neq \emptyset$ or non-trivial Brauer group, then $X$ satisfies the Hasse principle over any even degree extension $L/k$. Furthermore for arbitrary $X$ we show that, conditional on Schinzel's hypothesis, $X$ satisfies the Hasse principle over all but finitely many quadratic extensions of $k$. We prove these results by showing the Brauer-Manin obstruction vanishes and then apply fibration method results of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene, following Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Sansuc.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a calculus based on graph enumeration for calculating $S_n$-equivariant motivic invariants of graphically stratified moduli spaces. We apply our theory to the Deligne--Mumford moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}$ and to the space of torus-fixed stable maps $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}(X, \beta)^{\mathbb{C}^\star}$ when the target $X$ admits an appropriate $\mathbb{C}^\star$-action, deriving new formulas in each case. A key role is played by the P\'olya--Petersen character of a graph, which enriches P\'olya's classical cycle index polynomial. This character is valued in an algebra $\Lambda^{[2]}$ of wreath product symmetric functions, which we study from combinatorial and representation--theoretic perspectives. We prove that this algebra may be viewed as the Grothendieck ring of the category of polynomial functors which take symmetric sequences of vector spaces to vector spaces, building on foundational work of Macdonald. This leads to a plethystic action of $\Lambda^{[2]}$ on the ring $\Lambda$ of ordinary symmetric functions. Using this action, we derive our formulas, which ultimately involve only ordinary symmetric functions and the Grothendieck ring of mixed Hodge structures.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 11 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is motivated by a strong version of Feit's conjecture, first formulated by the authors in joint work with A. Kleshchev and P. H. Tiep in 2025, concerning the conductor $c(\chi)$ of an irreducible character $\chi$ of a finite group $G$. We connect the conjecture with the following construction: For any positive integer $n$ dividing the exponent of $G$ and for any character $\chi$ of $G$, we introduce an integer-valued invariant $S(G,\chi,n)$ which can be defined as the sum of certain coefficients of the canonical Brauer induction formula of $\chi$, or alternatively as the multiplicity of the trivial character in a specified integral linear combination of Adams operations of $\chi$. We show two facts about this invariant. The first seems of independent interest (apart from Feit's conjecture): $S(G,\chi,n)$ is always non-negative, and it is positive if and only if a representation affording $\chi$ involves an eigenvalue of order $n$. Secondly, the strong version of Feit's conjecture holds for an irreducible character $\chi$ if and only if $S(G,\chi, c(\chi))>0$.</p></details>

In this work we focus on $D_4$-quartic fields with signature $(2,1)$; such fields have a rank $2$ unit group. Viewing the unit lattice as a point of $GL_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash \mathfrak{h}$, we prove that every lattice which arises this way must correspond to a transcendental point on the boundary of a certain fundamental domain of $GL_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash \mathfrak{h}$. Moreover, we produce three explicit (algebraic) points of $GL_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash \mathfrak{h}$ which are limit points of the set of (points associated to) unit lattices of $D_4$-quartic fields with signature $(2,1)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study a new class of topological $G$-spaces generalizing the classical flag manifolds $G/T$ of compact connected Lie groups. These spaces, which we call the $m$-quasi-flag manifolds $ F_m = F_m(G,T) $, are topological realizations of the algebras $ Q_k(W) $ of $k$-quasi-invariant polynomials of the Weyl group $ W $ in the sense that their (even-dimensional) $G$-equivariant cohomology $ H_G(F_m, {\mathbb C}) $ is naturally isomorphic to $ Q_k(W) $, where $ m $ is a $W$-invariant integer-valued multiplicity function on the system of roots of $W$ and $ k = \frac{m}{2}$ or $ \frac{m+1}{2}$ depending on whether $m$ is even or odd. Many topological properties and algebraic structures related to the flag manifolds can be extended to quasi-flag manifolds. We compute the cohomology of quasi-flag manifolds by constructing their rational algebraic models in terms of coaffine stacks -- a certain kind of derived stacks introduced by B.To\"en and J. Lurie to provide an algebro-geometric framework for rational homotopy theory. Besides cohomology, we also compute the equivariant K-theory of quasi-flag manifolds and extend some of our cohomological results to the multiplicative setting. On the topological side, our approach is strongly influenced by the classical work on homotopy decompositions of classifying spaces of compact Lie groups; however, the diagrams that we use in our decompositions do not arise from collections of subgroups of $G$ but rather from moment graphs -- combinatorial objects introduced in a different area of topology called the GKM theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe a framework for encoding cluster combinatorics using categorical methods. We give a definition of an abstract cluster structure, which captures the essence of cluster mutation at a tropical level and show that cluster algebras, cluster varieties, cluster categories and surface models all have associated abstract cluster structures. For the first two classes, we also show that they can be constructed from abstract cluster structures. By defining a suitable notion of morphism of abstract cluster structures, we introduce a category of these and show that it has several desirable properties, such as initial and terminal objects and finite products and coproducts. We also prove that rooted cluster morphisms of cluster algebras give rise to morphisms of the associated abstract cluster structures, so that our framework includes a version of the extant category of cluster algebras. We can do more, however, because we can relate different types of representation of abstract cluster structures (cluster algebra, varieties, categories) directly via morphisms of their associated abstract cluster structures, even though no direct map from e.g. a cluster category to the associated cluster algebra is possible. In fact, we do much of the above in the setting of abstract quantum cluster structures, with some analysis of the difference between the category of these and that of the unquantized version. In order to show the relationship between abstract quantum cluster structures and quantum cluster algebras, we reformulate the usual construction of the latter in a way that is more amenable to our purposes and which we expect will be of independent interest and use.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this review, we present a general framework for the construction of Kac-Moody (KM) algebras associated to higher-dimensional manifolds. Starting from the classical case of loop algebras on the circle $\mathbb{S}^{1}$, we extend the approach to compact and non-compact group manifolds, coset spaces, and soft deformations thereof. After recalling the necessary geometric background on Riemannian manifolds, Hilbert bases and Killing vectors, we present the construction of generalized current algebras $\mathfrak{g}(\mathcal{M})$, their semidirect extensions with isometry algebras, and their central extensions. We show how the resulting algebras are controlled by the structure of the underlying manifold, and illustrate the framework through explicit realizations on $SU(2)$, $SU(2)/U(1)$, and higher-dimensional spheres, highlighting their relation to Virasoro-like algebras. We also discuss the compatibility conditions for cocycles, the role of harmonic analysis, and some applications in higher-dimensional field theory and supergravity compactifications. This provides a unifying perspective on KM algebras beyond one-dimensional settings, paving the way for further exploration of their mathematical and physical implications.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use the Tannakian formalism to define the Emerton--Gee stack for general groups. For a flat algebraic group G over Z_p, we are able to prove the associated Emerton--Gee stack is a formal algebraic stack locally of finite presentation over Spf(Z_p). We also define a derived stack of Laurent F-crystals with G-structure on the absolute prismatic site, whose underlying classical stack is proved to be equivalent to the Emerton--Gee stack. In the case of connected reductive groups, we show that the derived stack of Laurent F-crystals with G-structure is classical in the sense that when restricted to truncated animated rings, it is the \'etale sheafification of the left Kan extension of the Emerton--Gee stack along the inclusion from classical commutative rings to animated rings. Moreover, when G is a generalised reductive group, the classicality result still holds for a modified version of the Emerton--Gee stack. In particular, this completes the picture that the derived stack of local Langlands parameters for the Langlands dual group of a reductive group is classical.</p></details>

These results explain several known analogies and show that the Hausdorff dimension of sets defined by one expansion often coincides with that for another. The proofs rely on faithful families of coverings, for which we refine previously known estimates. In addition to deriving a range of known theorems as direct corollaries of previous results, our approach yields new fractal properties of the Engel and Pierce expansions and provides a systematic framework for transferring Hausdorff dimension properties between different expansions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By a theorem of Edrei, an infinite, normalised totally nonnegative upper-triangular Toeplitz matrices is determined by a pair of nonnegative parameter sequences, the `Schoenberg parameters', where nonzero parameters correspond to the roots and poles of a naturally associated generating function. These totally nonnegative Toeplitz matrices and their parameters also arise in the classification of characters of the infinite symmetric group by later work of Thoma. Moreover the Schoenberg parameters have an asymptotic interpretation in terms of irreducible representations of S_n and their Young diagrams by Vershik-Kerov. In this article we consider infinite totally positive Toeplitz matrices as limits of finite ones, and we obtain two further asymptotic descriptions of the Schoenberg parameters that are now related to quantum cohomology of the flag variety as n goes to infinity. One is related to asymptotics of normalised quantum parameters, and the other to asymptotics of the Chern classes of the tautological line bundles. We also describe the asymptotics of (quantum) Schubert classes in terms of the Schoenberg parameters. Our limit formulas relate to and were motivated by a tropical analogue of this theory that we survey. In the tropical setting one finds an asymptotic relationship between the `tropical Schoenberg parameters' and the weight map from Lusztig's parametrisation of the canonical basis.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any cluster-tilting object $\mathsf{T}$ in the cluster category $\mathscr{C}_{n}$ of type $\mathbb{A}_{n}$, we construct a rank-four oriented matroid $\mathcal{M}_{\mathsf{T}}$ such that stackable triangulations of $\mathcal{M}_{\mathsf{T}}$ are in bijection with equivalence classes of maximal green sequences with initial cluster $\mathsf{T}$. This generalises the result that equivalence classes of maximal green sequences of linearly oriented $\mathbb{A}_{n}$ are in bijection with triangulations of a three-dimensional cyclic polytope. The definition of the oriented matroid $\mathcal{M}_{\mathsf{T}}$ arises from the extriangulated structure on $\mathscr{C}_{n}$ which makes $\mathsf{T}$ projective.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is the second part of a series that intends to study the resolving subcategories for gentle algebras over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{K}$. As in the first part, we continue to focus on gentle quivers $(Q,R)$, where $Q$ is a directed tree, known as gentle trees. In our previous work, via a modified surface model for gentle algebras with finite global dimension, we studied the join-irreducible elements of the lattice of resolving subcategories of $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R \rangle - \text{mod}$, which happen to be those generated by a non-projective indecomposable object. In this paper, we notice that this lattice is not semidistributive in general and, accordingly, introduce a so-called upper join-decomposition, replacing the canonical one. Together with the techniques we develop in our geometric model, it allows us to describe the resolving subcategories of any gentle tree. These same techniques let us explicitly construct the resolving subcategory generated by any collection of indecomposable $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R\rangle$-modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is the first part of a series that intends to study the resolving subcategories for gentle algebras over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{K}$. In a general setting, we improve the precision of an algorithm from Takahashi for resolving closure calculations in well-behaved abelian categories. Then, we modify the geometric model of Baur--Coelho-Sim\~oes and Opper--Plamondon--Schroll to compute such subcategories for gentle quivers that have a finite global dimension. Finally, we focus on gentle quivers $(Q,R)$ such that $Q$ is a directed tree, and we study the monogeneous resolving subcategories, which are the ones generated by a single non-projective indecomposable $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R \rangle$-module. By the way, we prove that these subcategories are the join-irreducible elements of the poset of all the resolving subcategories ordered by inclusion.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1887, Minkowski determined the least common multiple of the orders of all finite subgroups of $GL_n(\mathbb{Q})$; we refer to this number as $M(n)$. In (Katznelson, 1994), Katznelson provides the asymptotic behaviour of $M(n)$, with a small error term. In this paper, we use elementary techniques to find explicit upper and lower bounds on $M(n)$ that improve on Katznelson's results; we also recover his asymptotic result. Our results immediately imply explicit bounds on functions closely related to $M(n)$, which appear in the study of abelian varieties (see, for example, (Silverberg, 1992), (Guralnick and Kedlaya, 2017) and (Ozeki, 2024)). Finally, we examine the function $\Phi(n)$, which also appears in (Ozeki, 2024), defined as the greatest positive integer $m$ for which $\varphi(m)$ divides $2n$. We provide explicit upper bounds on $\Phi(n)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{H}^{n-1}_{K}$ denote the $(n-1)$-dimensional Drinfeld space over a $p$-adic field $K$. We give an explicit description of the $\ell$-adic and $p$-adic pro-\'etale cohomology of quotient stacks $[\mathcal{H}^{n-1}_{K}/\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathcal{O}_K)]$ and $[\mathcal{H}^{n-1}_{K}/\mathrm{GL}_n(K)]$, which are moduli stacks of special formal $\mathcal{O}_D$-modules. The computation makes use of the isomorphism between the Lubin-Tate tower and the Drinfeld tower due to Faltings and Scholze--Weinstein, as well as the $p$-adic pro-\'etale cohomology of the Drinfeld spaces computed by Colmez--Dospinescu--Niziol. As an application, we also compute the continuous group cohomology of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ over duals of generalized Steinberg representations over $\mathbb{Q}_p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper initiates the study of invariants of links associated to infinite-dimensional representations of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ using graphical representation for quantum $6j$-symbols, the shadow world. We obtain formulae for $q3j$-symbols and $q6j$-symbols for Verma modules and study their properties. This hints at the structure of the possible target category for Reshetikhin-Turaev functor for such an invariant.</p></details>
