 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Vladimir Gurvich, Mariya Naumova &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A number $N$ is a triangular number if it can be written as $N = t(t + 1)/2$ for some nonnegative integer number $t$. A triangular number $N$ is called square if it is a perfect square, that is, $N = d^2$ for some integer number $d$. Square triangular numbers were characterized by Euler in 1778 and are in one-to-one correspondence with the so-called near-isosceles Pythagorean triples $(k,k+1,l)$, where $k^2 + (k+1)^2 = l^2$. A quadratic number is the product $Π= Π(k,j) = k(k+1)(k+j)(k+j+1)$ for some nonnegative integer numbers $k$ and $j$. By definition, it is the product of two triangular numbers and 4. Quadratic number $Π$ and the corresponding pair $(k,j)$ are called square if $Π$ is a perfect square. Clearly, $(k,j)$ is square if both triangular numbers $k(k+1)/2$ and $(k+j)(k+j+1)/2$ are perfect squares. Yet, there exist infinitely many other square quadratic numbers. We construct polynomials $j_i(k)$ of degree $i$ with positive integer coefficients satisfying equations: $k + j_{2 \ell}(k) + 1 = k [a_\ell k^\ell + \dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 +1 = (k+1) [b_\ell k^\ell + \dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ and \newline $k + j_{2\ell+1}(k) + 1 = k(k+1) [a_\ell k^\ell + \dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 + 1 = [b_{\ell+1} k^{\ell+1}+b_\ell k^\ell + \dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ for some positive integer $\ell$ and some coefficients $a_i, b_j$, $i=0, \ldots, \ell, j=0, \ldots, \ell+1$. All the obtained pairs $(k, j_i(k))$ are square. We conjecture that the products of square triangular numbers and pairs $(k, j_i(k))$ cover all quadratic squares. Additionally, we identify pairs of intervals of successive integers with equal sums of squares.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14860v2'>2508.14860</a>\]&nbsp; **Entropy of the Serre functor for partially wrapped Fukaya categories of surfaces with stops**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Wen Chang, Alexey Elagin, Sibylle Schroll &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** New version in which we merged the paper with the concurrent paper of Alexey Elagin on the same subject. Exposition and content changed, in particular, the paper now includes a section with explicit calculations of the entropy and the upper and lower Serre dimensions for many well-known examples of gentle algebras

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the entropy of the Serre functor $\mathbb{S}$ in the partially wrapped Fukaya category of a graded surface $Σ$ with stops is given by the function sending $t \in \mathbb{R}$ to $ h_t(\mathbb{S}) = (1-\min Ω)t$, for $t\geq 0$, and to $h_t(\mathbb{S})=(1-\max Ω)t$, for $t\leq 0$, where $Ω= \{\frac{ω_1}{m_1} \ldots, \frac{ω_b}{m_b},0\}$, and $ω_i$ is the winding number of the $i$th boundary component $\partial_iΣ$ of the surface with $b$ boundary components and $m_i$ stops on $\partial_i Σ$. It then follows that the upper and lower Serre dimensions are given by $1-\min Ω$ and $1-\max Ω$, respectively. Furthermore, in the case of a finite dimensional gentle algebra $A$, we show that a Gromov-Yomdin-like equality holds by relating the categorical entropy of the Serre functor of the perfect derived category of $A$ to the logarithm of the spectral radius of the Coxeter transformation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We discuss the local analysis of Gaussian potential energy of modular lattices. We present examples of $2$-modular lattices -- such as the $16$-dimensional Barnes-Wall lattice -- and $3$-modular lattices -- such as the $12$-dimensional Coxeter-Todd lattice -- that are locally universally optimal among lattices (in the sense of Cohn and Kumar). We also provide other $2$- and $3$-modular lattices that are not locally universally optimal, or not even critical in the Gaussian core model.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Taketo Sano &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 86 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by the $y$-ification of HOMFLY--PT homology by Gorsky and Hogancamp, and the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-action of Gorsky, Hogancamp, and Mellit, we construct $y$-ifications of Khovanov homology and its equivariant versions within Bar-Natan's framework for tangles, and define an action of the element $e$ in $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ on these $y$-ifications. We then prove that our construction is compatible with the previous ones under Rasmussen's spectral sequence from HOMFLY--PT homology to Khovanov homology. Our construction is elementary and well suited to diagrammatic manipulations and algorithmic implementations. As a result, we verify directly that these additional structures distinguish pairs of knots with identical Khovanov homology and HOMFLY--PT homology, in particular the Conway knot and the Kinoshita--Terasaka knot.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Abdelmalek Abdesselam, Shannon Starr &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.PR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for the number of joint orbits of random tuples of commuting permutations. In the uniform sampling case this generalizes the classic CLT of Goncharov for the number of cycles of a single random permutation. We also consider the case where tuples are weighted by a factor other than one, per joint orbit. We view this as an analogue of the Ewens measure, for tuples of commuting permutations, where our CLT generalizes the CLT by Hansen. Our proof uses saddle point analysis, in a context related to the Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotics and the theorem of Meinardus, but concerns a multiple pole situation. The proof is written in a self-contained manner, and hopefully in a manner accessible to a wider audience. We also indicate several open directions of further study related to probability, combinatorics, number theory, an elusive theory of random commuting matrices, and perhaps also geometric group theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages. Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give practical algorithms for computing the divisor class group and the gonality of a curve over a finite field, achieving several orders of magnitude speedup over existing methods for sufficiently large genus or residue field. The approach relies on introducing a precomputation step involving power series-expansions, which allows for an efficient amortized computation of large numbers of Riemann-Roch spaces.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Andrew MacArevey &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 7 pages. v2: Added the use of Corollary 2.1 to Theorem 3.1

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Lagarias inequality, an elementary criterion equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis. Using a continuous extension of the harmonic numbers, we show that the sequence $B_n=\frac{H_n+e^{H_n}\log(H_n)}{n}$ is strictly increasing for $n\ge 1$. As a consequence, if the Lagarias inequality has counterexamples, then the least counterexample must be a superabundant number; equivalently, it suffices to verify the inequality on the superabundant numbers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 36 pages, 11 figures, comments are very welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give an introduction to partially wrapped Fukaya categories of surfaces with orbifold singularities. Dissecting an orbifold surface $\mathbf S$ into polygons, certain dissections give rise to formal generators, inducing a triangulated equivalence between the derived Fukaya category of $\mathbf S$ and the perfect derived category of a graded associative algebra. This provides a geometric means for obtaining associative algebras -- conjecturally all -- which are derived equivalent to skew-gentle algebras. We include a new perspective on the partially wrapped Fukaya category of an orbifold disk which serves as a local model for the Fukaya categories of general orbifold surfaces. This perspective yields an equivalence between the perfect derived category of a quiver of type $\mathrm D_{n+1}$ and the perfect derived category of a graded quiver of type $\widetilde{\mathrm A}_{n-1}$, the latter being equipped with quadratic zero relations and a nontrivial A$_\infty$ structure. This equivalence elucidates the relationship between skew-gentle algebras and orbifold surfaces, and the role of deformation theory in this relationship.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Adam Skowyrski &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Following methods used by A. Dugas for investigating derived equivalent pairs of (weakly) symmetric algebras, we apply them in a specific situation, obtaining new deep results concerning iterated mutations of symmetric periodic algebras. More specifically, for any symmetric algebra $Λ$, and an arbitrary vertex $i$ of its Gabriel quiver, one can define mutation $μ_i(Λ)$ of $Λ$ at vertex $i$ via silting mutation of the stalk complex $\La$. Then $μ_i(Λ)$ is again symmetric, and we can iterate this process. We want to understand the order of $μ_i$, in case the vertex $i$ is $d$-periodic, i.e. the simple module $S_i$ associated to $i$ is periodic of period $d$ (with respect to the syzygy). The main result of this paper shows that then $μ_i$ has order $d-2$, that is $μ_i^{d-2}(Λ)\congΛ$ (modulo socle), under some additional assumption on the (periodic) projective-injective resolution of $S_i$. Besides, we present briefly some consequences concerning arbitrary periodic vertex and give few sugestive examples showing that this property should hold in general, i.e. without restrictions on the periodic projective resolution.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages, correction in references

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that any (n+1)-term silting complex whose intermediate cohomology vanishes gives rise to an n-silting module, as recently introduced by Mao. Specializing to commutative noetherian rings, we show that this assignment induces a bijection on the respective equivalence classes. Furthermore, we prove in the same setting that the n-silting modules always correspond to a tilting complex, that is, the associated t-structure is of derived type. We use this to exhibit new examples of tilting complexes in the setting of Commutative Algebra and also to show that the finite type property for n-silting modules, as formulated by Mao, can in general fail.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 10 pages, comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates the existence of a local-global principle for certain twists of abelian varieties defined over number fields. Our main focus is to determine when, for $m$ a positive integer, locally $m$-atic twists of an abelian variety $A$ over a number field $K$ are globally $m$-atic. We define and study a "Tate-Shafarevich cohomology set" that governs the obstruction to the local-global principle for $m$-atic twists. We prove that, under some mild assumptions, this set is finite, and give criteria for it to be trivial, i.e. for the local-global principle to be satisfied.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 154 pages,

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present the first algorithm for computing class groups and unit groups of arbitrary number fields that provably runs in probabilistic subexponential time, assuming the Extended Riemann Hypothesis (ERH). Previous subexponential algorithms were either restricted to imaginary quadratic fields, or relied on several heuristic assumptions that have long resisted rigorous analysis. The heart of our method is a new general strategy to provably solve a recurring computational problem in number theory (assuming ERH): given an ideal class $[\mathfrak{a}]$ of a number field $K$, sample an ideal $\mathfrak b \in [\mathfrak{a}]$ belonging to a particular family of ideals (e.g., the family of smooth ideals, or near-prime ideals). More precisely, let $\mathcal{S}$ be an arbitrary family of ideals, and $\mathcal{S}_B$ the family of $B$-smooth ideals. We describe an efficient algorithm that samples ideals $\mathfrak b \in [\mathfrak{a}]$ such that $\mathfrak b \in \mathcal{S} \cdot\mathcal{S}_B$ with probability proportional to the density of $\mathcal{S}$ within the set of all ideals. The case where $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of prime ideals yields the family $\mathcal{S}\cdot\mathcal{S}_B$ of near-prime ideals, of particular interest in that it constitutes a dense family of efficiently factorable ideals. The case of smooth ideals $\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{S}_B$ regularly comes up in index-calculus algorithms (notably to compute class groups and unit groups), where it has long constituted a theoretical obstacle overcome only by heuristic arguments.</p></details>

We also show that the proper class consisting of shod algebras is also closed under these operations. In addition, several classic classes of algebras -- including laura, glued, weakly shod algebras -- are proved to be closed under idempotent quotients, thereby generalizing a known result originally established for specific idempotents.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite VOA, not necessarily rational or self-dual. In this paper, we establish various versions of the sewing-factorization (SF) theorems for conformal blocks associated to grading-restricted generalized modules of $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$ (where $N\in\mathbb N$). In addition to the versions announced in the Introduction of [GZ23], we prove the following coend version of the SF theorem: Let $\mathfrak F$ be a compact Riemann surface with $N$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points, and let $\mathfrak G$ be another compact Riemann surface with $K$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points. Assign $\mathbb W\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes N})$ and $\mathbb X\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes K})$ to the incoming marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. For each $\mathbb{M} \in \mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes R})$, assign $\mathbb{M}$ and its contragredient $\mathbb M'$ to the outgoing marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. Denote the corresponding spaces of conformal blocks by $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb W)$ and $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak{G}}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes\mathbb X)$. Let the $\mathfrak X$ be the $(N+K)$-pointed surface obtained by sewing $\mathfrak F$, $\mathfrak G$ along their outgoing marked points. Then the sewing of conformal blocks-proved to be convergent in [GZ25a]-yields an isomorphism of vector spaces $$\int^{\mathbb{M}\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes R})}\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb{W})\otimes_{\mathbb C} \mathscr T_{\mathfrak G}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes \mathbb X)\simeq\mathscr T_{\mathfrak X}^*(\mathbb W\otimes \mathbb X)$$ We also discuss the relationship between conformal blocks and the modular functors defined using Lyubashenko's coend/construction.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Peter Reinhard Hansen, Chen Tong &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a unified integral framework based on the Fourier-Laplace transform evaluated along a vertical line in the complex plane. By identifying the moment-generating function (MGF) of a random variable with the weights of these integrals, we first establish a general expression for complex fractional moments valid for any random variable with a MGF. Applying this formula to the Gaussian distribution, we recover a global integral representation for the reciprocal Gamma function that unifies it with its reflection. We formalize the underlying operator as the Parabolic Mellin Transform, a holomorphic alternative to the classical Mellin transform that avoids strips of convergence by mapping the vertical line to a parabolic contour. This general framework leads to new meromorphic representations for the Hurwitz and Riemann zeta functions that are valid throughout the critical strip, as well as reformulations of the Riemann hypothesis and the Lindelof hypothesis.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop some foundations of commutative algebra, with a view towards algebraic geometry, in symmetric tensor categories. Most results establish analogues of classical theorems, in tensor categories which admit a tensor functor to some tensor category verifying specific conditions. This is in line with the current program which aims to describe tensor categories by their tensor functors to incompressible categories. We place particular emphasis on the notion of observable subgroups of affine group schemes in tensor categories, which in particular leads to some further insight into observability for classical affine group schemes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study skein modules of 3-manifolds by embedding them into the Hilbert spaces of 4d ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theories. When the 3-manifold has reduced holonomy, we present an algorithm to determine the dimension and the list of generators of the skein module with a general gauge group. The analysis uses a deformation preserving ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry to express the dimension as a sum over nilpotent orbits in its Lie algebra. We find that the dimensions often differ between Langlands-dual pairs beyond the A-series, for which we provide a physical explanation involving chiral symmetry breaking and 't Hooft operators. We also relate our results to the structure of $\mathbb{C}^*$-fixed loci in the moduli space of Higgs bundles. This approach helps to clarify the relation between the gauge-theoretic framework of Kapustin and Witten with other versions of the geometric Langlands program, explains why the dimensions of skein modules do not exhibit a TQFT-like behavior, and provides a physical interpretation of the skein-valued curve counting of Ekholm and Shende.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Perverse schobers are categorifications of perverse sheaves. In prior work we constructed a perverse schober on a partial compactification of the stringy Kähler moduli space (SKMS) associated by Halpern-Leistner and Sam to a quasi-symmetric representation of a reductive group. When the group is a torus the SKMS corresponds to the complement of the GKZ discriminant locus (which is a hyperplane arrangement in the quasi-symmetric case shown by Kite). We show here that a suitable variation of the perverse schober we constructed provides a categorification of the associated GKZ hypergeometric system in the case of non-resonant parameters. As an intermediate result we give a description of the monodromy of such "quasi-symmetric" GKZ hypergeometric systems.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This manuscript provides a substantial revision and a significant refocusing of the earlier preprint arXiv:2308.04284. The current version removes the applications to sequenceability to prioritize the development of anticoncentration inequalities in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and provides a more detailed comparison with the existing literature

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we investigate the probability distribution of the sum $Y$ of $\ell$ independent identically distributed random variables taking values in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Our main focus is the regime of small values of $\ell$, which is less explored compared to the asymptotic case $\ell \to \infty$. Starting with the case $\ell=3$, we prove that if the distributions of the $Y_i$ are uniformly bounded by $λ< 1$ and $p > 2/λ$, then there exists a constant $C_{3,λ} < 1$ such that $$ \max_{x \in \mathbb{Z}_p} \mathbb{P}[Y = x] \leq C_{3,λ}λ. $$ Moreover, when the distributions are uniformly separated from $1$, the constant $C_{3,λ}$ can be made explicit. By iterating this argument, we obtain effective anticoncentration bounds for larger values of $\ell$, yielding nontrivial estimates already in small and moderate regimes where asymptotic results do not apply.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by the question of defining a $p$-adic string worldsheet action in genus one, we define a Laplacian operator on the Tate curve, and study its Green's function. We show that the Green's function exists. We provide an explicit formula for the Green's function, which turns out to be a non-Archimedean counterpart of the Archimedean Green's function on a flat torus. In particular, it turns out that this Green's function recovers the Néron local height function for the Tate curve in the $p\to\infty$ limit, when the $j$-invariant has odd valuation. So this non-Archimedean height function now acquires a physics meaning in terms of the large $p$ limit of a non-Archimedean conformal field theory two point function on the Tate curve, as well as a direct analytic interpretation as a Green's function, on the same footing as in the Archimedean place.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Littlewood conjecture, proven by Konyagin and McGehee-Pigno-Smith in the 1980s, states that if $A\subset \mathbb{Z}$ is a finite set of integers with $\lvert A\rvert=N$ then $\| \widehat{1_A}\|_1\geq c\log N$ for some absolute constant $c > 0$. We explore what structure $A$ must have if $\| \widehat{1_A}\|_1\leq K\log N$ for some constant $K$. Under such an assumption we prove, for instance, that $A$ contains a subset $A'\subseteq A$ with $\lvert A\rvert \geq N^{0.99}$ such that $\lvert A'+A'\rvert \ll K^{O(1)}\lvert A'\rvert$. As a consequence, for any $k\geq 3$, if $N$ is sufficiently large depending on $k$ and $K$, then $A$ must contain an arithmetic progression of length $k$. A byproduct of our analysis is a (slightly) improved bound for the constant $c$.</p></details>

Secondly, we demonstrate that the maximal potentially abelian quotient of $G_λ$ is independent of $λ$ in a strong sense.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use Hensel minimality, a non-Archimedean analog of o-minimality, to study several questions around transcendental number theory, unlikely intersections, and differential fields in a non-Archimedean setting. In particular, we focus on $p$-adic exponentiation and Tate uniformization on $\mathbb{C}_p$, which we show live in a Hensel minimal structure on $\mathbb{C}_p$. We start by constructing a large collection of derivations on Hensel minimal fields that respect definable functions, which we then apply to the $p$-adic Schanuel conjecture. We also study properties of local definability in analogy to work of Wilkie, and show that $p$-adic Schanuel implies a uniform version of itself. For Tate uniformization we show a strong closure property when blurring, and deduce that $\mathbb{C}_p$ with the blurred Tate uniformization is quasiminimal. Finally, we prove a result on $p$-adic density of likely intersections for powers of elliptic curves.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The celebrated Harish-Chandra's integrability theorem states that the distributional character of an irreducible smooth representation of a p-adic group $G(F)$ is integrable, that is represented by an $L^1_{loc}(G(F))$ function. Here $F$ is a non-Archimedean local field of characteristic $0$ and $G$ is a reductive algebraic group defined over $F$. In this paper we focus on cuspidal representations of $GL_n(F)$ for a field $F$ of positive characteristic.

> **Comment:** 50p

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove dimension bounds on the jet schemes of the variety of nilpotent matrices (and of related varieties) in positive characteristic. This result has applications to the analytic properties of the Chevalley map that sends a matrix to its characteristic polynomial. We show that our dimension bound implies, under the assumption of existence of resolution of singularities in positive characteristic, that the Chevalley map pushes a smooth compactly supported measure to a measure whose density function is $L^t$ for any $t<\infty$. We also prove this analytic property of the Chevalley map, unconditionally, when the characteristic of the field exceeds $n/2$. The zero characteristic counterpart of this result is an important step in the proof of the celebrated Harish-Chandra's integrability theorem. In a sequel work [AGKSb], we show that also in positive characteristic, this analytic statement implies Harish-Chandra's integrability theorem for cuspidal representations of the general linear group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As a natural sequel to the study of A-motivic cohomology initiated in "On the integral part of A-motivic cohomology", we develop a notion of regulator for rigid analytically trivial Anderson A-motives. In accordance with the conjectural picture over number fields, we define it as the morphism at the level of extension modules induced by the exactness of the Hodge-Pink realization functor. The purpose of this article is twofold: first, we prove a finiteness result for A-motivic cohomology; second, under a weight assumption, we show that the source and the target of the regulator have the same dimension. It came as a surprise to the author that the image of this regulator may fail to have full rank, thereby preventing an analogue of Beilinson's celebrated conjecture from holding in our setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $ψ$ be a continuous decreasing function defined on all large positive real numbers. We say that a real $m\times n$ matrix $A$ is $ψ$-Dirichlet if for every sufficiently large real number $t$ one can find $\mathbf{p} \in \mathbb{Z}^m$, $\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{Z}^n\setminus\{\mathbf{0}\}$ satisfying $\|A\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{p}\|^m< ψ(t)$ and $\|\mathbf{q}\|^n<t$. By removing a technical condition from a partial zero-one law proved by Kleinbock-Strömbergsson-Yu, we prove a zero-one law for the Lebesgue measure of the set of $ψ$-Dirichlet matrices provided that $ψ(t)<1/t$ and $tψ(t)$ is increasing. In fact, we prove the zero-one law in a more general situation with the monotonicity assumption on $tψ(t)$ replaced by a weaker condition. Our proof follows the dynamical approach of Kleinbock-Strömbergsson-Yu in reducing the question to a shrinking target problem in the space of lattices. The key new ingredient is a family of carefully chosen subsets of the shrinking targets studied by Kleinbock-Strömbergsson-Yu, together with a short-range mixing estimate for the associated hitting events. Our method also works for the analogous weighted problem where the relevant supremum norms are replaced by certain weighted quasi-norms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k\geq2$ be an integer. The aim of this paper is to investigate the distribution of $k$-full integers between three successive $k$-th powers. More precisely, for any integers $\ell,m\ge0$, we establish the explicit asymptotic density for the set of integers $n$ such that the intervals $(n^k, (n+1)^k)$ and $((n+1)^k, (n+2)^k)$ contain exactly $\ell$ and $m$ $k$-full integers, respectively. As an application, we prove that there are infinitely many triples of successive $k$-th powers in the sequence of $k$-full integers, thereby providing a more general answer to Shiu's question.</p></details>

Our approach is based on a quantum modularity of generalized Dedekind sums associated with general modular forms. In the case of Eisenstein series for $ Γ(N) $, these generalized Dedekind sums admit trigonometric sum expressions, which coincide with the formula for the $ \mathrm{SU}(2) $-TQFT signature. Furthermore, we express both the $ \mathrm{SU}(2) $-TQFT and generalized Dedekind sums as radial limits of Eichler integrals.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove conjectures of Zamolodchikov and Belavin-Belavin in Liouville conformal field theory (CFT), which are generalisations of the celebrated Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov equations known as the higher equations of motion. Algebraically, these equations give examples of non-zero singular states in Virasoro modules, which is a relatively rare phenomenon in the physical study of CFT. In probability theory, these equations and their variants have been instrumental in the rigorous derivation of the structure constants of Liouville CFT in the unit disc. The proof builds on a previous work of ours studying the analytic continuation of the Poisson operator of Liouville theory. The main novelty is that this operator admits poles on the Kac table, and the higher equations of motions are obtained via a residue computation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For fixed positive integers $n,m$, let $\mathrm{Mat}_{n\times m}(\mathbb{C})$ be the affine space consisting of all $n\times m$ complex matrices, and let $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n\times m}]$ be its coordinate ring. For $0\le r\le\min\{m,n\}$, we apply the orbit harmonics method to the finite matrix loci $\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r}$ of rook placements with exactly $r$ rooks, yielding a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n\times\mathfrak{S}_m$-module $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We find one signed and two sign-free graded character formulae for $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We also exhibit some applications of these formulae, such as proving a concise presentation of $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$, and proving some module injections and isomorphisms. Some of our techniques are still valid for involution matrix loci.</p></details>

We first prove in any characteristics that Fourier-Mukai partners of abelian varieties are again abelian varieties. We subsequently focus on the canonical lifts of ordinary abelian varieties and ordinary K3 surfaces. For such schemes, we show that Fourier-Mukai equivalences on the special fibers can be lifted to the canonical lifts. We also prove that the relative Fourier-Mukai partners of the canonical lifts are in bijection with the Fourier-Mukai partners of the special fibers. We conclude by demonstrating that the last result can be used to recover the ordinary case of a result originally proved by Honigs, Lombardi and Tirabassi.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study constraints imposed by four-dimensional unitarity (formalised as graded unitarity in recent work by the first author) on possible ${\mathcal W}_3$ vertex algebras arising from four-dimensions via the SCFT/VOA correspondence. Under the assumption that the $\mathfrak{R}$-filtration is a weight-based filtration with respect to the usual strong generators of the vertex algebra, we demonstrate that all values of the central charge other than those of the $(3,q+4)$ minimal models are incompatible with four-dimensional unitarity. These algebras are precisely the ones that are realised by performing principal Drinfel'd--Sokolov reduction to boundary-admissible $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ affine current algebras; those affine algebras were singled out by a similar graded unitarity analysis in \cite{ArabiArdehali:2025fad}. Furthermore, these particular vertex algebras are known to be associated with the $(A_2,A_q)$ Argyres--Douglas theories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We interpret the structure of the adele class space of the rationals--and specifically its Riemann sector--as the natural monoidal extension of the Picard group of the arithmetic curve $\overline{\mathrm{Spec} \mathbb Z}$. We identify the elements of this space with torsion-free rank-1 abelian groups $L$ endowed with rigidifying data. In the Riemann sector, this data corresponds to a norm, extending the classical notion of metrized line bundles in Arakelov geometry. For the full adele class space, we replace the norm with a group morphism to $\mathbb R$ and a combinatorial datum: a parametrization of the roots of unity associated with the character dual of $L$. We show that the product of adeles is represented geometrically by the tensor product of these rank-1 groups and their rigidifying structures. The resulting monoid space generalizes the Picard group to the full adelic context by incorporating the singular strata required for the spectral realization of $L$-functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the lattice $\mathbf{tors}(A)$ of torsion pairs in the category $\mathrm{mod}(A)$ of finitely generated modules over an artinian ring $A$. It was shown by the authors in previous work that $\mathbf{tors}(A)$ is isomorphic to a lattice formed by certain closed sets, called maximal rigid, in the Ziegler spectrum of the unbounded derived category $\mathrm{D}(A)$ of $A$. Moreover, the structure of this lattice is described by an operation on maximal rigid sets which encompasses (the dual of) silting mutation. In this paper we provide an explicit description of this operation and we discuss how it is reflected in the lattice $\mathbf{tors}(A)$. We establish a bijection between the wide intervals in $\mathbf{tors}(A)$ and the closed rigid sets in the Ziegler spectrum of $\mathrm{D}(A)$. Moreover, we show that the arrows in the Hasse quiver of $\mathbf{tors}(A)$ correspond to the closed rigid sets that are almost complete, or equivalently, that can be completed to a maximal rigid set in exactly two ways. Our results are most interesting in the case when $A$ is a finite dimensional algebra. In fact, we generalise results by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten, with an important difference: not every point in a maximal rigid set is mutable. We use the topology on the Ziegler spectrum to determine the mutable points. In the last section of the paper we illustrate our results by the example of a finite dimensional algebra arising from a triangulation of an annulus.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is devoted to the theory of $GL_n({\mathbb Z})$-conjugacy classes of regular integer $n\times n$ matrices. Such a matrix is $GL_n({\mathbb Q})$-conjugate to the companion matrix of its characteristic polynomial. But the set of $GL_n({\mathbb Z})$-conjugacy classes of regular integer matrices with a fixed characteristic polynomial $f$ is usually nontrivial (finite if $f$ has simple roots, infinite if $f$ has multiple roots). It is in 1:1-correspondence to a subsemigroup of a certain quotient semigroup of the commutative semigroup of full lattices in the algebra ${\mathbb Q}[t]/(f)$. In its first part, the paper gives a survey on old and new results on full lattices and orders in a finite dimensional commutative ${\mathbb Q}$-algebra with unit element and on induced semigroups. In its longer second part, the paper applies this theory to many examples, essentially all cases with $n=2$, many cases with $n=3$ and two cases with arbitrary $n$, the case with $n$ different integer eigenvalues and the case of a single $n\times n$ Jordan block.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a stability theory for minimal projective resolutions of $\mathbf{P}$-modules, where $\mathbf{P}$ is a finite metric poset. On the module side, we introduce the \emph{Galois transport distance}, defined by factoring two modules through a common ``apex'' poset via pairs of Galois insertions and measuring the maximal displacement in the index poset. This construction generalizes the interleaving distance in both the classical one-parameter and multiparameter settings, and yields an extended metric on isomorphism classes of $\mathbf{P}$-modules. On the homological side, we define a bottleneck distance between minimal projective resolutions by matching indecomposable projectives degreewise, with contractible cones playing the role of diagonal terms. Our main theorem shows that this resolution-level bottleneck distance is always bounded above by the Galois transport distance, providing a metric stability result formulated entirely at the level of modules and their minimal projective resolutions. We then treat persistence as an application. Passing to the interval poset and a kernel construction, we interpret persistence diagrams as minimal projective resolutions of kernel modules and obtain a corresponding stability inequality. In the one-parameter case this recovers classical bottleneck stability, while in the multiparameter setting it extends naturally to signed diagrams arising from minimal projective resolutions. Via a general relationship between minimal projective resolutions and Möbius inversion, these results can be interpreted as a stability theorem for Möbius homology, while remaining entirely phrased in the language of projective resolutions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f(x) = (x^{2}+1)^{n} - a x^{n} \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ and assume $f(x)$ is irreducible. Let $θ$ be a root of $f(x)$, set $K= \mathbb{Q}(θ)$, and denote by $\mathbb{Z}_{K}$ the ring of integers of $K$. The index of $f$, denoted $\mathrm{ind}(f)$, is the index of $\mathbb{Z}[θ]$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{K}$. A polynomial $f(x)$ is said to be monogenic if $\mathrm{ind}(f) = 1$. In this article, we explicitly compute the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$, and then derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the parameters $a$ and $n$ for $f(x)$ to be monogenic. Furthermore, we provide a complete description of the primes that divide $\mathrm{ind}(f)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We continue generalizing Altuğ's work on $\mathsf{GL}_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ in the unramified setting for \emph{Beyond Endoscopy} to the ramified case where ramification occurs at $S=\{\infty,q_1,\dots,q_r\}$ with $2\in S$, after generalizing the first step. We establish a new proof of the $1/4$ bound towards the Ramanujan conjecture for the trace of the cuspidal part in the ramified case, which is also provided by adapting Altuğ's original approach. The proof proceeds in three stages: First, we estimate the contributions from the non-elliptic parts of the trace formula. Then, we apply the main result from our the previous work to isolate the $1$-dimensional representations within the elliptic part. Finally, we employ technical analytic estimates to bound the remainder terms in the elliptic part.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates the construction of space-filling designs for computer experiments. The space-filling property is characterized by the covering and separation radii of a design, which are integrated through the unified criterion of quasi-uniformity. We focus on a special class of designs, known as quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) lattice point sets, and propose two construction algorithms. The first algorithm generates rank-1 lattice point sets as an approximation of quasi-uniform Kronecker sequences, where the generating vector is determined explicitly. As a byproduct of our analysis, we prove that this explicit point set achieves an isotropic discrepancy of $O(N^{-1/d})$. The second algorithm utilizes Korobov lattice point sets, employing the Lenstra--Lenstra--Lovász (LLL) basis reduction algorithm to identify the generating vector that ensures quasi-uniformity. Numerical experiments are provided to validate our theoretical claims regarding quasi-uniformity. Furthermore, we conduct empirical comparisons between various QMC point sets in the context of Gaussian process regression, showcasing the efficacy of the proposed designs for computer experiments.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In [GL24], Galashin and Lam discovered that when $k$ and $n$ are coprime, the proportion of subspaces in $\mathrm{Gr}(k,n)(\mathbb{F}_q)$ that lie in the top-dimensional open positroid variety $Π_{k,n}^\circ(\mathbb{F}_q)$ is $|(\mathbb{F}_q^\times)^n|/|\mathbb{F}_{q^n}^\times|$. In this paper, I recover this point count identity by relating the split torus action on $(Π_{k,n}^\circ)_{\mathbb{F}_q}$ and an anisotropic torus action on a $\mathbb{F}_q$ rational form of $Π_{k,n}^\circ$. The main step in the point count argument and the main technical result in this paper is that cyclic rotation acts trivially on the torus-equivariant cohomology of $Π_{k,n}^\circ$ when $k$ and $n$ are coprime.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Theorems about reductive groups and applications concerning cohomology and the associated local systems are added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study finite-rank left-translation invariant algebraic $D$-modules on complex affine algebraic groups. Using the standard description of these objects as left-invariant flat algebraic connections on the trivial vector bundle, modulo algebraic gauge transformations, we recast the classification problem as an explicit moduli problem for constant connections. We prove our main results for semisimple groups, for general linear groups, and more generally for connected reductive groups. For a connected semisimple complex algebraic group, invariant $D$-modules are classified by representations of the finite central kernel of the simply connected cover. For a general linear group, every invariant $D$-module is obtained by pullback along the determinant map, reducing the classification to the one-dimensional torus case. For a connected reductive group, we relate invariant $D$-modules via pullback along the abelianization map. We also derive applications concerning cohomology and the associated local systems for semisimple groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study congruences modulo powers of a prime $p$ between pairs of $p$-new modular Hecke eigenforms of level $Γ_0(p)$ and same weight $k$. Based on explicit computations, we conjecture that every such eigenform $f$ admits a twin to which it is congruent modulo a surprisingly high power of $p$, whose exponent is close to the opposite of the valuation of the $\mathcal L$-invariant of $f$, and whose Atkin--Lehner sign is opposite to that of $f$. This is a new phenomenon that is not explained by the known results on the $p$-adic variation of eigenforms. Inspired by the global picture, we formulate a local conjecture describing congruences between semistable representations of fixed weight, varying $\mathcal L$-invariant, and opposite Atkin--Lehner signs.

> **Comment:** 27 pages. No figures. Part of a six-paper series on Algebraic Phase Theory

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop the representation theory intrinsic to Algebraic Phase Theory (APT) in regimes where defect and canonical filtration admit faithful algebraic realisation. This extends the framework introduced in earlier work by incorporating a representation-theoretic layer that is compatible with defect and filtration. In this setting, algebraic phases act naturally on filtered module categories rather than on isolated objects, and classical irreducibility must be replaced by a filtration-compatible notion of indecomposability forced by defect. As a central application, we analyse the Frobenius Heisenberg algebraic phase, which occupies a rigid boundary regime within the broader APT landscape, and show that it satisfies the axioms of APT in a strongly admissible form. We study the representations realising this phase and show that their non-semisimplicity and rigidity properties are consequences of the underlying algebraic structure rather than analytic or semisimple hypotheses. In particular, we establish a Stone von Neumann type rigidity theorem for Heisenberg groups associated with finite Frobenius rings. For each such ring $R$, we construct a canonical Schrödinger representation of the Frobenius Heisenberg group $H_R$, and show that, for a fixed nontrivial central character, every centrally faithful representation of $H_R$ is equivalent to this model. The proof is entirely algebraic and uses no topology, unitarity, Fourier analysis, or semisimplicity. Instead, rigidity emerges as a boundary phenomenon governed by defect and canonical filtration. The Frobenius hypothesis is shown to be sharp: it precisely delineates the structural boundary within APT at which Heisenberg rigidity persists, and outside the Frobenius class this rigidity necessarily fails.</p></details>

It studies the commutative semigroup of full lattices in such an algebra and also the quotient semigroup. This leads in this commutative, but not separable situation to a certain extension of the Jordan-Zassenhaus theorem.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite-dimensional algebra $Λ$ over an algebraically closed field $K$, it is known that the poset of $2$-term silting objects in $\mathrm{K}^b(\mathrm{proj}Λ)$ is isomorphic to the poset of functorially finite torsion classes in $\mathrm{mod}Λ$, and to that of complete cotorsion classes in $\mathrm{K}^{[-1,0]}(\mathrm{proj}Λ)$. In this work, we generalise this result to the case of $d$-term silting objects for arbitrary $d\geq 2$ by introducing the notion of torsion classes for extriangulated categories. In particular, we show that the poset of $d$-term silting objects in $\mathrm{K}^b(\mathrm{proj}Λ)$ is isomorphic to the poset of complete and hereditary cotorsion classes in $\mathrm{K}^{[-d+1,0]}(\mathrm{proj}Λ)$, and to that of positive and functorially finite torsion classes in $D^{[-d+2,0]}(\mathrm{mod}Λ)$, an extension-closed subcategory of $D^b(\mathrm{mod}Λ)$. We further show that the posets $\mathrm{cotors}\mathrm{K}^{[-d+1,0]}(\mathrm{proj}Λ)$ and $\mathrm{tors} D^{[-d+2,0]}(\mathrm{mod}Λ)$ are lattices, and that the truncation functor $τ_{\geq -d+2}$ gives an isomorphism between the two.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $U$ be a maximal unipotent subgroup in a symplectic group over a finite field of sufficiently large characteristic $p$. According to the Kirillov's orbit method, the coadjoint orbits of the group $U$ play the key role in the description of irreducible complex characters of $U$. Almost all important classes of orbits and characters studied to the moment can be uniformly described as the orbits and characters associated with so-called orthogonal rook placements. In the paper, we construct a semi-direct decomposition for the corresponding irreducible characters in the spirit of the Mackey little group method. As a corollary, we present an explicit formula for the character corresponding to an orbit of maximal possible dimension.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a geometric theta correspondence from the first homology of a modular curve, to modular forms of weight $2$. Using Stevens' description of the homology, we find that this map sends modular symbols to product of weight one Eisenstein series, modular caps to weight $2$ Eisenstein series, and hyperbolic cycles to diagonal restrictions of Hilbert-Eisenstein series. We use it to revisit work of Borisov and Gunnells, and explain its connection to a theorem of Li. In particular, we give a geometric proof of certain relations between Eisenstein series.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We will attach a scalar invariant to a tetrahedron whose edges are labelled by irreducible representations of a ternary orthogonal group $\mathrm{SO}_3$ over a local field. This generalizes the $6j$ symbol whose theory was developed by Racah, Wigner, and Regge. We give several formulas for this invariant, including in terms of hypergeometric-type integrals and functions, and show that it admits a symmetry by the the $23040$-element Weyl group of $\mathrm{Spin}_{12}$. We then interpret these results in terms of relative Langlands duality, where the dual story comes from the action of $\mathrm{Spin}_{12}$ on a $16$-dimensional cone of spinors.</p></details>
