 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-27 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zach Hunter, Cosmin Pohoata, Jacques Verstraete, Shengtong Zhang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any integer $d \geq 2$ and prime power $q$, we construct unexpectedly large induced matchings in the point-line incidence graph of $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{d}$ by leveraging a new connection with the Furstenberg-Sárközy problem from arithmetic combinatorics. In particular, we significantly improve the previously well-known baselines when $q$ is prime, showing that $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}$ contains matchings of size $q^{1.233}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{d}$ contains matchings of size $q^{d-o_{d}(1)}$. These results and their proofs have several applications. First, we also obtain new constructions for finite field Nikodym sets in dimension $d \geq 2$, improving recent results of Tao by polynomial factors. For example, when $q$ is prime, we show the existence of Nikodym sets in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$ of size $q^d - q^{d - o_d(1)}$. Second, we construct a new minimal blocking set in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$, solving a longstanding problem in finite geometry. Third, we obtain new constructions for the minimal distance problem (in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and also in higher dimensions), improving a recent result of Logunov-Zakharov. We also obtain analogous results for general finite fields with large characteristics. In particular, in one of our constructions we introduce a new special set of points inside the norm hypersurface in $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{d}$, which directly generalizes the classical Hermitian unital and which may be of independent interest for applications.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-27 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Matt Broe &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 42 pages. Restructured some proofs to work over a higher-dimensional base. Also updated exposition and fixed minor typos. Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a field and $X$ a smooth projective variety over $k$. When $k$ is a number field, the Beilinson-Bloch conjecture relates the ranks of the Chow groups of $X$ to the order of vanishing of certain $L$-functions. We consider the same conjecture when $k$ is a global function field, and give a criterion for the conjecture to hold for $X$, extending an earlier result of Jannsen. As an application, we provide a new proof of a theorem of Geisser connecting the Tate conjecture over finite fields and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture over function fields. We then prove the Tate conjecture for a product of a smooth projective curve with a power of a CM elliptic curve over any finitely generated field, and thus deduce special cases of the Beilinson--Bloch conjecture. In the process we obtain a conditional answer to a question of Moonen on the Chow groups of powers of ordinary CM elliptic curves over arbitrary fields.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-27 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ben Forrás &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 12 pages. Rewritten version of §7 of arXiv:2403.04663v3 reorganised into a separate manuscript

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal G\simeq H\rtimesΓ$ be the semidirect product of a finite group $H$ and $Γ\simeq\mathbb Z_p$. Let $ F/\mathbb Q_p$ be a finite extension with ring of integers $\mathcal O_F$. Then the total ring of quotients $\mathcal Q^F(\mathcal G)$ of the completed group ring $\mathcal O_F[[\mathcal G]]$ is semisimple artinian. We determine its Wedderburn decomposition in full generality in terms of the Wedderburn decomposition of the group ring $ F[H]$. Such a description was previously available only for those simple components for which a certain associated field extension is totally ramified.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02774v2'>2511.02774</a>\]&nbsp; **Real zeros of $L'(s, χ_d)$**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-27 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Youness Lamzouri, Kunjakanan Nath &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Major revision. We considerably strengthen the main results and in particular, we now resolve the Baker-Montgomery conjecture unconditionally (up to a $\log\log\log x$ factor). The proof introduces new ideas, and the structure and exposition have been reorganised accordingly. 30 pages, 2 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1990, Baker and Montgomery conjectured that $L'(s,χ_d)$ has $\asymp \log\log |d|$ real zeros in the interval $[1/2,1]$ for almost all fundamental discriminants $d$. The study of these zeros was motivated by their connection to real zeros of Fekete polynomials and to sign changes of the character sums $\sum_{n\leq x}χ_d(n)$. Recent work of Klurman, Lamzouri, and Munsch shows that the number of such zeros is $\gg (\log\log |d|)/(\log\log\log\log |d|)$ for almost all $d$, thereby establishing the conjectured lower bound up to the factor $\log\log\log\log |d|$. In this paper, we prove that for almost all fundamental discriminants $d$, $L'(s,χ_d)$ has at most $(\log\log |d|)(\log\log\log |d|)$ real zeros in $[1/2,1]$, thus resolving the Baker-Montgomery conjecture up to a factor of $\log\log\log |d|$. We also give a quantitative upper bound on the exceptional set of discriminants. Furthermore, we show, conditionally on certain natural assumptions, that $100\%$ of these zeros lie away from $1/2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that for $k\ge 1$, all coefficients in the expansion of the series $$\sum_{n\ge 0} \frac{(q^{2n+2}, q^{2n+2k}; q^2)_\infty}{(q^{2n+1};q^2)_\infty^2} q^{2n}$$ are positive, by $q$-hypergeometric means.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-27 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Bowman Hall &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a computational study of 200 composite integers of approximately 350 bits, engineered using the Arnault framework to pass all Miller-Rabin tests up to base 11. Generated at a rate of approximately 20 per hour from a high-throughput construction process producing ~7,700 Carmichael numbers per minute, all samples fail the strong Lucas probable prime test. We introduce the U-bit collapse metric delta = log_2(n) - log_2(U_d mod n) to quantify deviation from the expected uniform distribution of Lucas sequence terms. Analysis reveals minimal collapse values: mean delta = 1.61 bits, median delta = 1.0 bits, maximum delta = 8 bits, with 26% showing no measurable collapse. We analyze correlations with prime residue classes modulo 35, Arnault construction parameters (k,M), and composite bit-sizes. Our results demonstrate that composites engineered for Miller-Rabin resistance exhibit negligible Lucas sequence degeneracy, providing strong empirical evidence for the statistical independence of these two primality test components and supporting the continued robustness of Baillie-PSW-type tests.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the tail of the sets $$\mathbf S_x := \big\{\left\lfloor x^n\right\rfloor : n\in \mathbb N\big\}$$ are Sidon for almost all $x\in (1,2)$. Then we prove that for all $\varepsilon>0$, there exists $x\in (1,\, 1+\varepsilon)$ and $r\in (2-\varepsilon,\, 2)$ such that $\mathbf S_x$ and $\mathbf S_r$ have a Sidon tail.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Published in Analele ştiinţifice ale Universităţii "Ovidius" Constanţa. Seria Matematică (2021), see DOI

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The aim of this paper is to consider the extensibility of the Diophantine triple $\{2,b,c\}$, where $2<b<c$, and to prove that such a set cannot be extended to an irregular Diophantine quadruple. We succeed in that for some families of $c$'s (depending on $b$). As corollary, for example, we prove that for $b/2-1$ prime, all Diophantine quadruples $\{2,b,c,d\}$ with $2<b<c<d$ are regular.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 30 pages; v2: version to be included in the author's Ph.D. thesis

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The focus of this article is on metric completions of triangulated categories arising in the representation theory of hereditary finite dimensional algebras and commutative rings. We explicitly describe all completions of bounded derived categories with respect to additive good metrics for two classes of rings - hereditary commutative noetherian rings and hereditary algebras of tame representation type over an algebraically closed field. To that end, we develop and study the lattice theory of metrics on triangulated categories. Moreover, we establish a link between metric completions of bounded derived categories of a ring and the ring's universal localisations.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 46 pages, 1 figure, 24 tables. Data and source code are available at https://olitb.net/pro/uni29/

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We classify the unimodular Euclidean integral lattices of rank 29 by developing an elementary, yet very efficient, inductive method. As an application, we determine the isometry classes of even lattices of rank at most 28 and prime (half-)determinant at most 7. We also provide new isometry invariants allowing for independent verification of the completeness of our lists, and we give conceptual explanations of some unique orbit phenomena discovered during our computations. Some of the genera classified here are orders of magnitude larger than any genus previously classified. In a forthcoming companion paper, we use these computations to study the cohomology of GL_n(Z).</p></details>

> **Comment:** 57 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms of cluster algebras and show that their induced action on the g-vectors can be realized by tropicalising their action on the homogeneous $\hat{y}$ (or $\mathcal{X}$) variables of a chosen initial cluster. This perspective allows us to interpret the action on g-vectors as a change of coordinates in the tropical setting. Focusing on Grassmannian cluster algebras, we analyse tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms in detail. We derive tropical analogues of the braid group action and the twist map on both g-vectors and tableaux. We introduce the notions of unstable and stable fixed points for quasi-automorphisms, which prove useful for constructing cluster monomials and non-real modules, respectively. As an application, we demonstrate that the counts of prime non-real tableaux with a fixed number of columns in $\mathrm{SSYT}(3, [9])$ and $\mathrm{SSYT}(4, [8])$, arising from the braid group action on stable fixed points, are governed by Euler's totient function. Furthermore, we apply our findings to scattering amplitudes in physics, providing a novel interpretation of the square root associated with the four-mass box integral via stable fixed points of quasi-automorphisms of the Grassmannian cluster algebra $\CC[\Gr(4,8)]$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-27 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Priyamvad Srivastav &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 32 pages, minor corrections, pdf of ancillary file included

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish completely log-free bounds for exponential sums over the primes and the Möbius function. Let $0<η\leq 1/10$, and suppose $α= a/q + δ/x$, with $(a,q)=1$ and $|δ| \leq x^{1/5 + η}/q$, and set $δ_0 = \max(1, |δ|/4)$. For $x \geq x_0(η)$ sufficiently large, we show that: \begin{equation*} \Biggl| \sum_{n \leq x} Λ(n) e(nα) \Biggr| \leq \frac{q}{\varphi(q)} \frac{\mathscr{F}_η\bigl( \frac{\log δ_0 q}{\log x}, \frac{\log^+ δ_0/q}{\log x} \bigr) \cdot x }{\sqrt{δ_0 q}} \ \text{ and } \ \Biggl| \sum_{n \leq x} μ(n) e(nα) \Biggr| \leq \frac{\mathscr{G}_η\bigl( \frac{\log δ_0 q}{\log x}, \frac{\log^+ δ_0/q}{\log x} \bigr) \cdot x}{\sqrt{δ_0 \varphi(q)}}, \end{equation*} for all $1 \leq q \leq x^{2/5 - η}$, where $\log^+ z = \max(\log z, 0)$, and the functions $\mathscr{F}_η$ and $\mathscr{G}_η$ are explicitly determined, taking small to moderate values. These bounds improve substantially upon the existing results - particularly with respect to the permissible ranges of $q$, $δ$ in which log-free bounds are known to hold and potentially with respect to asymptotic functions $\mathscr{F}_η$ and $\mathscr{G}_η$ as well. Moreover, the range $1 \leq q \leq x^{2/5 - η}$ is essentially the best possible we can expect. The main innovation is a sieve-weighted version of Vaughan's identity (Lemma 2.1), which is effectively log-free. We employ several ideas and results from the pioneering work of Helfgott, and particularly, they play a central role in ensuring the log-freeness of the type-I contribution. Also, like in his work, these bounds improve as $δ$ increases.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 33 pages. Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a framework of monoidal categorification of finite type cluster algebras involving triangulated monoidal categories. Namely, given a Dynkin quiver $Q$, we consider the bounded homotopy category $\mathcal{K}_Q^{(1)}$ of a symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{H}_Q^{(1)}$ that we define in terms of the Auslander-Reiten theory of $Q$. Using some iterated mapping cone procedure, we construct a distinguished family $\{ C_{\bullet}[β] \}_{β\in Δ_+}$ of chain complexes in $\mathcal{K}_Q^{(1)}$ characterized (up to isomorphism) by homological conditions similar to those of higher exact sequences appearing in the context of higher homological algebra. We then prove that the distinguished triangle in $\mathcal{K}_Q^{(1)}$ given by each mapping cone categorifies an exchange relation in the finite type cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}_Q$ with initial exchange quiver $Q$ (for a suitable choice of frozen variables). As a consequence, we obtain that for each positive root $β$, the Euler characteristic of $C_{\bullet}[β]$ coincides with the truncated $q$-character of the simple module $L[β]$ in the HL category $\mathcal{C}_ξ^{(1)}$ categorifying the cluster variable $x[β]$ of $\mathcal{A}_Q$ via Hernandez-Leclerc's monoidal categorification. Along the way, we establish a uniform formula for the dominant monomial of $L[β]$ in all types $A_n$ and $D_n$ for arbitrary orientations (agreeing with Brito-Chari's results in type $A_n$).</p></details>

> **Comment:** 30 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider Iwahori-Coulomb branches $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N},\mathbf{V}}^{\mathrm{Fl}}$, which are the affine flag analogs of the original Coulomb branches $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^{\mathrm{Gr}}$ defined by Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima. For any conical symplectic resolution $X$, we prove that the $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N},\mathbf{V}}^{\mathrm{Fl}}$-action on the localized equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$, induced by shift operators, satisfies a polynomiality property in terms of stable envelopes. We then study the case $X = T^*(G/P)$, the cotangent bundle of a flag variety, for which the Iwahori-Coulomb branch is isomorphic to the trigonometric double affine Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}_{G,\hbar,k}$. The polynomiality property enables us to compute explicitly the above action in terms of the Demazure-Lusztig elements and stable envelopes. Applications include: (1) Computation of the Iwarhori-Coulomb branch action for $G/P$ by taking the confluent limit, recovering Peterson-Lam-Shimozono's theorem. (2) Construction of an explicit Namikawa-Weyl group action on the equivariant quantum cohomology of $T^*(G/P)$ that preserves the quantum product, extending a result of Li-Su-Xiong. (3) Proof of a conjecture of Braverman-Finkelberg-Nakajima stating that, up to a shift of the dilation parameter, $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathfrak{g}^*}^{\mathrm{Gr}}$ is isomorphic to the spherical subalgebra of $\mathcal{H}_{G,\hbar,k}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we prove "prismatic Kunz's theorem" which states that a complete Noetherian local ring $R$ of residue characteristic $p$ is a regular local ring if and only if the Frobenius lift on a prismatic complex of (a derived enhancement of) $R$ over a specific prism $(A, I)$ is faithfully flat. This generalizes classical Kunz's theorem from the perspective of extending the "Frobenius map" to mixed characteristic rings. Our approach involves studying the deformation problem of the "regularity" of prisms and demonstrating the faithful flatness of the structure map of the prismatic complex.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $θ$ be an involution of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and $(\mathrm{U}_v,\mathrm{U}^\imath_v)$ be the associated quantum symmetric pair at an odd root of unity $v$. In this paper, generalizing the approach of De Concini-Kac-Procesi for quantum groups, we study the structures and irreducible representations of the iquantum group $\mathrm{U}^\imath_v$. We establish a Frobenius center of $\mathrm{U}^\imath_v$ as a coideal subalgebra of the Frobenius center of the quantum group $\mathrm{U}_v$. Via a quantum Frobenius map, we show that the Frobenius center of $\mathrm{U}^\imath_v$ is isomorphic to the coordinate algebra of a Poisson homogeneous space $\mathcal{X}$ of the dual Poisson-Lie group $G^*$. We define a filtration on $\mathrm{U}^\imath_v$ such that the associated graded algebra is $q$-commutative. Using this filtration, we show that the full center of $\mathrm{U}^\imath_v$ is generated by the Frobenius center and the Kolb-Letzter center, and we determine the degree of $\mathrm{U}^\imath_v$. We show that irreducible representations of $\mathrm{U}^\imath_v$ are parametrized by $θ$-twisted conjugacy classes. We determine the maximal dimension of those irreducible representations, and show that the dimension of an irreducible representation is maximal if the corresponding twisted conjugacy class has maximal dimension. We also study the branching problem for irreducible $\mathrm{U}_v$-modules when restricting to $\mathrm{U}^\imath_v$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ and $\ell$ be prime numbers, and $d\ge1$ an integer. We formulate and prove Iwasawa main conjectures of the Picard groups and Bowen--Franks groups in $\mathbb{Z}_p^d$-towers of digraphs. In particular, we relate the $\ell$ parts of these groups to certain $p$-adic $L$-functions defined using a voltage assignment. In the case where $\ell$ is not equal to $p$, we make use of the recent work of Bandini--Longhi to define the appropriate characteristic ideals. We also prove the growth of the $\ell$-part of these groups, generalizing classical results of Sinnott and Washington on ideal class groups of number fields. Finally, we introduce the concept of defect, which compare certain algebraic and analytic ranks related to Bowen--Franks groups and study their asymptotic behaviour in a $\mathbb{Z}_p^d$-tower.</p></details>

In this paper, we provide a combinatorial answer to Kostant's problem for the modules $L_{z}$ when $z$ has shape (associated Young diagram/integer partition via Robinson-Schensted correspondence) equal to $(n-2,1,1)$ or $(n-3,2,1)$. Moreover, we verify that certain closely related conjectures hold for such permutations, including the Indecomposability Conjecture, which states that applying any indecomposable projective functor to the corresponding simple highest weight module outputs either an indecomposable module or zero.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The d'Arcais numbers are the triangular array $\{A(2,n,k)\, :\, n=0,1,\dots,\, k=0,\dots,n\}$, such that $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{n} A(2,n,k) x^k z^n/n! = ((z;z)_{\infty})^{-x}$. The infinite $q$-Pochhammer symbol is $(q;q)_{\infty} = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1-q^n)$. Holding $k$ fixed and considering large $n$, we note that the ratio $k! A(2,n,k)/n!$ is asymptotic to $C(k) σ_{2k-1}(n)/n^k$ where the divisor sum function is $σ_p(n) = \sum_{d|n} d^p$ and $C(k) = (ζ(2))^k/(Γ(k) ζ(2k))$. This is a slightly generalized version of one of Ramanujan's formulas from his paper, ``On Certain Arithmetical Functions," and it is an immediate consequence of the more recent article of Oliver, Shreshta and Thorne. Heim and Neuhauser made a conjecture, that $A(2,n,k)/A(2,n,k-1)$ is greater than or equal to $A(2,n,k+1)/A(2,n,k)$, for $k=2,3,\dots$ and all $n$. The conjecture is false for $k=2$, and it is true for $k=3,4,\dots$ when $n$ is sufficiently large. We consider the Hardy-Ramanujan circle method as a heuristic step.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we construct a new family of sets based on Diophantine approximation in the Euclidean space, and consider their applications in several problems in harmonic analysis. Our first application is on the Hausdorff dimension of our sets. We show a recent result of Ren and Wang on the ABC sum-product problem is sharp. Higher dimensional cases and the relation to orthogonal projections are also discussed. Some conjectures are proposed. In addition to Hausdorff dimension, we also consider Fourier dimension. For every $0\leq t\leq s\leq 1$, we are able to construct a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that has Hausdorff dimension $s$ and Fourier dimension $t$, together with a measure $μ$ that captures both dimensions, i.e., $$μ(B(x,r))\lesssim_εr^{s-ε} \ \text{and} \ |\hatμ(ξ)|\lesssim_ε|ξ|^{-t/2 +ε}, \ \forall\,ε>0.$$ It is fundamental but the very first such result in the literature. Our last result is to provide a viewpoint of the sharpness of Fourier restriction over general measures from dimensions of sets and measures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give an explicit description of the arithmetic-geometric extension of iterated Galois groups of rational functions. This yields a complete solution to the extension problem when either the arithmetic or the geometric iterated Galois group is branch, answering a question of Adams and Hyde. Furthermore, we obtain a sufficient condition for the arithmetic iterated Galois group of a rational function to have positive fixed-point proportion, which further applies in many instances to the specialization to non strictly post-critical points. In particular, this holds for all unicritical polynomials of odd degree, which greatly generalizes a result of Radi for the polynomial $z^d+1$. Lastly, we obtain the first family of groups acting on the $d$-adic tree whose fixed-point process becomes eventually $d$ for any $d\ge 2$ with positive probability. What is more, these groups are fractal and branch and thus positive-dimensional; hence they yield the first family of counterexamples to a conjecture of Jones for every $d$-adic tree.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This revised version incorporates a proof of the fact that the average order of the subclass of these height functions is inversely correlated to the asymptotic growth of their related multi-partition function

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The height $H(n)$ of $n$ is the least integer $i$ such that the $i$-th iterate of Euler's totient function $\varphi^{(i)}(n)$ equals $1$. H. N. Shapiro showed that this $H$ is almost completely additive. Building on the fact that this function can be modified to yield a completely additive function, we establish a general correspondence: to every multi-partition structure there corresponds a completely additive function. In this paper, a \emph{height function} is a completely additive map $H:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}_0$ with $H(1)=0$ whose prime fibres $\{p:\,H(p)=k\}$ are finite for every $k\ge1$. Writing $$ π_k=\#\{p:\,H(p)=k\},\qquad N_k=\#\{n:\,H(n)=k\}, $$ complete additivity forces the identity $$ \sum_{k\ge0}N_k q^k \;=\; \prod_{j\ge1}(1-q^j)^{-π_j}. $$ Thus, the prime--height profile $(π_k)$ canonically determines the height multiplicities $(N_k)$, linking to the asymptotic theory of weighted partitions. We introduce a broad class of iteratively defined heights on primes, encompassing Matula-type heights (encoding rooted trees) and Shapiro-type totient heights, and show they extend to genuine height functions. In the Matula case this yields a purely number-theoretic proof of the classical extremal bounds for minimal and maximal Matula numbers, answering a question of Gutman and Ivić without recourse to graph theory. Using Meinardus' theorem we prove an \emph{inverse-growth} principle in the polynomial regime: if $Π(x)=\sum_{j\le x}π_j \sim (C/α)x^α$, then $\log N_k$ satisfies a stretched-exponential law with an explicit constant, and conversely under a standard Tauberian hypothesis. We further derive average-order consequences in this regime for a canonical sequential realization of a given profile. Finally, we briefly discuss behavior beyond the polynomial setting, with computations in the Shapiro case suggesting substantially richer phenomena.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a smooth quasi-affine variety $X$, the affine closure $\overline{T^*X} := \text{Spec}(\mathbb{K}[T^*X])$ contains $T^*X$ as an open subset, and its smooth locus carries a symplectic structure. A natural question is whether $\overline{T^*X}$ itself is a symplectic variety. A notable example is the conjecture of Ginzburg and Kazhdan, which predicts that $\overline{T^*(G/U)}$ is symplectic for a maximal unipotent subgroup $U$ in a reductive linear algebraic group $G$. This conjecture was recently proved by Gannon using representation-theoretic methods. In this paper, we provide a new geometric approach to this conjecture. Our method allows us to prove a more general result: $\overline{T^*(G/H)}$ is symplectic for any horospherical subgroup $H$ in $G$ such that $G/H$ is quasi-affine. In particular, this implies that the affine closure $\overline{T^*(G/[P,P])}$ is a symplectic variety for any parabolic subgroup $P$ in $G$.</p></details>

We are interested in the set $S_t=\set{(x,y)\in C_λ\times C_λ: xy=t}$, where $t\in[0,1]$. Since the cases where $t=0$ or $t=1$ are trivial, we assume that $t\in(0,1)$ in what follows.

> **Comment:** 87 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article is an expository account aimed at viewing entanglement in finite-dimensional quantum many-body systems as a phenomenon of global geometry. While the mathematics of general quantum states has been studied extensively, this article focuses specifically on their entanglement. When a quantum system varies over a classical parameter space, each fiber may look like the same Hilbert space, yet there may be no global identification because of twisting in the gluing data. Describing this situation by an Azumaya algebra, one always obtains the family of pure-state spaces as a Severi-Brauer scheme. The main focus is to characterize the condition under which the subsystem decomposition required to define entanglement exists globally and compatibly, by a reduction to the stabilizer subgroup of the Segre variety, and to explain that the obstruction appears in the Brauer class. As a consequence, quantum states yield a natural filtration dictated by entanglement on the Severi-Brauer scheme. Using a spin system on a torus as an example, we show concretely that the holonomy of the gluing can produce an entangling quantum gate, and can appear as an obstruction class distinct from the usual Berry numbers or Chern numbers. For instance, even for quantum systems that have traditionally been regarded as having no topological band structure, the entanglement of their eigenstates can be related to global geometric universal quantities, reflecting the background geometry.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Christol and, independently, Denef and Lipshitz showed that an algebraic sequence of $p$-adic integers (or integers) is $p$-automatic when reduced modulo $p^α$. Previously, the best known bound on the minimal automaton size for such a sequence was doubly exponential in $α$. Under mild conditions, we improve this bound to the order of $p^{α^3 h d}$, where $h$ and $d$ are the height and degree of the minimal annihilating polynomial modulo $p$. We achieve this bound by showing that all states in the automaton are naturally represented in a new numeration system. This significantly restricts the set of possible states. Since our approach embeds algebraic sequences as diagonals of rational functions, we also obtain bounds more generally for diagonals of multivariate rational functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For many common height functions, the explicit determination of the essential minimum is an open problem. We consider a classical method to obtain lower bounds that goes back at least to C.J. Smyth, and a method to obtain upper bounds based on the knowledge of the limit distribution of integral points. We use an infinite dimensional linear programming scheme to show that that both methods agree in the limit, by showing that the principle of strong duality holds in our situation. As a corollary we prove that the essential minimum can be attained by sequences of algebraic integers. Recent results by A. Smith and B. Orloski--N. Sardari, furnish a characterization of compactly supported measures that can be approximated by complete sets of conjugates of algebraic integers, in terms of infinitely many nonnegativity conditions. We establish an extension of this characterization to measures with non necessarily compact support. As an application of this result and of strong duality, we show that the essential minimum is a computable real number when the Green function used to define the height is computable. We systematically use potential theory for measures that can integrate functions with logarithmic growth.</p></details>

We also study the corresponding problem in vector spaces over finite fields. In $\mathbb F_q^n$ we obtain stronger quantitative bounds, including polylogarithmic savings, by combining Fourier-analytic transference with polynomial-method input from the arithmetic cycle-removal lemma of Fox-Lovász-Sauermann.</p></details>

Using magical operators that are compatible with weight spaces, we classify weight Verma modules and characterise their irreducible finite dimensional quotients. We then prove the existence of weight bases in tensor products by explicitly constructing some highest weight vectors. These constructions allow us to mimic the important aspects of the classical finite dimensional representation theory. Applications include a definition of rational representations, the BGG resolution, a Clebsch--Gordan formula, the Harish-Chandra isomorphism and central characters, as well as a classification and description of all irreducible polynomial representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a writeup of a resolution of Erdős Problem #728; this is the first Erdős problem (a problem proposed by Paul Erdős which has been collected in the Erdős Problems website) regarded as fully resolved autonomously by an AI system. The system in question is a combination of GPT-5.2 Pro by OpenAI and Aristotle by Harmonic, operated by Kevin Barreto. The final result of the system is a formal proof written in Lean, which we translate to informal mathematics in the present writeup for wider accessibility. The proved result is as follows. We show a logarithmic-gap phenomenon regarding factorial divisibility: For any constants $0<C_1<C_2$ and $0 < \varepsilon < 1/2$ there exist infinitely many triples $(a,b,n)\in\mathbb N^3$ with $\varepsilon n \le a,b \le (1-\varepsilon)n$ such that $$ a!\,b!\mid n!\,(a+b-n)!\qquad\text{and}\qquad C_1\log n < a+b-n < C_2\log n. $$ The argument reduces this to a binomial divisibility $\binom{m+k}{k}\mid\binom{2m}{m}$ and studies it prime-by-prime. By Kummer's theorem, $ν_p\binom{2m}{m}$ translates into a carry count for doubling $m$ in base $p$. We then employ a counting argument to find, in each scale $[M,2M]$, an integer $m$ whose base-$p$ expansions simultaneously force many carries when doubling $m$, for every prime $p\le 2k$, while avoiding the rare event that one of $m+1,\dots,m+k$ is divisible by an unusually high power of $p$. These "carry-rich but spike-free" choices of $m$ force the needed $p$-adic inequalities and the divisibility. The overall strategy is similar to results regarding divisors of $\binom{2n}{n}$ studied earlier by Erdős and by Pomerance.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For integers $n,k \geq 1$, let $S_k(n)$ denote the power sum $1^k +2^k + \cdots + n^k$. In this note, we first recall the minimal recurrence relation connecting $S_k(n)$ and $S_{k-1}(n)$ established by Abramovich (1973). We then discuss an odd algorithm to determine the coefficients of the power sum polynomial $S_k(n)$ in terms of the coefficients of $S_{k-1}(n)$ (see, e.g., Bloom (1993) and Owens (1992)). Moreover, we bring to light an explicit relationship between $S_k(n)$ and $S_{k+1}(n)$ put forward by Budin and Cantor (1972). We conclude that these procedures (including the integration formula expressing $S_k(n)$ in terms of $S_{k-1}(n)$) all constitute equivalent methods to determine $S_k(n)$ starting from $S_{k-1}(n)$. In addition, as a by-product, we provide a determinantal formula for the Bernoulli numbers involving the binomial coefficients.</p></details>

We provide a solution to this problem using the character sum method, which offers a new unified framework applicable to a broad class of polynomial enumeration problems over finite fields that involve prescribed evaluation vectors. This work effectively makes the first systematic attempt to study the coset weight distribution problem for Reed-Muller codes of fixed degree over large finite fields, which was proposed in MacWilliams and Sloane's 1977 textbook \emph{The Theory of Error Correcting Codes}.</p></details>

The function thus satisfies an analogue of the Riemann Hypothesis together with the sharp bounded/unbounded transition at $σ= 1$ characteristic of $ζ$. The construction uses Hadamard products with controlled zero perturbations; the transition is proved unconditionally via a dyadic large-sieve argument and a Phragmén-Lindelöf transfer.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A. Bondal introduced a symplectic groupoid of triangular bilinear forms. This induces the Poisson structure on $\mathcal{A}_n$, the space of $n \times n$ unipotent upper-triangular matrices. L. Chekhov and M. Shapiro described log-canonical coordinates on this symplectic groupoid via the $\mathcal{A}_n$-quiver. In this paper, we introduce a birational Weyl group action on the symplectic groupoid. It is generated by cluster transformations associated with certain cycles of the quiver. We prove that every matrix entry of $\mathcal{A}_n$ is invariant under this action. Conversely, we prove that matrix entries generate the Poisson subalgebra of Weyl group invariants in the ring of regular functions on the cluster variety $\mathcal X_{|\mathcal A_n|}$. V. Fock and L. Chekhov defined a Poisson map $φ_n$ from the Teichmüller space $\mathcal{T}_{g,s}$ with genus $g$ and $s \in \{1,2\}$ boundary components into $\mathcal{A}_n$. We aim to describe the cluster structure of $\text{Im}(φ_n)$ by applying a Hamiltonian reduction to $\mathcal A_n$. Since every element in $\text{Im}(φ_n)$ satisfies the rank condition $\text{rank}(A+A^T) \le 4$, it provides a natural criterion for our Hamiltonian reduction. The solution set of the rank condition has distinct irreducible components, so the reduction might be component-dependent. However, we show that the Weyl group acts transitively on these components. This implies that the Hamiltonian reductions are conjugate; thus, it suffices to determine the reduction on a single component. Furthermore, we prove that the longest element of the Weyl group corresponds to a cluster DT-transformation on the $\mathcal{A}_{2k}$-quiver. In contrast, we show that no reddening sequence exists for odd $n$.</p></details>

The geometry of this representation is studied, including the geometric meaning of digits, properties of cylinder sets -- particularly the specificity of their overlaps -- and metric relations, as well as the connection between the representation and partial sums of the corresponding series. The paper also presents results on the study of a function $f$ defined by $f(x=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{α_n}{(r+1)^n})=Δ^{r_s}_{α_1α_2...α_n...}, α_n\in A.$ It is proved that the function $f$ is continuous at every point that has a unique representation in the classical numeration system with base $r+1$, and discontinuous at points having two representations. The function has unbounded variation and a self-affine graph. For $r<2s-1$, the function possesses singleton, finite, countable, and continuum level sets, including fractal ones; for $r>2s-2$, every level set is a continuum, and moreover it is fractal or anomalously fractal.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbf{Q}_p$ and let $\mathcal{G}_K = \mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbf{Q}_p}/K)$. Lately, interest has risen around a generalization of the theory of $(\varphi,Γ)$-modules, replacing the cyclotomic extension with an arbitrary infinitely ramified $p$-adic Lie extension. Computations from Berger suggest that locally analytic vectors should provide such a generalization for any arbitrary infinitely ramified $p$-adic Lie extension, and this has been conjectured by Kedlaya. In this paper, we focus on the case of $\mathbf{Z}_p$-extensions, using recent work of Berger-Rozensztajn and Porat on an integral version of locally analytic vectors and explain what can be the structure of the locally analytic vectors in the higher rings of periods $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}^{\dagger}$ in this setting. We show that the existence of nontrivial locally analytic vectors in $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}^{\dagger}$, a necessary condition for Kedlaya's conjecture to hold, is equivalent to the existence of an overconvergent lift of the field of norms attached to the $\mathbf{Z}_p$-extension. Finally, in the case where $K/\mathbf{Q}_p$ is unramified, we are able to prove that the only extensions for which such nontrivial locally analytic vectors exist are exactly the twisted cyclotomic extensions, up to a finite extension. In particular, this disproves Kedlaya's conjecture and also shows that there is no overconvergent lift of the field of norms in the anticyclotomic setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the zeros of theta functions $Θ_{Γ_{4k}}$ associated with the lattices $Γ_{4k}$, a family of self-dual lattices generalizing the $\mathsf{E}_{8}$ lattice. Our results show two different behaviors of the zeros according to the lattice parity: When $Γ_{4k}$ is an even lattice, we show that the zeros all lie on the line $\Re z =\frac{1}{2}$ in the fundamental domain and prove that the zeros are equidistributed with respect to an explicit probability measure on the line $\Re z = \frac{1}{2}$. However, when the $Γ_{4k}$ is an odd lattice, there are no zeros on the line $\Re z =\frac{1}{2}$, only exponentially close to it. Our argument relies on representing $Θ_{Γ_{4k}}$ as a polynomial in the modular $λ$-function. We then study the zeros of this polynomial and exploit some conformal properties of $λ$ to get our results.</p></details>

It is not necessary that the tensor product of Demazure crystals is isomorphic to a disjoint union of Demazure crystals. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the decomposition of the tensor product of Demazure crystals as a disjoint union of Demazure crystals. Our results are the generalization of the results proved by Anthony Joseph and Takafumi Kouno. As an application, we obtain a sufficient condition when the product of Demazure characters is a linear combination of Demazure characters with nonnegative integer coefficients.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The monograph develops a self-contained, mathematically rigorous framework for massless representations of the conformal group U(2,2) and their restriction to the de Sitter group Sp(2,2). It systematically constructs ladder (massless) representations, computes invariant bilinear forms and Casimir operators, and provides explicit constructions of vertex operators and two-point functions for low-helicity fields. The monograph employs a novel Clifford-split-octonion approach, embedding 8-component Majorana spinors within an alternative composition algebra, which allows for fully explicit algebraic, spinorial, and geometric constructions. The text bridges foundational representation theory, explicit computational methods, and physical applications in quantum field theory and cosmology. While targeted at researchers in mathematical physics, quantum cosmology, and quantum field theory, the exposition is pedagogically structured to guide advanced graduate students through subtle algebraic and representation-theoretic ideas, making complex constructions accessible without sacrificing rigor.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages, Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical Brauer-Siegel conjecture describes the asymptotic behaviour of the product of the class number and the regulator in families of number fields. All known cases of the conjecture rely on reducing the problem, via group theoretic methods, to Siegel's theorem for quadratic fields over Q or over a fixed base field. In this paper, we establish a new form of descent for the Brauer-Siegel conjecture. We show that if the conjecture holds for a family of almost Sn-fields, it necessarily holds for all quadratic extensions over that family, under mild conditions. This result may be viewed as an analogue of Siegel's theorem in which the base field is allowed to vary. In addition, we also establish the generalized Brauer-Siegel conjecture as formulated by Tsfasman-Vladut for asymptotically good towers of number fields over a family of almost Sn-fields.</p></details>

Then, given a supercuspidal representation $σ$ of ${\rm PGL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$, we study extensively the case that $π(f)$ is a projection onto the line of the newform if $π$ is isomorphc to $σ$ or its unramified quadratic twist, and $π(f) = 0$ otherwise. As a first application, we prove an optimal large sieve inequality for families of automorphic representations that arise in our framework.</p></details>

To this effect, we first set up some basics of a multi-tensor product theory of the generalized double-bosonization construction (see [HH2] for the latter). Such a grafting method, depending on the choice of grafting node in the Dynkin diagram, including rank-induction and type-crossing constructions as special cases, provides a one-stop resolving strategy of the generation question of Majid's quantum tree, which grows up from the root part $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ and decorates with the quantum groups of various Dynkin diagrams (of finite types) as the branches.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$, and let $\mathfrak{m}_K$ be its maximal ideal. The image of the group of principal units $1+\mathfrak{m}_K$ under $p$-adic logarithm plays important role in several areas of number theory. In general, when the ramification index of $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is greater or equal to $p-1$, the precise description of this image is not known. For the cyclotomic extension $K=\mathbb{Q}_p(ζ_p)$ of degree $p-1$, it was previously proved in \cite{MAS} that the image of the annulus region $(1+\mathfrak{m}_K) \setminus (1+\mathfrak{m}_K^2)$ by $p$-adic logarithm is exactly $\mathfrak{m}_K^2$. In this paper, we give a self-contained analytic proof of this result based on explicit $p$-adic logarithmic expansions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2013, Sun conjectured that the partition function $p(n)$ is never a perfect power for $n \geq 2$. Building on this, Merca, Ono, and Tsai recently observed that for any fixed integers $d \geq 0$ and $k \geq 2$, there appear to be only finitely many integers $n$ such that $p(n)$ differs from a perfect $k$th power by at most $d$. Denoting by $M_k(d)$ the largest such $n$, they conjectured that $M_k(d) = o(d^ε)$ for every $ε> 0$. In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic growth of analogs of $M_k(d)$ for a wide class of partition functions. We establish sharp lower bounds and provide heuristics which suggest that $M_k(d)$ in fact grows polylogarithmically in $d$, i.e. of order $\log^2(d)$. More generally, we prove that if $f(n)$ is a suitably random chosen function with asymptotic growth rate similar to that of $p(n)$, then the set of integers $n$ for which $f(n)$ is a perfect power is finite with probability 1.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Since the time of Minkowski a basic problem in number theory has been to find lower bounds for the absolute value $Δ(K)$ of the discriminant of a number field $K$ in terms of the degree $n(K)$ of $K$. In this paper we study another measure of the size of $K$ given by the covering radius $μ(K)$ of the ring of integers $O_K$ of $K$. Here $μ(K)$ is the $L^2$ radius $||V_2(K)||_2$ of the $L^2$ Voronoi cell $V_2(K)$ of $O_K$, where $V_2(K)$ is the set of points in $\mathbb{R} \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}} K$ that are at least as close to the origin as they are to any non-zero element of $O_K$. To put a limit on what lower bounds one can prove for $μ(K)$ in terms of $n(K)$, we study infinite families of $K$ of increasing degree for which $μ(K)$ can be bounded above by an explicit power of $n(K)$. We also study analogous questions when the $L^2$ norm is replaced by the $L^\infty$ norm.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Landau--Gonek Theorem evaluates $X^ρ$ summed over the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Their result shows great sensitivity to the arithmetic nature of $X$. We prove a related result concerning the sum of $χ(ρ) X^ρ$ over the zeros of zeta, where $χ(s)$ is the term arising in the functional equation for the zeta function. Again, this result depends deeply on whether $X$ is an integer or not. We show the result splits into three cases, depending on whether $X$ is smaller than $T$, about the same size as $T$, or bigger than $T$. The reason this result is useful is that it easily permits the calculation of discrete moments of the Riemann zeta function via the approximate functional equation. As an application of this result, we provide an alternative proof of Shanks' conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We are intereseted in quandles and their enveloping groups. Various results are proven. We show that a quandle $Q$ and its image in the enveloping group $G(Q)$ have isomorphic enveloping groups. The image quandle is injective. For $Q$ a finite quandle, we show that $G(Q)$ admits a faithfull representation $ρ: G(Q)\to GL_n(\mathbb{Z})$ for some $n$; an irreducible representation of $G(Q)$ over $\mathbb{C}$ is finite dimensional an its degree divides the order of the group $Inn(Q)$ of inner automorphism of $Q$. We determine the Malcev Lie algebra and the rational cohomology ring of $G(Q)$ for $Q$ finite. We prove that a finite injective quandle is a subquandle (for conjugacy) of a finite group. We also prove that the only finite subquandles (for conjugacy) of uniquely divisible groups are trivial quandles and that morphisms from quandles to nilpotent groups (for conjugacy) are constant on the indecomposable components. Implication of these results are considered.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We make further progress towards a Kneser-type generalization of Pollard's Theorem to general abelian groups. For two sets $A$ and $B$ in an abelian group $G$, the \emph{$t$-popular sumset} of $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A+_t B$, is the set of elements in $G$ each with at least $t$ representations of the form $a+b$, where $a\in A$ and $b\in B$. For $|A|,\, |B|\ge t\geq 2$, we prove that if \begin{align*} \sum_{i=1}^t |A+_i B|< t|A|+t|B|-\frac{4}{3}t^2+\frac{2}{3}t, \end{align*} then there exist $A'\subseteq A$ and $B'\subseteq B$ with $|A\setminus A'|+|B\setminus B'|\le t-1$, $A'+_t B'=A'+B'=A+_t B$, and $ \sum_{i=1}^t |A+_i B|\ge t|A|+t|B|-t|H|,$ where $H$ is the stabilizer of $A'+B'=A+_t B$. Our result improves the main quadratic term in the previous best bound from $-2t^2$ to $-\frac{4}{3}t^2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the set of complex irrationals whose partial quotients in their Hurwitz continued fraction expansion are naturally regarded as subsets of $\mathbb Z^2$ and contain infinitely many homothetic copies of any finite subset of $\mathbb Z^2$ is of Hausdorff dimension $1$. Our result provides a clear and concrete example of multidimensional pattern emergence in number-theoretic expansions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct Poisson vertex algebra (PVA) structures on arc spaces from $1$-shifted symplectic (QP) data. A Hamiltonian satisfying the classical master equation induces a canonical PVA $λ$-bracket, matching the Hamiltonian-operator formalism for integrable hierarchies. As applications, we find the resulting PVA sheaves on $\mathbb P^1$ and reinterpret our classical $R$-matrix as Maurer-Cartan data in a deformation-theoretic geometric framework, yielding AKS-type integrable hierarchies from the corresponding $R$-deformations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose an efficient computational method for finding all solutions $n\leq U$ to the Diophantine equation $aσ(n) = bn + c$, where integer coefficient $a,b,c$ and an upper bound $U$ are given. Our method is implemented in SageMath computer algebra system within the framework of recursively enumerated sets and natively benefits from MapReduce parallelization. We used it to discover new solutions to many published equations and close gaps in between the known large solutions, including but not limited to hyperperfect and $f$-perfect numbers, as well as to significantly lift the existence bounds in open questions about quasiperfect and almost-perfect numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The L-function $ L(ρ_λ, s) $ of an almost everywhere unramified $ λ$-adic representation $ ρ_λ$ of a global function field $ \mathbb{F}_q(C) $ is known to be a rational function in $ q^{-s} $ satisfying a functional equation up to some complex sign $ ε(ρ_λ) $. This paper presents a systematic framework to compute the coefficients of $ L(ρ_λ, s) $ and its sign $ ε(ρ_λ) $ with some explicit examples.</p></details>
