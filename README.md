 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Claus Hertling, Khadija Larabi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The full lattices in a finite dimensional commutative ${\mathbb Q}$-algebra form a commutative semigroup. In the case of an algebraic number field the top part of a certain quotient semigroup is the class group. For a separable algebra some basic results, especially the Jordan-Zassenhaus theorem, are known for this quotient semigroup. This paper considers also algebras which are not separable. It studies the commutative semigroup of full lattices in such an algebra and also the quotient semigroup. This leads in this commutative, but not separable situation to a certain extension of the Jordan-Zassenhaus theorem. One application concerns $GL_n({\mathbb Z})$-conjugacy classes of regular integer $n\times n$ matrices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a connected reductive group defined and split over a non-archimedean local field $F$. We give a new geometric proof of a special case of a recent theorem of Solleveld. Namely, we show that the class of standard Iwahori-spherical $G(F)$-representations, a notion a priori dependent on the coefficient field being the complex numbers, is actually defined over $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$. An unpublished theorem of Clozel, proven with global techniques, says that the class of essentially square-integrable representations is also defined over $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$. As an application of our main result, we give a local proof of this theorem for $G=\mathrm{GL}_n$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Esha Gupta &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 30 pages, added Section 6 to prove connection with arXiv:2602.03659

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite-dimensional algebra $Λ$ over an algebraically closed field $K$, it is known that the poset of $2$-term silting objects in $\mathrm{K}^b(\mathrm{proj}Λ)$ is isomorphic to the poset of functorially finite torsion classes in $\mathrm{mod}Λ$, and to that of complete cotorsion classes in $\mathrm{K}^{[-1,0]}(\mathrm{proj}Λ)$. In this work, we generalise this result to the case of $d$-term silting objects for arbitrary $d\geq 2$ by introducing the notion of torsion classes for extriangulated categories. In particular, we show that the poset of $d$-term silting objects in $\mathrm{K}^b(\mathrm{proj}Λ)$ is isomorphic to the poset of complete and hereditary cotorsion classes in $\mathrm{K}^{[-d+1,0]}(\mathrm{proj}Λ)$, and to that of positive and functorially finite torsion classes in $D^{[-d+2,0]}(\mathrm{mod}Λ)$, an extension-closed subcategory of $D^b(\mathrm{mod}Λ)$. We further show that the posets $\mathrm{cotors}\mathrm{K}^{[-d+1,0]}(\mathrm{proj}Λ)$ and $\mathrm{tors} D^{[-d+2,0]}(\mathrm{mod}Λ)$ are lattices, and that the truncation functor $τ_{\geq -d+2}$ gives an isomorphism between the two.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Mikhail Venchakov &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 21 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $U$ be a maximal unipotent subgroup in a symplectic group over a finite field of sufficiently large characteristic $p$. According to the Kirillov's orbit method, the coadjoint orbits of the group $U$ play the key role in the description of irreducible complex characters of $U$. Almost all important classes of orbits and characters studied to the moment can be uniformly described as the orbits and characters associated with so-called orthogonal rook placements. In the paper, we construct a semi-direct decomposition for the corresponding irreducible characters in the spirit of the Mackey little group method. As a corollary, we present an explicit formula for the character corresponding to an orbit of maximal possible dimension.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a geometric theta correspondence from the first homology of a modular curve, to modular forms of weight $2$. Using Stevens' description of the homology, we find that this map sends modular symbols to product of weight one Eisenstein series, modular caps to weight $2$ Eisenstein series, and hyperbolic cycles to diagonal restrictions of Hilbert-Eisenstein series. We use it to revisit work of Borisov and Gunnells, and explain its connection to a theorem of Li. In particular, we give a geometric proof of certain relations between Eisenstein series.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 95 pages. Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We will attach a scalar invariant to a tetrahedron whose edges are labelled by irreducible representations of a ternary orthogonal group $\mathrm{SO}_3$ over a local field. This generalizes the $6j$ symbol whose theory was developed by Racah, Wigner, and Regge. We give several formulas for this invariant, including in terms of hypergeometric-type integrals and functions, and show that it admits a symmetry by the the $23040$-element Weyl group of $\mathrm{Spin}_{12}$. We then interpret these results in terms of relative Langlands duality, where the dual story comes from the action of $\mathrm{Spin}_{12}$ on a $16$-dimensional cone of spinors.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** L. Ruhstorfer, A. A. Schaeffer Fry &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we prove that a recent condition of Lyons--Martínez--Navarro--Tiep, regarding the field of values of extensions of characters in principal blocks, is satisfied for all finite simple groups, which when combined with their results gives a new characterization of finite groups with a normal $\ell$-complement for a prime $\ell$. This leads us to study the distribution of characters in unipotent blocks of disconnected reductive groups and show that this is well-behaved under a generalization of $d$-Harish-Chandra theory. We go on to study the blockwise Galois--McKay (also known as the Alperin--McKay--Navarro) conjecture for the blocks of almost (quasi-)simple groups above unipotent blocks.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 44 pages, 4 tables, 4 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Following Hausel-Hitchin, we investigate core Lagrangians and upward flows in Hilbert schemes of points on elliptic surfaces. We compute the scheme-theoretic multiplicities of core Lagrangians, as well as the equivariant multiplicities of the very stable ones. Furthermore, we extend the notion of equivariant multiplicity to wobbly components and compute it for Hilbert schemes of two points. Inspired by Eisenstein series functor in Dolbeault Langlands correspondence, we propose that upward flows of very stable ideals are mirror dual to modified Procesi bundles, and justify this claim through numerical checks. Finally, we make some conjectures about extending this picture to wobbly upward flows.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a criterion for determining when a family of geometric functors is jointly conservative through the lens of purity in compactly generated triangulated categories. We introduce the notion of pure descendability and we apply it to two particular situations involving sequential limits of ring spectra.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Michael R. Powers &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Relatively little is known about the arithmetic properties of Gamma-function derivatives evaluated at arbitrary points $q\in\mathbb{Q}\setminus\mathbb{Z}_{\leq0}$. In recent work, we showed that the sequence $\left\{ Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(1\right)\right\}_{n\geq1}$ contains transcendental elements infinitely often. That result is now generalized to all sequences $\left\{Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(q\right)\right\}_{n\geq1}$ for $q\in\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}\setminus\mathbb{Z}_{\leq0}$. Moreover, for all such $q$ we derive a lower bound, $β\left(N\right)=\max\left\{0,\sqrt{N}-5/2\right\}/N$, for the density of transcendental elements $Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(q\right)$ among $n\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,N\right\}$. For $q\in\mathbb{Q}\setminus\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}$, we find the somewhat weaker result that at least one of the sequences $\left\{Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(q\right)\right\}_{n\geq1}$, $\left\{Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(1-q\right)\right\}_{n\geq1}$ contains infinitely many transcendental elements.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G/K$ be a Hermitian symmetric space and $V_τ$ an irreducible representation of $K$. We study the ring $\mathcal D^G(G/K, V_τ)$ of $G$-invariant differential operators on sections of vector bundles $G\times_{(K, τ)} V_τ$ over $G/K$ defined by a finite-dimensional representation $(V_τ, τ)$ of $K$. We classify irreducible representations $(V_τ, τ)$ such that $\mathcal D^G(G/K, V_τ)$ is commutative. We construct eigenfunctions for the differential operators and study the invariance property of the eigenvalues under the Weyl group for the restricted real root system of $G$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Trajan Hammonds &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 29 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The asymptotics of relative characters for real Lie groups were studied for representations $(π, σ)$ arising from Gan-Gross-Prasad pairs $(G,H)$ by Nelson and Venkatesh. They successfully compute the asymptotics of relative characters whenever the conductor of the associated Rankin-Selberg $L$-function $L(π\boxtimes σ^\vee)$ lies in a stable locus, i.e. away from conductor dropping. In this paper, we express asymptotics for relative characters in the non-archimedean setting for $(\mathrm{PGL}_2, \mathrm{GL}_1)$. The key new innovation is that our method overcomes the stability hypothesis and allows for significant conductor dropping.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14718v1'>2602.14718</a>\]&nbsp; **Completing the classification of torsion subgroups for rational elliptic curves over sextic fields**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nikola Adžaga, Tomislav Gužvić &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We complete the classification of torsion subgroups $E(K)_{\text{tors}}$ that can occur for an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ over a sextic number field $K$. Previous work determined the complete set of these groups, leaving the existence of only one group in question: $C_3 \oplus C_{18}$. We prove that this group does not occur. Our proof relies on the theory of Galois representations attached to elliptic curves. The assumed existence of a $C_3 \oplus C_{18}$ torsion subgroup would impose strong, simultaneous constraints on the mod-$2$ and $3$-adic Galois representations of the curve. By applying the recent classification of $\ell$-adic Galois images for elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$, we translate these arithmetic constraints into a problem of Diophantine geometry: the $j$-invariant of such a curve must correspond to a rational point on one of the finitely many modular curves. We then analyze these curves using classical methods and show that none have the necessary rational points corresponding to elliptic curves without complex multiplication, thereby proving our main result.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Philemon Urbain Mballa &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article proposes a unified analytical approach leading to a partial resolution of the Erdos-Straus, Sierpinski conjectures, and their generalization. We introduce an equivalent reformulation of these conjectures while constructing two new explicit analytical formulas. The first formula, which is a special case of the second, is based on a divisibility condition, whereas the second, more general formula, relies on the existence of a perfect square, which we conjecture to always hold. Under these conditions, the formulas verify the conjectures even for very large numerical values. Moreover, our method reduces the problem to the search for a suitable perfect square, thereby opening the way to a complete proof of these conjectures. In conclusion, we present open questions and conjectures to the mathematical community regarding the generalization of these formulas.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Bikram Misra, Biswajyoti Saha &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the triple convolution sum of the generalised divisor functions $$\sum_{n\leq x} d_k(n+h)d_l(n)d_m(n-h),$$ where $h \le x^{1-ε}$ for any $ε>0$ and $d_k(n)$ denotes the generalised divisor function which counts the number of ways $n$ can be written as a product of $k$ many positive integers. The purpose of this paper is three-fold. Firstly, we note a predicted asymptotic estimate for the above sum, where the constant appearing in the estimate can be obtained from the theory of Dirichlet series of several complex variables and also using some probabilistic arguments. Then we show that a lower bound of the correct order can be derived using the several variable Tauberian theorems, where, more importantly, the constant in the predicted asymptotic can be recovered. Lastly, in the spirit of the Titchmarsh divisor problem, we consider this triple convolution sum over the prime numbers, which essentially leads to a shifted convolution sum. We use the Tauberian theory of multiple Dirichlet series along with the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem to derive an explicit lower bound of this.</p></details>

> **Comment:** There is a gap in the proof of Theorem 3.1

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite-dimensional algebra Λ, we establish an explicit bijection between widely generated torsion(-free) classes and semibricks in mod Λ. Using the kappa order on the lattice of torsion classes with canonical join representations, we provide several equivalent conditions for brick-finite algebras. We show that Λ is brick-finite if and only if any chain of wide subcategories of mod Λ becomes eventually constant, if and only if any torsion class in mod Λ has finitely many covers, if and only if every semibrick in mod Λ is a finite set. Thus, we give a proof of Enomoto's conjecture (Adv. Math., 393 (2021), 108113). As a consequence, we show that Λ is brick-finite if and only if every wide subcategory closed under coproducts of Mod Λ is closed under products, if and only if every wide subcategory of mod Λ is functorially finite. This gives a positive answer to the question posed by Angeleri Hügel and Sentieri (J. Algebra, 664 (2025), 164-205).</p></details>

> **Comment:** 22 pages. This paper generalizes Part 1 of "Complete affine manifolds with Anosov holonomy groups,'' ArXiv:2009.11127, and Part 2 is dropped. The main setting has changed over to flat vector bundles. This involved many changes. Part 2 is still available at ArXiv:2009.11127. Furthermore, we generalized the premise of the main theorem to include a subexponential growth condition on singular values

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $N$ be a manifold of dimension $m$ with a flat vector bundle given by a representation $ρ:π_1(N) \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbf{R})$ where $π_1(N)$ is finitely generated. The holonomy group $ρ$ is a $k$-partially hyperbolic holonomy representation if the flat bundle pulled back over the unit tangent bundle of a sufficiently large compact submanifold of $N$ splits into expanding, neutral, and contracting subbundles along the geodesic flow, where the expanding and contracting subbundles are $k$-dimensional with $k < n/2$. Suppose that each element of $ρ(π_1(N))$ has an eigenvalue of norm $1$, or, alternatively, $ρ$ has some singular values of subexponential growth in terms of word length. We show that $ρ$ is a $P$-Anosov representation for a parabolic subgroup $P$ of $\mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbf{R})$ if and only if $ρ$ is a partially hyperbolic representation. We are going to primarily employ representation theory techniques. As an application, we will show that the equivalence holds when $N$ is a complete affine $n$-manifold, and $ρ$ is a linear part of the holonomy representation. This had never been done over the full general linear group.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Minor changes in the new version : simplified a proof, added a bound, added citations/remarks, few edits

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We are intereseted in quandles and their enveloping groups. Various results are proven. We show that a quandle $Q$ and its image in the enveloping group $G(Q)$ have isomorphic enveloping groups. The image quandle is injective. For $Q$ a finite quandle, we show that $G(Q)$ admits a faithfull representation $ρ: G(Q)\to GL_n(\mathbb{Z})$ for some $n$; an irreducible representation of $G(Q)$ over $\mathbb{C}$ is finite dimensional an its degree divides the order of the group $Inn(Q)$ of inner automorphism of $Q$ and is bounded by $\sqrt{\vert Inn(Q) \vert }$. We determine the Malcev Lie algebra and the rational cohomology ring of $G(Q)$ for $Q$ finite. We prove that a finite injective quandle is a subquandle (for conjugacy) of a finite group. We also prove that the only finite subquandles (for conjugacy) of uniquely divisible groups are trivial quandles and that morphisms from quandles to nilpotent groups (for conjugacy) are constant on the indecomposable components. Implication of these results are considered.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study the so-called {\it weakly $\sqrt{J}U$ rings} (hereafter abbreviated as {\it $W\sqrt{J}U$ rings} for short), in which every unit is of the form $j+1$ or $j-1$ for some $j$ in $\sqrt{J(R)} : = \{x \in R : x^n \in J(R) \text{ for some } n\ge 1\}$. This class of rings non-trivially generalizes the classes of $\sqrt{J}U$, $UU$, $JU$, $WUU$ and $WJU$ rings, respectively. We investigate their basic properties showing that they are Dedekind-finite, that $M_n(R)$ is never $W\sqrt{J}U$ for $n\ge 2$, and that when $\mathrm{char}(R)>0$ it must be equal to $2^α3^β$ for some $α, β\in \mathbb{N} \cup \left\{ 0 \right\}$. Moreover, for group rings $RG$, we prove that if $RG$ is $W\sqrt{J}U$, then $R$ is $W\sqrt{J}U$ and $G$ is a torsion group. In addition, when $R$ has positive characteristic and $G$ is a locally finite $p$-group, we give a complete characterization like this: $RG$ is a $W\sqrt{J}U$ ring if, and only if, either $R$ is a $\sqrt{J}U$ ring and $G$ is a $2$-group, or $R$ is a $W\sqrt{J}U$ ring with $3\in J(R)$ and $G$ is a $3$-group, or $R\cong R_1\times R_2$ with $R_1$ a $\sqrt{J}U$ ring, $R_2$ a $W\sqrt{J}U$ ring and $G$ a trivial group. Our results substantially improve on recent achievements due to Saini and Udar in Czech. Math. J. (2025).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study graded perfectoid rings as graded analogues of Scholze's (integral) perfectoid rings. We establish a categorical equivalence between graded perfectoid rings and graded perfect prisms, extending the Bhatt-Scholze's correspondence to the graded setting. We also construct the initial graded perfectoid cover of any graded semiperfectoid rings and prove a graded version of André's flatness lemma. These results lay the foundations for a graded theory of perfectoid rings.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 168 pages, 4 figures, Draft monograph / preprint

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The monograph develops a self-contained, mathematically rigorous framework for massless representations of the conformal group U(2,2) and their restriction to the de Sitter group Sp(2,2). It systematically constructs ladder (massless) representations, computes invariant bilinear forms and Casimir operators, and provides explicit constructions of vertex operators and two-point functions for low-helicity fields. The monograph employs a novel Clifford-split-octonion approach, embedding 8-component Majorana spinors within an alternative composition algebra, which allows for fully explicit algebraic, spinorial, and geometric constructions. The text bridges foundational representation theory, explicit computational methods, and physical applications in quantum field theory and cosmology. While targeted at researchers in mathematical physics, quantum cosmology, and quantum field theory, the exposition is pedagogically structured to guide advanced graduate students through subtle algebraic and representation-theoretic ideas, making complex constructions accessible without sacrificing rigor.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>While the value of the radius of convergence of the generating series of the Catalan numbers is well-known, obtaining it solely from recurrence relations is less immediate. It is sometimes considered that no known proof establishes that the radius $R$ equals 1/4 without relying on the explicit closed formula for the Catalan numbers. In particular, it has been shown that one can obtain, at the cost of substantial technical effort and without resorting to the main Segner recursion relation or to the explicit formula for the Catalan number, the lower bound $R\geq 1/6$. In this work, we prove that Touchard's recurrence alone yields the optimal exponential upper bound $\limsup_{n\to\infty} C_n^{1/n} \le 4$, which implies $R \ge 1/4$. Combined with the classical lower estimate $\limsup_{n\to\infty} C_n^{1/n} \ge 4$, obtained from central binomial coefficients, this gives $R = 1/4$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: cleverref issue solved

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Initiated in work by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten, the area known as $τ$-tilting theory plays a fundamental role in contemporary representation theory. In this paper we explore a higher-dimensional analogue of this theory, formulated with respect to the higher Auslander-Reiten translation $τ_d$. In particular, we associate to any functorially finite $d$-torsion class a maximal $τ_d$-rigid pair and a $(d+1)$-term silting complex. In the case $d=1$, the notions of maximal $τ_d$-rigid and support $τ$-tilting pairs coincide, and our theory recovers the classical bijections. However, the proof strategies for $d>1$ differ significantly. As an intermediate step, we prove that a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of a module category induces a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of the category of $(d+1)$-term complexes, producing novel examples of $d$-exact categories. We introduce the notion of a $d$-torsion class in the exact setup, and use this to obtain the aforementioned $(d+1)$-term silting complex. We moreover apply our theory to study $d$-APR tilting modules and slices. To illustrate our results, we provide explicit combinatorial descriptions of maximal $τ_d$-rigid pairs and $(d+1)$-term silting complexes for higher Auslander and higher Nakayama algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The equivalence classes of irreducible representations of wreath product $\mathfrak{S}_n(T) = T^n \rtimes \mathfrak{S}_n$ of finite group $T$ with respect to symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ are parametrized by $\mathbb{Y}_n(\widehat{T})$, the $\lvert \widehat{T}\rvert$-tuple Young diagrams with total size $n$. We show a formula connecting the Kerov transition measures of these Young diagrams with the Jucys--Murphy elements of $\mathfrak{S}_n(T)$. This formula is due to Biane in the case of symmetric groups. The formula enables us to investigate asymptotic property of the shapes of multi-diagrams through combinatorial analysis for the Jucys--Murphy elements. On the other hand, a Markov chain is introduced on $\mathbb{Y}_n(\widehat{T})$, canonically reflecting the branching rule for the tower of wreath product groups. We have a continuous time stochastic process on $\mathbb{Y}_n(\widehat{T})$ from this chain by replacing the discrete time by a counting process. Our project is to specify the deterministic limit shape of multi-diagrams at each macroscopic time through appropriate space-time scaling limit, and to describe evolution of related quantities characterizing the shape. Especially, we derive dynamical concentrated limit shapes in the case of abelian $T$ by using free probability tools under the assumption of approximate factorization property for initial ensembles with an additional property of a pausing time distribution.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In our previous paper with Tudor Pădurariu, we introduced the notion of limit categories for moduli stacks of Higgs bundles and formulated the Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence. These limit categories are expected to provide an effective ``classical limit'' of the categories of D-modules on the moduli stack of bundles, and our formulation links categorical Donaldson-Thomas theory with the geometric Langlands correspondence. In this paper, we prove the above Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ over the locus in the Hitchin base where the spectral curves are reduced. This is the first non-trivial case in which the relevant moduli stacks are not quasi-compact, and the use of limit categories is essential to the formulation and proof of the correspondence. Our approach also outlines a strategy for proving the correspondence in greater generality and explains the current obstructions to such an extension.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a Galois number field $K$, the Galois group $\text{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$ acts on the class group $Cl_K$ in a very natural way: $σ\cdot[I]=[σ(I)]$ for any $σ\in \text{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$, $[I]\in Cl_K$. In this paper, we will explore how the unique properties of this group action work together to elucidate the relationship between these two groups. While previous work on this problem has focused on representation theory, we take a direct approach to some classical and new problems. The paper concludes with an exploration of the class groups of overrings of the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$. These turn out to be powerful tools for understanding $Cl_K$ and overrings of $\mathcal{O}_K$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Include several non-trivial self-similar sets whose intersections with the $τ$-approximable set have the desired Hausdorff dimension

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K\subset\mathbb R^d$ be a compact subset equipped with a $δ$-Ahlfors regular measure $μ$. For any $τ>1/d$ and any ``inhomogeneous'' vector $\boldsymbolθ\in\mathbb R^d$, let $W_d(ψ_τ,\boldsymbolθ)$ denote the set of $(ψ_τ,\boldsymbolθ)$-well approximable numbers, where $ψ_τ(q)=q^{-τ}$. Assuming a local estimate for the $μ$-measure of the intersections of $K$ with the neighborhoods of ``rational'' vectors $(\mathbf p+\boldsymbolθ)/q$, we establish a sharp upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of $K\cap W_d(ψ_τ,\boldsymbolθ)$, together with some nontrivial lower bounds when $τ$ is below a certain threshold. One of the lower bounds becomes sharp in the one-dimensional homogeneous case ($d=1$, $θ=0$) for a class of sufficiently thick self-similar sets $K$, and moreover $K\cap W_1(ψ_τ,0)$ has full $(δ+\frac{2}{1+τ}-1)$-Hausdorff measure. These results have several applications: (1) the set of homogeneous very well approximable numbers has full Hausdorff dimension within strongly irreducible self-similar sets in $\mathbb R^d$, extending a recent result of Chen [arXiv:2510.17096]; (2) the set of inhomogeneous very well approximable numbers has full Hausdorff dimension within sufficiently thick missing digits sets in $\mathbb R$, affirmatively answering a question posed by Yu [arXiv:2101.05910]. Our applications build on the seminal works of Yu [arXiv:2101.05910] and Bénard, He and Zhang [arXiv:2508.09076]. We also provide some non-trivial missing digits set $K\subset[0,1]^d$ whose intersection with $W_d(ψ_τ,0)$ has full $(δ+\frac{1+d}{1+τ}-d)$-Hausdorff measure.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate bicomplex analogues of fundamental notions from classical algebraic number theory. In particular, we show that the primitive element theorem admits a natural generalization to bicomplex extensions, giving rise to two distinct classes of extensions depending on the nature of the generating element. We further establish a key decomposition property for bicomplex extensions, which serves as a foundation for studying their rings of integers. We also observe that prime elements in the ring of integers of a number field may become semiprime in the rings of integers of suitable bicomplex extensions. Finally, we present two explicit examples of finite bicomplex extensions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We explicitly describe the derived Picard groups of symmetric representation-finite algebras of type $D$. In particular, we prove that these groups are generated by spherical twists along collections of $0$-spherical objects, the shift and autoequivalences which come from outer automorphisms of a particular representative of the derived equivalence class. The arguments we use are based on the fact that symmetric representation-finite algebras are tilting-connected. To apply this result we in particular develop a combinatorial-geometric model for silting mutations in type $D$, generalising the classical concepts of Brauer trees and Kauer moves. Another key ingredient in the proof is the faithfulness of the braid group action via spherical twists along $D$-configurations of $0$-spherical objects.</p></details>

Moreover, the condition on the first digit of a representation for the value of the function is more general than conditions considered before. The main object of study is a continuous function defined by equality \begin{gather*} f(Δ^{s^*}_{α_1α_2\ldotsα_n\ldots}) = Δ^{2^*}_{β_1β_2\ldotsβ_n\ldots}, \quad α_n \in \{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots, s - 1 \} \equiv A_s, β_1 = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if $α_1 \in A_0$}, 1 & \text{if $α_1 \in A_1$}, \end{cases} \quad β_{n+1} = \begin{cases} β_n & \text{if $α_{n+1} = α_n$}, 1 - β_n & \text{if $α_{n+1} \neq α_n$}. \end{cases} \end{gather*} where $Δ^{s^*}_{α_1α_2\ldotsα_n\ldots}$ is an $s$-symbol representation of a number $x \in [0, 1]$ that is topologically equivalent to the classical $s$-adic representation, $Δ^{2^*}_{β_1β_2\ldotsβ_n\ldots}$ is a two-symbol representation that is topologically equivalent to the classical binary representation, and $A_0 \cup A_1 = A_s$, $A_0 \neq A_s \neq A_1$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** We corrected Remark 1.10 on the discontinuity of the joint map $(β, t)\to \dim_H K_β(t)$

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given $β\in(1,2]$, let $T_β$ be the $β$-transformation on the unit circle $[0,1)$ such that $T_β(x)=βx\pmod 1$. For each $t\in[0,1)$ let $K_β(t)$ be the survivor set consisting of all $x\in[0,1)$ whose orbit $\{T^n_β(x): n\ge 0\}$ never hits the open interval $(0,t)$. Kalle et al. proved in [Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems, 40 (9): 2482--2514, 2020] that the Hausdorff dimension function $t\mapsto\dim_H K_β(t)$ is a non-increasing Devil's staircase. So there exists a critical value $τ(β)$ such that $\dim_H K_β(t)>0$ if and only if $t<τ(β)$. In this paper we determine the critical value $τ(β)$ for all $β\in(1,2]$, answering a question of Kalle et al. (2020). For example, we find that for the Komornik-Loreti constant $β\approx 1.78723$ we have $τ(β)=(2-β)/(β-1)$. Furthermore, we show that (i) the function $τ: β\mapstoτ(β)$ is left continuous on $(1,2]$ with right-hand limits everywhere, but has countably infinitely many discontinuities; (ii) $τ$ has no downward jumps, with $τ(1+)=0$ and $τ(2)=1/2$; and (iii) there exists an open set $O\subset(1,2]$, whose complement $(1,2]\setminus O$ has zero Hausdorff dimension, such that $τ$ is real-analytic, convex and strictly decreasing on each connected component of $O$. Our strategy to find the critical value $τ(β)$ depends on certain substitutions of Farey words and a renormalization scheme from dynamical systems.</p></details>

This formalization is based on a recent approach of Harder-Narasimhan theory by Chen and Jeannin, which reinterprets the theory in order-theoretic terms and avoids the classical dependence on algebraic geometry. As an application, we formalize the uniqueness of coprimary filtration of a finitely generated module over a noetherian ring, and the existence of the Jordan-Hölder filtration of a semistable Harder-Narasimhan game.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In arXiv:2401.00636 we introduced the notion of a periodic pencil of flat connections on a smooth variety $X$. Namely, a pencil is a linear family of flat connections $\nabla(s_1,...,s_n)=d-\sum_{i=1}^r\sum_{j=1}^ns_jB_{ij}dx_i,$ where $\lbrace x_i\rbrace$ are coordinates on $X$ and $B_{ij}: X\to {\rm Mat}_N$ are matrix-valued regular functions. A pencil is periodic if it is generically invariant under the shifts $s_j\mapsto s_j+1$ up to isomorphism. In this paper we show that in characteristic $p>0$, the $p$-curvature operators $\lbrace C_i,1\le i\le r\rbrace$ of a periodic pencil $\nabla$ are isospectral to the commuting endomorphisms $C_i^*:=\sum_{j=1}^n (s_j-s_j^p)B_{ij}^{(1)}$, where $B_{ij}^{(1)}$ is the Frobenius twist of $B_{ij}$. Using the results of arXiv:2401.00636, this allows us to compute the eigenvalues of the $p$-curvature for many important examples of pencils of flat connections, including Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ), Casimir, and Dunkl connections, their confluent limits, and equivariant quantum connections for conical symplectic resolutions with finitely many torus fixed points. In particular, for rational values of parameters these eigenvalues are zero, so the connections are globally nilpotent. We also show that every periodic pencil has regular singularites and its residues have rational eigenvalues for rational values of parameters. In particular, this holds for the aforementioned quantum connections if they have rational coefficients. Also we generalize these results to irregular pencils (KZ, Casimir, Dunkl, and Toda), and relate them in the Dunkl case to representations of rational Cherednik algebras. Finally, we extend our main result to pseudo-pencils and discuss the generalization to difference equations.</p></details>

For $n\in \mathbb{N}$, let $$\mathcal{S}^{p/q}_{n}\ :=\ |\{F\subset\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\,:\, q\min F\ge p|F|\mbox{ and }n\in F\}|.$$ Using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, Beanland et al. proved the recurrence $$|\mathcal{S}^{p/q}_{n}|\ =\ \sum_{k=1}^q(-1)^{k+1}\binom{q}{k}|\mathcal{S}^{p/q}_{n-k}| + |\mathcal{S}^{p/q}_{n-(p+q)}|.$$ We show that $(|\mathcal{S}^{p/q}_n|)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a subsequence with terms taken periodically from Padovan-like sequences which satisfy simple recurrence relations. As an application, we obtain an alternative proof of the above linear recurrence. Furthermore, a similar result holds for the sequence $(|\mathcal{M}^{p/q}_{n}|)_{n=1}^\infty$ that counts maximal $(p,q)$-Schreier sets. We end with a discussion of the relation between $(|\mathcal{S}^{p/q}_{n}|)_{n=1}^\infty$ and $(|\mathcal{M}^{p/q}_{n}|)_{n=1}^\infty$.</p></details>

If ${\rm Tr}^E_F(y)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}σ^i y=0$, then the additive form of Hilbert's Theorem 90 asserts that $y=σx-x$ for some $x\in E$. When $E$ has characteristic $p>0$ we prove that $x$ gives rise to a periodic sequence $x_0,x_1,\dots$ which has period $pn_p$, where $n_p$ is the largest $p$-power that divides $n$. We also show, if $y$ lies in the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, then the roots of a reducible Artin-Schreier polynomial $t^p-t-y$ have the form $x+u$ where $u\in\mathbb{F}_p$ and $x=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}z^{p^j}y^{p^i}$ for some $z\in\mathbb{F}_{p^e}$ with $e=n_p$.

Our result can be viewed as a generalization of a well-known theorem of A. Borel that realizes the ring of invariant polynomials a Weyl group $W$ as a cohomology ring of the classifying space $BG$ of the associated Lie group $G$. In the present paper, we state our realization problem for the algebras of quasi-invariants of Weyl groups and give its solution in the rank one case (for $G = SU(2)$). We call the resulting $G$-spaces $ F_m(G,T) $ the $m$-quasi-flag manifolds and their Borel homotopy quotients $ X_m(G,T) $ the spaces of $m$-quasi-invariants. We compute the equivariant $K$-theory and the equivariant (complex analytic) elliptic cohomology of these spaces and identify them with exponential and elliptic quasi-invariants of $W$. We also extend our construction of spaces quasi-invariants to a certain class of finite loop spaces $ ΩB $ of homotopy type of $ S^3 $ originally introduced by D. L. Rector. We study the cochain spectra $ C^*(X_m,k) $ associated to the spaces of quasi-invariants and show that these are Gorenstein commutative ring spectra in the sense of Dwyer, Greenlees and Iyengar.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbf{Q}$ be a CM elliptic curve and let $p\geq 5$ be a prime of good ordinary reduction for $E$. Suppose that $L(E,s)$ vanishes at $s=1$ and has sign $+1$ in its functional equation, so in particular ${\rm ord}_{s=1}L(E,s)\geq 2$. In this paper we slightly modify a construction of Darmon--Rotger to define a generalised Kato class $κ_p\in{\rm Sel}(\mathbf{Q},V_pE)$, and prove the following rank two analogue of Kolyvagin's result: $$ κ_p\neq 0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad{\rm dim}_{\mathbf{Q}_p}{\rm Sel}(\mathbf{Q},V_pE)=2. $$ Conversely, when ${\rm dim}_{\mathbf{Q}_p}{\rm Sel}(\mathbf{Q},V_pE)=2$ we show that $κ_p\neq 0$ if and only if the restriction map $$ {\rm Sel}(\mathbf{Q},V_pE)\rightarrow E(\mathbf{Q}_p)\hat{\otimes}\mathbf{Q}_p $$ is nonzero. The proof of these results, which extend and strenghten similar results of the author with Hsieh in the non-CM case, exploit a new link between the nonvanishing of generalised Kato classes and a main conjecture in anticyclotomic Iwasawa theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the theory of inscribed $v$-sheaves, a differentiable extension of the theory of diamonds and $v$-sheaves with internal tangent bundles that are often relative inscribed Banach-Colmez spaces, then apply this theory to the study of $p$-adic periods. In particular, we construct natural inscribed versions of the Hodge and Hodge-Tate period maps and their lattice refinements for de Rham torsors, then compute the derivatives of these period maps in terms of classical structures in $p$-adic Hodge theory. These torsors include infinite level global Shimura varieties and infinite level local Shimura varieties, and for these spaces we also give another moduli-theoretic construction of the inscribed structure; the construction in the local Shimura case applies more generally to the non-minuscule moduli of mixed characterisic local shtukas with one leg. The key new ingredients in our study of inscribed structures on $p$-adic Lie group torsors over smooth rigid varieties over a $p$-adic field are the Liu-Zhu period map, a refinement of the Hodge period map whose derivative is the geometric Sen morphism/canonical Higgs field, and a closely related exact tensor functor from $\mathbb{Q}_p$-local systems to a category of twistor bundles on the relative thickened Fargues-Fontaine curve. These new structures are only visible after passing to the inscribed setting. We also discuss some possible implications of our computations in the vein of ``differential topology for diamonds."</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a Dirichlet series $D(F,G;s)$ attached to two automorphic forms $F$ and $G$ of an orthogonal group of real signature $(2,4)$, involving their Fourier--Jacobi coefficients. When $F$ is a Hecke eigenform and $G$ a lift of a Jacobi-Poincaré series, our main result gives that $D(F,G;s)$ is equal to the standard $L$-function attached to $F$, up to an explicit constant. To establish this, we use a correspondence between binary Hermitian forms and ideals of quaternion algebras, as established by Latimer, together with the fact that the even Clifford algebra of a three-dimensional definite quadratic space can be identified with a quaternion division algebra. Our work should be seen as a generalisation of a work of Kohnen and Skoruppa, whose result corresponds to the case of the orthogonal group of real signature $(2,3)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the pair correlations of the logarithms of the integral values of quadratic norm forms at various scalings, proving the existence of pair correlation measures. We describe a surprising set of asymptotic behaviours when the scaling increases, passing from a punctual measure to a Poissonian behaviour through an exotic behaviour at the transition phase.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a right-exactness theorem for the cross-effects of bifunctors, and consequently for cosmash products, in Janelidze-Márki-Tholen semi-abelian categories. This result motivates an intrinsic definition of a symmetric bilinear, actually bi-right exact and for varieties even bi-cocontinuous product, a tensor-like operation on objects of a category, constructed in terms of limits and colimits. Given two objects in the category, their bilinear product is the abelian object obtained as the cosmash product in the category of two-nilpotent objects of the reflections of these objects. In many concrete cases, this operation, applied to a pair of abelian objects, captures a classical tensor product. We explain this by proving a recognition theorem, which states that any symmetric, bi-cocontinuous bifunctor on an abelian variety of algebras can be recovered as the bilinear product within a suitable semi-abelian variety, namely of algebras over a certain 2-nilpotent symmetric operad. In other words, the extra structure carried by such a bifunctor on the abelian variety (for instance, a tensor product, known in the literature) is encoded by means of a surrounding semi-abelian variety whose abelian core is the original variety. We illustrate the construction with several examples, develop its basic properties, and compare it to the semi-abelian analogue of the Brown-Loday non-abelian tensor product. As an application, we present a categorical version of Ganea's six-term exact homology sequence. Finally, we characterise abelian extensions via internal action cores, yielding explicit descriptions of cosmash products and bilinear products in certain categories of representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal G\simeq H\rtimesΓ$ be the semidirect product of a finite group $H$ and $Γ\simeq\mathbb Z_p$. Let $ F/\mathbb Q_p$ be a finite extension with ring of integers $\mathcal O_F$. Then the total ring of quotients $\mathcal Q^F(\mathcal G)$ of the completed group ring $\mathcal O_F[[\mathcal G]]$ is semisimple artinian. We determine its Wedderburn decomposition in full generality in terms of the Wedderburn decomposition of the group ring $ F[H]$. Such a description was previously available only for those simple components for which a certain associated field extension is totally ramified.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Polynomial invariants of a group action often appear only in high degree, and in many representations the invariant ring imposes severe degree constraints before any nontrivial invariants can occur. In contrast, the larger class of unitary invariants -- polynomials in both the variables and their conjugates -- typically exhibits very different behavior, and their separating power is comparatively unexplored. We highlight this contrast in the setting of the finite Heisenberg group $H_N$. Although the polynomial invariant ring $\mathbb{C}[V]^{H_N}$ contains no nontrivial elements below degree $N$, we show that degree-six unitary invariants are already sufficient to separate generic $H_N$-orbits up to a global phase factor. These invariants arise from cubic equations involving the magnitudes of a vector and its discrete Fourier transform. A single polynomial invariant in degree $N$ then resolves the remaining global phase, yielding full generic orbit separation. Our proof utilizes fundamental results from phase retrieval. Along the way we will also explore the utility of unitary invariants in obtaining improved degree bounds for representations of cyclic groups. This paper provides a concrete example in which the minimal separating degree for unitary invariants is dramatically lower than the minimal degree for polynomial invariants.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the representation growth of split extensions of $SL_2^m(O)$. We prove that the corresponding representation zeta functions factor as a product of the representation zeta function of $SL_2^m(O)$ and the relative representation zeta function associated to the extension. We make use of our result by computing the zeta functions for two infinite families of split extensions of $SL_2^m(O)$ explicitly. Along the way, we compute the representation zeta functions of a large class of subgroups of $SL_2^m(O)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a $p$-adic group $G=\mathbf{G}(F)$ and a finite group $Γ\subset\mathrm{Aut}_F(\mathbf{G})$ such that the fixed-point subgroup $\mathbf{G}^Γ$ is reductive, we show that every semisimple character (in the sense of Bushnell and Kutzko) of a type for $G^Γ= \mathbf{G}^Γ(F)$ arises as the restriction of a semisimple character of a type for $G$. We achieve this by explicitly lifting the truncated Kim--Yu datum (or character-datum) that parametrizes the semisimple character for $G^Γ$ to a character-datum that parametrizes a semisimple character for $G$. Our proof, which is of independent interest, uses state-of-the-art techniques and, as a special case, defines a lift of a Howe factorization of a character of a maximal torus of $G^Γ$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a parametric supercongruence related to Whipple's ${}_5F_4$ formula and Dwork's dash operation. As a typical consequence, we obtain the following result: for any prime $p\equiv3\pmod4$ and odd integer $r\geq1$, $$ \sum_{k=0}^{p^r-1}(8k+1)\frac{(\frac14)_k^3(\frac12)_k}{(1)_k^3(\frac34)_k}\equiv 3p^r+\frac{27p^{3r}}{4}H_{(p^r-3)/4}^{(2)}\pmod{p^{r+3}}, $$ where $(x)_n=x(x+1)\cdots(x+n-1)$ is the Pochhammer symbol and $H_n^{(2)}=\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{k^2}$ is the $n$-th harmonic number of order $2$. This confirms a conjecture of Guo and Zhao [Forum Math. 38 (2026), 1099-1109]. Our proof rely on a new parametric WZ pair which allows us to transform the original sum to a computable form in the sense of congruence. Another essential ingredient of our proof involves the properties of Dwork's dash operation.</p></details>
