### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13462v2'>2309.13462</a>\]&nbsp; **Polishchuk's conjecture and Kazhdan-Laumon representations**

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In their 1988 paper "Gluing of perverse sheaves and discrete series representations," D. Kazhdan and G. Laumon constructed an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ associated to a reductive group $G$ over a finite field with the aim of using it to construct discrete series representations of the finite Chevalley group $G(\mathbb{F}_q)$. The well-definedness of their construction depended on their conjecture that this category has finite cohomological dimension. This was disproven by R. Bezrukavnikov and A. Polishchuk in 2001, who found a counterexample in the case $G = SL_3$. In the same paper, Polishchuk then made an alternative conjecture: though this counterexample shows that the Grothendieck group $K_0(\mathcal{A})$ is not spanned by objects of finite projective dimension, he noted that a graded version of $K_0(\mathcal{A})$ can be thought of as a module over Laurent polynomials and conjectured that a certain localization of this module is generated by objects of finite projective dimension, and suggested that this conjecture could lead toward a proof that Kazhdan and Laumon's construction is well-defined. He proved this conjecture in Types $A_1, A_2, A_3$, and $B_2$. In the present paper, we prove Polishchuk's conjecture in full generality, and go on to prove that Kazhdan and Laumon's construction is indeed well-defined, giving a new geometric construction of discrete series representations of $G(\mathbb{F}_q)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The main aim of this paper is to investigate Greenberg's conjecture for real biquadratic fields. More precisely, we propose the following problem: What are real biquadratic number fields $k$ such that ${\rm rank}(A(k_\infty)) = {\rm rank}(A(k_1))$?, where $A(k_\infty)$ is the $2$-Iwasawa module of $k$ and $A(k_1)$ is the $2$-class group of $k_1$ the first layer of the cyclotomic $\mathbb Z_2$-extension of $k$. Moreover, we give several families of real biquadratic fields $k$ such that $A(k_\infty)$ is trivial or isomorphic to $\mathbb Z/2^{n} \mathbb Z$ or $\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z \times\mathbb Z/2^n \mathbb Z$, where $n$ is a given positive integer. The reader can also find some results concerning the $2$-rank of the class group of certain real triquadratic fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct an analogue of Gerasimov-Kharchev-Lebedev-Oblezin (GKLO) representations for twisted Yangians of type $\mathsf{AI}$, using the recently found current presentation of these algebras due to Lu, Wang and Zhang. These new representations allow us to define interesting truncations of twisted Yangians, which, in the spirit of Ciccoli-Drinfeld-Gavarini quantum duality, reflect the Poisson geometry of homogeneous spaces. As our main result, we prove that a truncated twisted Yangian quantizes a scheme supported on quotients of transverse slices in the affine Grassmannian.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We classify semistable abelian varieties over $\mathbb{Q}$ with bad reduction at exactly 19 up to isogeny over $\mathbb{Q}$. The general strategy goes back to Fontaine and has been heavily refined by Schoof. In the beginning of this paper we include an overview of this strategy, proving various non-trivial background results along the way, as an introduction for readers unacquainted with this topic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present families of generators with minimal cardinality - we call such families bases - of the free abelian group $\mathrm{Was}(\mathbb{K}) / \mathbf{Z}(\mathbb{K})$ for any real cyclotomic field $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)^{+}$. If $\mathbb{K}$ is a totally deployed abelian number field, we give a $\mathbb{Z} [1/2]$-basis of $\mathrm{Was}(\mathbb{K}) / \mathbf{Z}(\mathbb{K}) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \mathbb{Z} [1/2]$. Here, $\mathrm{Was}(\mathbb{K})$ refers to the group of Washington's cyclotomic units of $\mathbb{K}$ and $\mathbf{Z}(\mathbb{K})$ refers to the group of roots of unity lying in $\mathbb{K}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K/E/\mathbb{Q}_p$ be a tower of finite extensions with $E$ Galois. We relate the category of $G_K$-equivariant vector bundles on the Fargues--Fontaine curve with coefficients in $E$ with $E$-$G_K$-$B$-pairs and describe crystalline and de Rham objects in explicit terms. When $E$ is a proper extension, we give a new description of the category in terms of compatible tuples of $\mathbf{B}_e$-modules, which allows us to compute Galois cohomology in terms of an explicit \v{C}ech complex which can serve as a replacement of the fundamental exact sequence.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study irreducibility of Galois representations $\rho_{\pi,\lambda}$ associated to a $n=7$ or 8-dimensional regular algebraic essentially self-dual cuspidal automorphic representation $\pi$ of $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q})$. We show $\rho_{\pi,\lambda}$ is irreducible for all but finitely many $\lambda$ under the following extra conditions. (i) If $n=7$, and there exists no $\lambda$ such that the Lie type of $\rho_{\pi,\lambda}$ is the standard representation of exceptional group $\textbf{G}_2$. (ii) If $n=8$, and when there exist infinitely many $\lambda$ such that the Lie type of $\rho_{\pi,\lambda}$ is the spin representation of $\text{SO}_7$, we assume there exist no three distinct Hodge-Tate weights form a 3-term arithmetic progression.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Victor Buchstaber, Mikhail Kornev &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** In this version, Theorem 2 and its proof have been corrected

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The article presents results on the well-known problem concerning the structure of integer polynomials $p_n(z; x, y)$, which define multiplication laws in $n$-valued groups $\mathbb{G}_n$ over the field of complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$. We show that the $n$-valued multiplication in the group $\mathbb{G}_n$ is realized in terms of the eigenvalues of the Kronecker sum of companion Frobenius matrices for polynomials of the form $t^n - x$ in the variable $t$. The notion of a Wendt $(x, y, z)$-matrix is introduced. When $x = (-1)^n$, $y = z = 1$, one recovers the classical Wendt matrix, whose determinant is used in number theory in connection with Fermat's Last Theorem. It is shown that for each positive integer $n$, the polynomial $p_n$ is given by the determinant of a Wendt $(x, y, z)$-matrix. Iterations of the $n$-valued multiplication in the group $\mathbb{G}_n$ lead to polynomials $p_n(z; x_1, \dots, x_m)$. We prove the irreducibility of the polynomial $p_n(z; x_1, \dots, x_m)$ over various fields. For each $n$, we introduce the notion of classes of symmetric $n$-algebraic $n$-valued groups. The group $\mathbb{G}_n$ belongs to one of these classes. For $n = 2, 3$, a description of the universal objects of these classes is obtained.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Weixiao Lu, Guodong Xi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the automorphic period associated to a $G$-Hamiltonian variety $M$ whose dual is $\check{M} = T^*(\check{G}/\check{L})$, where $\check{G}$ is a general linear group and $\check{L}$ is a Levi subgroup. For certain cuspidal Eisenstein series, we prove that their period is equal to a finite sum of special values of $L$-functions. This sum is indexed by the fixed points of the associated extended $L$-parameter on $\check{M}$, confirming a conjecture by Ben-Zvi-Sakellaridis-Venkatesh in this case.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 41 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The main result of this paper is that there is an additive equivalence between $\overline{\mathcal{C}}_n$, the Paquette-Yildirim completion of the discrete cluster categories of Dynkin type $A_{\infty}$, and the perfect derived category of a certain DG algebra. This additive equivalence preserves some of the triangulated structure: it commutes with the suspension functor and preserves triangles with at least two indecomposable terms. In the process, we introduce the notion of a linear generator $G$ in a Krull-Schmidt, Hom-finite triangulated category. It turns out that the existence of a linear generator affords a large amount of control over $\mathcal{T}$. For example, it allows us to describe all indecomposable objects in $\mathcal{T}$ in terms of $G$, to determine all triangles of $\mathcal{T}$ with at least two indecomposable objects, and to show that the Rouquier dimension of $\mathcal{T}$ is at most one. Moreover, we prove that there is an additive equivalence (which preserves some of the triangulated structure) between $\mathcal{T}$ and the perfect derived category of a certain DG algebra. Finally, we show that any triangulated category with a linear generator is additively equivalent to a thick subcategory of $\overline{\mathcal{C}}_n$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ryosuke Ooe &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the rationality of the characteristic form for a degree one character of the Galois group of an abelian extension of henselian discrete valuation fields. We prove the integrality of the characteristic form for a rank one sheaf on a regular excellent scheme. These properties are shown by reducing to the corresponding properties of the refined Swan conductor proved by Kato. We define the F-characteristic cycle of a rank one sheaf on an arithmetic surface as a cycle on the FW-cotangent bundle using the characteristic form on the basis of the computation of the characteristic cycle in the equal characteristic case by Yatagawa. The rationality and the integrality of the characteristic form are necessary for the definition of the F-characteristic cycle. We prove the intersection of the F-characteristic cycle with the 0-section computes the Swan conductor of cohomology of the generic fiber.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 47 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we give the upper bounds on the variance for cubic moment of Hecke--Maass cusp forms and Eisenstein series respectively. For the cusp form case, the bound comes from a large sieve inequality for symmetric cubes. We also give some nontrivial bounds for higher moments of symmetric cube $L$-functions. For the Eisenstein series case, the upper bound comes from Lindel\"of-on-average type bounds for various $L$-functions. In particular, we establish the sharp upper bounds for the fourth moment of $\mathrm{GL}(2)\times \mathrm{GL}(2)$ $L$-functions and the eighth moment of $\mathrm{GL}(2)$ $L$-functions around special points $1/2+it_j$. Our proof is based on the work of Chandee and Li \cite{C-L20} about bounding the second moment of $\mathrm{GL}(4)\times \mathrm{GL}(2)$ $L$-functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $r$ be an odd prime and $\mathbb{F}$ a field containing a primitive $r$th root of unity. Then for all $\ell \geq 1$, there is a faithful representation $f: \mathrm{Sp}_{2\ell}(r) \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}_{r^\ell}(\mathbb{F})$ called the Weil representation. We provide explicit matrices generating $\mathrm{Sp}_{2\ell}(r)$ in $\mathrm{GL}_{r^\ell}(\mathbb{F})$, which we have implemented in Magma. We also describe such generators for the irreducible Weil representations of $\mathrm{Sp}_{2\ell}(r)$, which are of degree $(r^{\ell} \pm 1)/2$ and arise as irreducible constituents of the Weil representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this chapter, we want to have an overview of the Taylor--Wiles patching method. For this purpose, at the first, we recall Mazur's theory of deforming Galois representations and study both local and global deformation problems. Then, we go through the subject of Taylor-Wiles primes and examine the role that they play on the Galois side and the modular (automorphic) side. At the end, we arrive at the Taylor-Wiles patching method and use it to prove $R=\mathbb{T}$ in both minimal and non-minimal cases. Note that, in the Galois side, we will work with totally real number fields, but for the modular side, we will concentrate on $\mathbb{Q}$ to avoid difficulties of working with Hilbert modular forms.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 40 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the canonical basis of a modified quantum group $\dot{\mathbf{U}}$ exhibits strong positivity properties for the canonical basis elements arising from spherical parabolic subalgebras. Our main result establishes that the structure constants for both the multiplication with arbitrary canonical basis elements in $\dot{\mathbf{U}}$ and the action on the canonical basis elements of arbitrary tensor products of simple lowest and highest weight modules by these elements belong to $\mathbb{N}[v,v^{-1}]$. This implies, in particular, for quantum groups of finite type, the structure constants for multiplication and for action on tensor product with respect to canonical basis are governed by positive coefficients. A key ingredient is the thickening construction, an algebraic technique that embeds a suitable approximation of the tensor of a lowest weight module and a highest weight module of $\dot{\mathbf{U}}$ into the negative part $\tilde{\mathbf{U}}^-$ of a larger quantum group. This allows us to inherit the desired positivity for the tensor product from the well-established positivity of the canonical basis of $\tilde{\mathbf{U}}^-$.</p></details>

The classification is connected to equivariant Poisson structures on compact full flag manifolds in the operator-algebraic setting, and on semisimple coadjoint orbits in the algebraic setting. We also provide an explicit construction based on the BGG categories of deformed quantum enveloping algebras, whose unitarizability corresponds to being of quotient type. Finally, we present a brief discussion of the non-quantum case.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yang Zhang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $S(a,b;n)$ be the Kloosterman sum. For any integers $a\neq0,b\neq0,k\geqslant2$, any given complex number $\eta\not=0$ and multiplicative function $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, we show that $$ |\{n\leqslant X:S(a,b;n)=\eta f(n), n \text{ square-free }k\text{-almost prime}\}|\leqslant \pi(\dfrac{X}{L_k})+O(X^{1-\frac{1}{2k}}) $$ and $$ |\{n\leqslant X:S(a,b;n)=\eta f(n), n \text{ square-free}\}|\leqslant \pi(X)+O(Xe^{-\sqrt{\log X}}) $$ as $X\rightarrow \infty$. Here, $L_{k}$ denotes the product of the first $(k-1)$ primes and $\pi(X)$ is the number of primes $\leqslant X$. By providing some examples for which the equality holds, we also prove that these two inequalities are sharp. In particular, these estimates imply that $S(a,b;n)\neq\eta f(n)$ holds for $100\%$ square-free $k$-almost prime numbers and $100\%$ square-free numbers $n$. Counterintuitively, if $S(a,b;p)=\eta f(p)$ holds for all but finitely many primes $p$, we further show that \begin{align*} |\{n\leqslant X:S(a,b;n)=\eta f(n), n \text{ square-free }k\text{-almost prime}\}|\leqslant (|a|+|b|+2k)X^{\frac{k}{k+1}}+O(1). \end{align*} All these demonstrate that $S(a,b;n)$ with fixed $a\neq0$ and $b\neq0$, as an arithmetic function of $n\in\mathbb{N}$ is intrinsically distinct from any complex valued multiplicative function. Similarly, we also show that all these results still hold with the Birch sum $B(a,b;n)$ or the Sali\'e sum $\widetilde{S}(a,b;n)$ in place of $S(a,b;n)$ if and only if the integer pair $a,b$ satisfies some natural conditions respectively.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a number field and $f: \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^1$ a rational map of degree $d \geq 2$ with at most $s$ places of bad reduction, where we include all archimedean places. We prove that there exists constants $c_1,c_2 > 0$, depending only on $d$ and not on $f$ or $K$, such that $$ \# \left\{ x \in \mathbb{P}^1(K) \mid \widehat{h}_f(x) \leq \frac{c_1}{s} h_{\mathrm{rat}_d}(\langle f \rangle) \right\} \leq c_2 s \log(s). $$ Here, $\mathrm{rat}_d$ is the moduli space of rational maps up to conjugacy, $h_{\mathrm{rat}_d}$ is an ample height and $\langle f \rangle$ is the equivalence class associated to $f$. This gives a uniform version of a theorem of Baker as well as generalizing the results of Benedetto and Looper from polynomials to rational maps. The main tool used is the degeneration of sequences of rational maps by Luo which has been recently formalized by Favre-Gong via Berkovich spaces.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 48 pages, 33 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Webs are a kind of planar, directed, edge-labeled graph that encode invariant vectors for quantum representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$. The theory of webs developed organically for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, where they are also known as noncrossing matchings and the Temperley-Lieb algebra, before being formalized by Kuperberg for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ as the morphisms in a diagrammatic categorification of quantum representations called the spider category. Various models extend webs to $n \geq 4$. Only Cautis-Kamnitzer-Morrison prove a full set of relations for their webs, though Fontaine's webs are better adapted to computations, more graph-theoretically natural, and directly generalize webs for $n=2$ and $n=3$. This paper formalizes the theory of Fontaine's webs, proving the existence of a deep and powerful global structure on these webs called strandings. We do three key things: 1) give a state-sum formula to construct ($U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_n)$-invariant) web vectors from the orientation of strandings on Fontaine's webs; 2) list and prove a complete set of relations, connecting strandings to the local data of binary labelings that are well-established in the literature; and 3) provide applications and examples of how strandings facilitate computations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In \cite{Broer1993}, it was shown that certain line bundles on $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}}=T^*G/B$ have vanishing higher cohomology. We prove a generalization of this theorem for real reductive algebraic groups. More specifically, if $\mathcal{N}_\theta$ denotes the cone of nilpotent elements in a Cartan subspace $\mathfrak{p},$ we have a similar construction of a resolution of singularities $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}.$ We prove that for a certain cone of weights $H^i(\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta},\mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}}(\lambda))=0$ for $i> 0.$ This follows by combining a simple calculation of the canonical bundle for $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}$ with Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing. Restricting to the structure sheaf, we get a characterization of the singularities of the normalization of $\mathcal{N}_\theta.$ We use this to show that for groups of QCT (Definition 2), $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{N}_\theta]$ is equivalent as a $K$-representation to a certain cohomologically induced module giving a new proof of a result in \cite{KostantRallis1971}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Index Conjecture in zero-sum theory states that when $n$ is coprime to $6$ and $k$ equals $4$, every minimal zero-sum sequence of length $k$ modulo $n$ has index $1$. While other values of $(k,n)$ have been studied thoroughly in the last 30 years, it is only recently that the conjecture has been proven for $n>10^{20}$. In this paper, we prove that said upper bound can be reduced to $4.6\cdot10^{13}$, and lower under certain coprimality conditions. Further, we verify the conjecture for $n<1.8\cdot10^6$ through the application of High Performance Computing (HPC).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We classify the elementary classical and quantum Lifshitz systems. Lifshitz systems are systems where space and time scale anisotropically. That is, there is a constant $z$ such that under scaling by a factor of $\lambda$, \begin{equation*} \boldsymbol{x}\rightarrow \lambda \boldsymbol{x} \text{ and } t\rightarrow \lambda^{z}t \end{equation*} There are seven Lie groups, called the Lifshitz groups, which characterise all Lifshitz symmetries. Elementary classical Lifshitz systems are the symplectic manifolds with a transitive Lifshitz action, which turn out to be coadjoint orbits of the Lifshitz groups and their one-dimensional central extensions up to covering. Elementary quantum Lifshitz systems are the projective unitary irreducible representations of the Lifshitz groups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By a theorem of Edrei, an infinite, normalised totally nonnegative upper-triangular Toeplitz matrix is determined by a pair of nonnegative parameter sequences, the `Schoenberg parameters', where nonzero parameters correspond to the roots and poles of a naturally associated generating function. These totally nonnegative Toeplitz matrices and their parameters also arise in the classification of characters of the infinite symmetric group by later work of Thoma. Moreover the Schoenberg parameters have an asymptotic interpretation in terms of irreducible representations of S_n and their Young diagrams by Vershik-Kerov. In this article we consider infinite totally positive Toeplitz matrices as limits of finite ones, and we obtain two further asymptotic descriptions of the Schoenberg parameters that are now related to quantum cohomology of the flag variety as n goes to infinity. One is related to asymptotics of normalised quantum parameters, and the other to asymptotics of the Chern classes of the tautological line bundles. We also describe the asymptotics of (quantum) Schubert classes in terms of the Schoenberg parameters. Our limit formulas relate to and were motivated by a tropical analogue of this theory that we survey. In the tropical setting one finds an asymptotic relationship between the `tropical Schoenberg parameters' and the weight map from Lusztig's parametrisation of the canonical basis.</p></details>

Here we study the case where $f:\CX\rightarrow S$ is a family of elliptic curves. We construct relations among the values of G-functions in this setting at points whose fiber is a CM elliptic curve.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Inspired by constructions over the complex numbers of Dolgachev and Alexeev-Engel, we define moduli stacks $\mathcal{M}_{(L,\mathcal{A})/\mathbb{Z}}$ of lattice-polarized K3 surfaces over arbitrary bases, paying particular attention to the open locus $\mathcal{P}_{(L,\mathcal{A})/\mathbb{Z}}$ of primitive lattice polarizations. We introduce the notion of very small ample cones $\mathcal{a}$, after Alexeev and Engel's small cones, to construct smooth, separated stacks of lattice polarized K3 surfaces $\mathcal{P}_{(L,\mathcal{a})/\mathbb{Z}[1/N]}$ over suitable open subsets of $\textrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$. We add level structures, coming from classes in $\mathrm{H}^2(X,\mu_n)$, to build moduli stacks $\mathcal{P}^{[n]}_{(L,\mathcal{A})/\mathbb{Z}}$ with a natural action by $\mathcal{P}_{(L,\mathcal{A})}\otimes \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ whose associated quotient $\mathcal{Q}^{[n]}_{(L,\mathcal{A})}$ contains an open substack $\mathcal{Q}^{(n)}_{(L,\mathcal{A})}$ whose points parametrize pairs K3 surfaces $X$ such that $\textrm{Pic}(X) \simeq L$, together with a class $\alpha \in \textrm{Br}(X)$ of order $n$. When $L$ has rank 19, we show that the coarse moduli space $\mathrm{Q}_{(L,\mathcal{a}),\mathbb{C}}^{(n)}$ is a union of quasi-projective curves, each isomorphic to an open subvariety of the quotient of the upper half plane by a discrete subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$. Fixing a prime $\ell$, we use this comparison to prove that the genus and the gonality of the components of $\mathrm{Q}_{(L,\mathcal{a}),\mathbb{C}}^{(\ell^{m})}$ grows with $m$, and hence that they have finitely many points over number fields of bounded degree. As an application, we furnish a new proof of a result by Cadoret--Charles, showing uniform boundedness of the $\ell$-primary torsion of Brauer groups of K3 surfaces over number fields varying in a $1$-dimensional lattice-polarized family.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article establishes a geometric Satake equivalence for affine Kac-Moody groups as an equivalence of abelian semisimple categories over algebraically closed fields. We define a well-behaved category of equivariant sheaves on the double affine grassmannian \Gr_{G}, seen as a infty-stack, that we equip with a t-structure. We obtain an Braden's hyperbolic localization theorem for such a stack and prove that the constant term functor is t-exact using dimension estimates for affine MV-cycles. We then deduce the sought-for equivalence and prove that the IC-complexes match with the irreducible highest weight representations of the Langlands dual group G^{\vee}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the rank-4 case of the conjecture of Ha-Hai-Nghia for the invariant subspace of the truncated polynomial ring $\mathcal{Q}_m(n)=\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dots,x_n]/(x_1^{q^m},\dots,x_n^{q^m}),$ under a new, explicit technical hypothesis. Our argument extends the determinant calculus for the delta operator by deriving crucial rank-4 identities governing its interaction with the Dickson algebra. We show that the proof of the conjecture reduces to a specific vanishing property, for which we introduce a sufficient condition, the "matching hypothesis" H$_{\mathrm{match}}$}, relating the degree structures of Dickson invariants. This condition is justified by theoretical arguments and verified computationally in many cases. Combining this approach with the normalized derivation approach from our prior work, we establish the conjecture. As a result, the Lewis-Reiner-Stanton Conjecture is also confirmed for rank four under the given hypothesis.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite group, it is interesting to determine when two ordinary irreducible representations have the same $p$-modular reduction; that is, when two rows of the decomposition matrix in characteristic $p$ are equal, or equivalently when the corresponding $p$-modular Brauer characters are the same. We complete this task for the double covers of the symmetric group when $p=2$, by determining when the $2$-modular reduction of an irreducible spin representation coincides with a $2$-modular Specht module. In fact, we obtain a more general result: we determine when an irreducible spin representation has $2$-modular Brauer character proportional to that of a Specht module. In the course of the proof, we use induction and restriction functors to construct a function on generalised characters which has the effect of swapping runners in abacus displays for the labelling partitions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X$ be a smooth projective and geometrically irreducible curve over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ elements and $K$ be its function field. Let $\infty$ be a fixed closed point on $X$ and $A$ be the ring of functions regular away from $\infty$. In the present paper, by generalizing the previous work of Chen and the first author, we introduce the notion of nearly holomorphic Drinfeld modular forms for congruence subgroups of $GL_2(K)$ as continuous but non-holomorphic functions on a certain subdomain of the Drinfeld upper half plane. By extending the de Rham sheaf to a compactification $\overline{M_I^2}$ of the Drinfeld moduli space $M_I^2$, we also describe such forms algebraically as global sections of an explicitly described sheaf on $\overline{M_I^2}$ as well as construct a comparison isomorphism between analytic and algebraic description of them. Furthermore, we show the transcendence of special values of nearly holomorphic Drinfeld modular forms at CM points and relate them to the periods of CM Drinfeld $A$-modules.</p></details>

We analyse the problem in terms of the hitting time and impact statistics for the unipotent action with respect to a shrinking surface of section, following the strategy of Pollicott and the first named author in the case of hyperbolic surfaces.

We establish a close relationship between the strong generation of the singularity category of R and the nonvanishing of the annihilator of the singularity category of R. As an application, we prove that the singularity category of R has a strong generator if and only if the annihilator of the singularity category of R is nonzero when R is a Noetherian domain with Krull dimension at most one. We introduce the notion of the co-cohomological annihilator of modules. If the category of finitely generated R-modules has a strong generator, we show that the infinite injective dimension locus of a finitely generated R-module M is closed, with the defining ideal given by the co-cohomological annihilator of M. Finally, we provide a connection between the existence of an extension generator of the category of finitely generated R-modules and the finiteness of the Krull dimension of R.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Interpolation polynomials were introduced by Knop--Sahi in type $A$, and Okounkov in type $BC$. They are inhomogeneous polynomials whose top terms are Jack and Macdonald polynomials. Thus the expansion coefficients for the product of two interpolation polynomials, known as Littlewood--Richardson coefficients, generalize the corresponding coefficients for Jack/Macdonald polynomials. Special values of interpolation polynomials, known as binomial coefficients, arise in the binomial type expansions of Jack/Macdonald polynomials and Koornwinder polynomials. We prove a number of results for interpolation polynomials and the associated coefficients. These include positivity and monotonicity results for binomial coefficients, partial positivity results for Littlewood--Richardson coefficients, and weighted sum formulas for both kinds of coefficients. As a special case of our results we obtain a new symmetric function inequality, which establishes a ``duality'' between Jack expansion positivity for symmetric functions, and the containment order on partitions, with respect to the shifted basis $\Omega_\lambda({\bf1}+x;\tau)$, where ${\bf1} =(1,\ldots,1)$ and $\Omega_\lambda(x;\tau)=P_\lambda(x;\tau)/P_\lambda({\bf1};\tau)$ is the normalized Jack polynomial. Our inequality can be seen as an analog of the inequalities of Cuttler--Greene--Skandera+Sra and Khare--Tao, which establish similar dualities between evaluation positivity on the positive orthant, and the dominance and weak dominance orders on partitions, with respect to the normalized Schur basis $\Omega_\lambda(x)=s_\lambda(x)/s_\lambda({\bf1})$ and its shifted version $\Omega_\lambda({\bf1}+x)$, respectively. In contrast to our result, the Jack versions of the two latter inequalities, although expected to hold, have not yet been proved.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 30 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In number theory, many major results related to the twin prime and Goldbach conjectures are proven using the methods of sieve theory. However, in nearly every case, the existing proofs of these results are ineffective, in that explicit values for which they hold cannot be computed. The reason for this ineffectivity is due to the reliance on the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem. In this paper, we show that any classical sifting problem with a Bombieri-Vinogradov style error term can in fact be made effective, with no loss to the asymptotic form of the original (ineffective) result. This is done by carefully modifying the sieve upper and lower bounds as to avoid the usual complications regarding the existence of a Siegel zero. We also provide some simple applications. For example, we show that one may effectively bound the number of primes $p\leq x$ such that $p+2$ is also prime by \begin{equation*} (4+o(1))C_2\frac{x}{(\log x)^2}, \end{equation*} where \begin{equation*} C_2=2\prod_{p>2}\left(1-\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\right) \end{equation*} is the twin-prime constant.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a small, connected category with finite hom-sets. We show that if the embedding of a connected subcategory $\mathcal{J}$ is both initial and final, then the restriction of any $\mathcal{C}$-module along $\mathcal{J}$ preserves the generalized rank-or equivalently, the multiplicity of the ``entire" interval modules for $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{J}$. Conversely, we prove that this property characterizes initial and final embeddings when both $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{J}$ are posets satisfying certain mild constraints and the embedding is full. For $\mathcal{C}$ a poset under these conditions, we describe the minimal full subposet whose embedding is initial or final. We also extend a result of Kinser on the generalized rank invariant to small categories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe the obstruction to decomposing in degrees $\leq p$ the de Rham complex of a smooth variety over a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p$ that lifts over $W_2(k)$, and show that there exist liftable smooth projective varieties of dimension $p+1$ whose Hodge-to-de Rham spectral sequence does not degenerate at the first page. We also describe the action of the Sen operator on the de Rham complex in degrees $\leq p$ and give examples of varieties with a non-semisimple Sen operator. Our methods rely on the commutative algebra structure on de Rham and Hodge-Tate cohomology, and are inspired by the properties of Steenrod operations on cohomology of cosimplicial commutative algebras. The example of a non-degenerate Hodge-to-de Rham spectral sequence relies on a non-vanishing result on cohomology of groups of Lie type. We give applications to other situations such as describing extensions in the canonical filtration on de Rham, Hodge, and \'etale cohomology of an abelian variety equipped with a group action. We also show that the de Rham complex of a smooth variety over $k$ is formal as an $E_{\infty}$-algebra if and only if the variety lifts to $W_2(k)$ together with its Frobenius endomorphism.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical fiber product in algebraic geometry provides a powerful tool for studying loci where two morphisms to a base scheme, $\phi: X \to S$ and $\psi: Y \to S$, coincide exactly. This condition of strict equality, however, is insufficient for describing many real-world applications. This paper develops a new framework to study and quantify the nature of approximate alignment between morphisms in the context of arithmetic geometry, using the tools of {\'e}tale homotopy theory. We introduce the central object of our work, the \textit{{\'e}tale mismatch torsor}, a sheaf of torsors over the product scheme $X \times_S Y$. The structure of this sheaf serves as a rich, intrinsic, and purely algebraic object amenable to both qualitative classification and quantitative analysis of the global relationship between the two morphisms. Our main results are twofold. First, we provide a complete classification of these structures, establishing a bijection between their isomorphism classes and the first {\'e}tale cohomology group $H_{\text{\'e}t}^1(X \times_S Y, \underline{\pi_1^{\text{\'e}t}(S)})$. Second, we construct a canonical filtration on this classifying cohomology group based on the theory of infinitesimal neighborhoods. This filtration induces a new invariant, which we term the \textit{order of mismatch}, providing a hierarchical, algebraic measure for the degree of approximation between the morphisms. We apply this framework to the concrete case of generalized Howe curves over finite fields, demonstrating how both the characteristic class and its order reveal subtle arithmetic properties.</p></details>

We also noticed that for such number fields, when the Hilbert class field is an abelian extension of $\mathbb{Q}$, we can get a better bound towards the $\ell-$torsion conjecture.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates the exponential Diophantine equation of the form $a^x+b=c^y$, where $a, b, c$ are given positive integers with $a,c \ge 2$, and $x,y$ are positive integer unknowns. We define this form as a "Type-I transcendental diophantine equation." A general solution to this problem remains an open question; however, the ABC conjecture implies that the number of solutions for any such equation is finite. This work introduces and implements an effective algorithm designed to solve these equations. The method first computes a strict upper bound for potential solutions given the parameters $(a, b, c)$ and then identifies all solutions via finite enumeration. While the universal termination of this algorithm is not theoretically guaranteed, its heuristic-based design has proven effective and reliable in large-scale numerical experiments. Crucially, for each instance it successfully solves, the algorithm is capable of generating a rigorous mathematical proof of the solution's completeness.</p></details>

In type AI with $\mu$ dominant, a variant of ${}^\imath Y_\mu^{N\varpi_1^\vee}$ is identified with the TSTY in another definition which are isomorphic to finite W-algebras of type BCD. We show that ${}^\imath Y_\mu$ quantizes the involutive fixed point locus ${}^\imath W_\mu$ arising from affine Grassmannians of type ADE, and expect that ${}^\imath Y_\mu^\lambda$ quantizes a top-dimensional component of the affine Grassmannian islice ${}^\imath{\bar{W}}_\mu^\lambda$. We identify the islices ${}^\imath{\bar{W}}_\mu^\lambda$ in type AI with suitable nilpotent Slodowy slices of type BCD, building on the work of Lusztig and Mirkovi\'c-Vybornov in type A. We propose a framework for producing ortho-symplectic (and hybrid) Coulomb branches from split (and nonsplit) Satake framed double quivers, which are conjectured to provide a normalization of the islices ${}^\imath{\bar{W}}_\mu^\lambda$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Countably generated projective modules that are relatively big with respect to a trace ideal were introduced by P. P\v{r}\'ihoda, as an extension of Bass' uniformly big projectives. It has already been proved that there are a number of interesting examples of rings whose countably generated projective modules are always relatively big. In this paper, we increase the list of such examples, showing that it includes all right noetherian rings satisfying a polynomial identity. We also show that countably generated projective modules over locally semiperfect torsion-free algebras over $h$-local domains are always relatively big. This last result applies to endomorphism rings of finitely generated torsion-free modules over $h$-local domains. As a consequence, we can give a complete characterization of those $h$-local domains of Krull dimension $1$ for which every direct summand of a direct sum of copies of a single finitely generated torsion-free module is again a direct sum of finitely generated modules.</p></details>

This is analogous to a known fact about the topological fundamental group of an open subset of a normal complex analytic variety. We use this result to show that simply connected, proper, normal varieties in positive characteristic admit no nontrivial $F$-divided bundles. This generalizes an earlier result of H. Esnault and V.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, the second Kronecker ``limit" formula for a real quadratic field is established for the first time. More precisely, we obtain the second Kronecker limit formula of Zagier's zeta function. Using the reduction theory of Zagier, which connects Zagier's zeta function to the zeta function of real quadratic fields, we express the values of the zeta function of narrow ideal classes in real quadratic fields at natural arguments in terms of an analytic function which we call the \emph{higher Herglotz-Zagier-Novikov function} and denote it by $\mathscr{F}_k(x; \alpha, \beta)$. This function plays a central role in our study. The function $\mathscr{F}_k(x; \alpha, \beta)$ possesses elegant properties, for example, we prove that it satisfies the two, three and six-term functional equations. As a result of our Kronecker limit formula and functional equations, we provide another expression for the combinations of zeta values. Finally, we interpret our Kronecker ``limit" formula in terms of cohomological relations and establish a connection between $\mathscr{F}_k(x; \alpha, \beta)$ and a generalized Dedekind-eta function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Golomb--Keller formula expresses the next prime $p_{n+1}$ as a recurrence relation in terms of the first $n$ primes $p_1, \ldots, p_n$ using the Riemann zeta function and an Euler product, but requires taking a limit as $s \to \infty$, rendering it non-constructive. We transform this asymptotic formula into an effective recurrence by proving that a finite parameter $s \leq p_n$ suffices when combined with the ceiling function, establishing a constructive method valid for all $n \geq 1$. The minimal integer parameter $s_n$ (OEIS A389650) reveals deep connections to prime constellations. We prove $\liminf_{n\to\infty} \sigma_n = 0$ unconditionally, where $\sigma_n = s_n/p_n$. The limit superior $C = \limsup \sigma_n$ satisfies $\log \psi \lesssim C \leq 0.4332$, where $\psi \approx 1.46557$ is the supergolden ratio. The lower bound is conditional on the twin prime conjecture; the upper bound is unconditional. The constant $C$ relates to the densest admissible prime constellation, connecting to the Hardy--Littlewood conjectures. The method extends to Dirichlet L-functions, yielding other effective formulas for calculating $p_{n+1}$ but also for predicting residues of $p_{n+1}$ modulo any integer with reduced precision requirements.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Building on the Atiyah--Singer holomorphic Lefschetz fixed-point theorem, we define ramification modules associated to the fixed loci of a finite group acting on a compact complex manifold. This allows us to generalize the Chevalley--Weil formula for compact Riemann surfaces to higher dimensions. More precisely, let $G$ be a finite group acting on a compact complex manifold $X$, and let $\mathcal{E}$ be a $G$-equivariant locally free sheaf on $X$. Then, in the representation ring $R(G)_\mathbb{Q}$, we have $$ \chi_G(X, \mathcal{E}):=\sum_{i=0}^{\dim X}(-1)^i[H^i(X, \mathcal{E})]=\frac{1}{|G|}\chi(X,\mathcal{E})[\mathbb{C}[G]] + \sum_Z\Gamma(\mathcal{E})_Z $$ where $Z$ runs over all connected components of the fixed-point sets $X^g$ for $g\in G$, and each $\Gamma(\mathcal{E})_Z\in R(X)_\mathbb{Q}$, called the \emph{ramification module} at $Z$, depends only on the restriction $\mathcal{E}|_Z$ and the normal bundle $N_{Z/X}$ as $G_Z$-equivariant bundles. We illustrate the computation of $\Gamma(\mathcal{E})_Z$ in several special cases and provide a detailed example for faithful actions of $G\cong(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^n$ on a compact complex surface.</p></details>

When $G$ is the group of order preserving self-bijections of the real line there are four such measures, and the resulting tensor categories are called the Delannoy categories. The first Delannoy category is semi-simple, and was studied in detail by Harman, Snowden, and Snyder. We give universal properties for all four Delannoy categories in terms of ordered \'etale algebras. As a consequence, we show that the second and third Delannoy categories admit at least two local abelian envelopes, and the fourth admits at least four. We also prove a coarser universal property for $\underline{\mathrm{Perm}}(G, \mu)$ for a general oligomorphic group $G$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A generalization of an argument due to Etingof-Nikshych-Ostrik yields a highly efficient necessary criterion for integral modular categorification. This criterion allows us to complete the classification of categorifiable integral modular data up to rank 14, and up to rank 25 in the odd-dimensional case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G=\langle x^d+c_1,\dots,x^d+c_s\rangle$ be a semigroup generated under composition for some $c_1,\dots,c_s\in\mathbb{Z}$ and some $d\geq2$. Then we prove that, outside of an exceptional one-parameter family, $G$ contains a large and explicit subset of irreducible polynomials if and only if it contains at least one irreducible polynomial. In particular, this conclusion holds when $G$ is generated by at least $s\geq3$ polynomials when $d$ is odd and at least $s\geq5$ polynomials when $d$ is even. To do this, we prove a classification result for prime powered iterates under $f(x)=x^d+c$ when $c\in\mathbb{Z}$ is nonzero. Namely, if $f^n(\alpha)=y^p$ for some $n\geq4$, some $\alpha,y\in\mathbb{Z}$, and some prime $p|d$, then $\alpha$ and $y^p$ are necessarily preperiodic and periodic points for $f$ respectively. Moreover, we note that $n=4$ is the smallest possible iterate for which one may make this conclusion.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E$ be an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by a ring $R$, where $R$ is an order in an imaginary quadratic field or quaternion algebra. We define sesquilinear pairings ($R$-linear in one variable and $R$-conjugate linear in the other), taking values in an $R$-module, generalizing the Weil and Tate-Lichtenbaum pairings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give two distinct proofs of the Gross-Zagier formula in terms of sums of automorphic Green's functions realized as regularized theta lifts, including one involving arithmetic Hirzebruch-Zagier divisors on the Hilbert modular surface $X_0(N) \times X_0(N)$. We then describe applications to the refined conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer. Through these calculations, we also describe known and conjectural relations of the central derivative values of Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions that appear to Fourier coefficients of certain half-integral weight forms.</p></details>
