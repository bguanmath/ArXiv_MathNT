 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Bernd C. Kellner &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 17 pages, 4 tables

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Extending previous work of the author, we compute the Wilson quotient modulo $p^5$ and $p^6$, and equivalently $(p-1)!$ modulo $p^6$ and $p^7$, respectively. Further, we determine some power sums of the Fermat quotients up to modulo $p^6$. Subsequently, we discuss some patterns that occur in the $p$-adic coefficients of the Wilson quotient as well as of $(p-1)!$, whereby the original congruence $(p-1)! \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$ fits perfectly into the theory.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Bernd C. Kellner &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 16 pages, 1 table, 1 figure, revised

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By recent work of the author, Wilson's theorem as well as the Wilson quotient can be described by supercongruences of power sums of Fermat quotients modulo every higher prime power. We translate these congruences into congruences of power sums and Bernoulli numbers. This together provides relatively short proofs of the congruences compared to former approaches. As an application, we compute, e.g., the Wilson quotient up to modulo $p^4$ and equivalently the factorial $(p-1)!$ up to modulo $p^5$, which can be extended to any higher prime power with some effort. As a by-product, we determine some power sums of the Fermat quotients up to modulo $p^4$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kimball Martin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 31 pages, 12 figures; this version corrects minor mathematical misprints in the published version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, we showed that global root numbers of modular forms are biased toward +1. Together with Pharis, we also showed an initial bias of Fourier coefficients towards the sign of the root number. First, we prove analogous results with respect to local root numbers. Second, a subtle correlation between Fourier coefficients and global root numbers, termed murmurations, was recently discovered for elliptic curves and modular forms. We conjecture murmurations in a more general context of different (possibly empty) combinations of local root numbers. Last, an appendix corrects a sign error in our joint paper with Pharis.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 16 pages; this version corrects a mathematical misprint in the published version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Previously we observed that newforms obey a strict bias towards root number $+1$ in squarefree levels: at least half of the newforms in $S_k(\Gamma_0(N))$ with root number $+1$ for $N$ squarefree, and it is strictly more than half outside of a few special cases. Subsequently, other authors treated levels which are cubes of squarefree numbers. Here we treat arbitrary levels, and find that if the level is not the square of a squarefree number, this strict bias still holds for any weight. In fact the number of such exceptional levels is finite for fixed weight, and 0 if $k < 12$. We also investigate some variants of this question to better understand the exceptional levels.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A recent result of Rickards states that the generating series of intersection numbers of real quadratic geodesics on indefinite Shimura curves are elliptic modular forms. We reinterpret this as a Kudla-Millson theta series, and prove that Rickards' generating series is the diagonal restriction of a Hilbert modular form, analogous to results of Darmon-Pozzi-Vonk and Branchereau.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Several minor corrections and improved exposition, comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $X$ a smooth proper $K$-variety with good reduction. Under a mild assumption on the behaviour of Hodge numbers under reduction modulo $p$, we prove that the existence of a non-zero global 2-form on $X$ implies, after a finite extension of $K$, the existence of $p$-torsion Brauer classes with surjective evaluation map. This implies that any smooth proper variety over a number field which satisfies weak approximation over all finite extensions has no non-zero global 2-form. The proof is based on a prismatic interpretation of Brauer classes with eventually constant evaluation, and a Newton-above-Hodge result for the mod $p$ reduction of prismatic cohomology. This generalises work of Bright and the second-named author beyond the ordinary reduction case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an explicit asymptotic formula for the logarithm of the minimal ranks of $n$-universal lattices over the ring of integers of totally real number fields. We also show that, for any constant $C > 0$ and $n \geq 3$, there are only finitely many totally real fields with an $n$-universal lattice of rank at most $C$, with all such fields being effectively computable. Similarly, for any $n \geq 3$, we show that there are only finitely many totally real fields admitting an $n$-universal criterion set of size at most $C$, with all such fields likewise being effectively computable.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Pascal Koiran, Rafael Oliveira &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** cs.CC &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a generalization to Jennrich's uniqueness theorem for tensor decompositions in the undercomplete setting. Our uniqueness theorem is based on an alternative definition of the standard tensor decomposition, which we call matrix-vector decomposition. Moreover, in the same settings in which our uniqueness theorem applies, we also design and analyze an efficient randomized algorithm to compute the unique minimum matrix-vector decomposition (and thus a tensor rank decomposition of minimum rank). As an application of our uniqueness theorem and our efficient algorithm, we show how to compute all matrices of minimum rank (up to scalar multiples) in certain generic vector spaces of matrices.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: 40 pages, final version to appear on Adv. Theor. Math. Phys

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We combine the theory of Cartan-Tanaka prolongations with the Molien-Weyl integral formula and Hilbert-Poincar\'e series to compute the Spencer cohomology groups of the $D=11$ Poincar\'e superalgebra $\mathfrak p$, relevant for superspace formulations of $11$-dimensional supergravity in terms of nonholonomic superstructures. This includes novel fermionic Spencer groups, providing with new cohomology classes of $\mathbb Z$-grading $1$ and form number $2$. Using the Hilbert-Poincar\'e series and the Euler characteristic, we also explore Spencer cohomology contributions in higher form numbers. We then propose a new general definition of filtered deformations of graded Lie superalgebras along first-order fermionic directions and investigate such deformations of $\mathfrak p$ that are maximally supersymmetric. In particular, we establish a no-go type theorem for maximally supersymmetric filtered subdeformations of $\mathfrak p$ along timelike (i.e., generic) first-order fermionic directions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Thanasis Bouganis, Rafail Psyroukis &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 27 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a Dirichlet series $D_{F,G}(s)$ attached to two modular forms $F$ and $G$ of an orthogonal group of real signature $(2,4)$, involving their Fourier--Jacobi coefficients. When $F$ is a Hecke eigenform and $G$ a Poincar\'e series, our main result gives that $D_{F,G}(s)$ is equal to the standard $L$-function attached to $F$, up to an explicit constant. To establish this, we use a correspondence between binary Hermitian forms and ideals of quaternion algebras, as established by Latimer, together with the fact that the even Clifford algebra of a three-dimensional definite quadratic space can be identified with a quaternion division algebra. Our work should be seen as a generalisation of a work of Kohnen and Skoruppa, whose result corresponds to the case of the orthogonal group of real signature $(2,3)$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Daewoong Cheong, Gennian Ge, Doowon Koh, Thang Pham, Dung The Tran, Tao Zhang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 29 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a set $E \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$, the distance set is defined as $\Delta(E) := \{\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\| : \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in E\}$, where $\|\cdot\|$ denotes the standard quadratic form. We investigate the Erd\H{o}s--Falconer distance problem within the flexible class of $(u, s)$--Salem sets introduced by Fraser, with emphasis on the even case $u = 4$. By exploiting the exact identity between $\|\widehat{E}\|_4$ and the fourth additive energy $\Lambda_4(E)$, we prove that quantitative gains in $\Lambda_4(E)$ force the existence of many distances. In particular, for a $(4, s)$--Salem set $E\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ with $d \geq 2$, we prove that if $$ |E|\gg q^{\min\left\{\frac{d+2}{4s+1}, \frac{d+4}{8s}\right\}}, $$ then $E$ determines a positive proportion of all distances. This strictly improves Fraser's threshold of $\frac{d}{4s}$ and the Iosevich-Rudnev bound of $q^{\frac{d+1}{2}}$ in certain parameter ranges. As applications, we obtain improved thresholds for multiplicative subgroups and sets on arbitrary varieties, and establish a sharp incidence bound for Salem sets that is of independent interest in incidence geometry. We also propose a unified conjecture for $(4, s)$--Salem sets that reconciles known bounds and pinpoints the odd-dimensional sphere regime: in odd dimensions $d \geq 3$, the often-cited $\frac{d-1}{2}$ threshold does not follow without additional structure, while on primitive-radius spheres, any $q^{-\epsilon/2}$-gain in the fourth energy improves the standing threshold of $\frac{d}{2}$. This provides a new approach to address this problem.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Philip Schlösser &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Intermediate Macdonald polynomials for an affine root system $S$ with fixed origin and finite Weyl group $W_0$ are orthogonal polynomials invariant under a parabolic subgroup $W_J\le W_0$. The extreme cases of $W_J=1$ and $W_J=W_0$ correspond to the non-symmetric and symmetric Macdonald polynomials, respectively. In this paper we use double-affine Hecke algebras to study their basic properties, including that they form an orthogonal basis and that they diagonalise a commutative algebra of difference-reflection operators, and calculate their norms. Finally, we provide two interpretations of intermediate Macdonald polynomials as vector-valued polynomials of which examples can be found in the literature.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a real group $G$, it is known from the work of Kostant and Vogan that the L-packet associated with an L-parameter $\varphi$ of $G$ contains a \emph{generic} representation if and only if the ${}^{\vee}G$-orbit in the variety of geometric parameters corresponding to $\varphi$ is open. In these notes, we generalize this result slightly by proving that the same equivalence holds when the L-packet of $\varphi$ is replaced by the micro-packet attached to $\varphi$ by Adams-Barbasch-Vogan. As a corollary, we deduce the Enhanced Shahidi Conjecture for real groups: the Arthur packet attached to an A-parameter $\psi$ of $G$ contains a generic representation if and only if $\psi|_{\mathrm{SL}_2}$ is trivial.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 27 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we extend Howard's construction of compatible families of Heegner points to the setting of towers of Gross curves and Shimura curves over totally real fields. Following the strategy of Longo and Vigni, our approach simultaneously treats totally definite and indefinite quaternion algebras. We then extend their interpolation methods to define big Heegner points attached to families of Hilbert modular forms of parallel weight under the weak Heegner hypothesis. Applying this construction, we build in the definite setting a totally real analogue of Longo$-$Vigni's two-variable $p$-adic $L$-function, and in the indefinite setting, a system of big Heegner classes in the sense of Howard.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: Minor changes to the overall structure of the paper

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study two classes of $\ell$-modular standard modules of the general linear group. The first class is obtained by reducing existing standard modules over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$ to $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell$ with respect to their natural integral structure. The second class is obtained by studying the generic extension map of the cyclical quiver, which was motivated by the construction of certain monomial bases of quantum algebras. In the later case we also manage to prove a modular version of the Langlands classification, similar to the work of Langlands and Zelevinsky over $\mathbb{C}$. We moreover compute the $\ell$-modular Rankin-Selberg $L$-function of both classes and check that they agree with the $L$-functions of their $\mathrm{C}$-parameters constructed by Kurinczuk and Matringe.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Marc Chamberland, Karl Dilcher &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the alternating sum of the floor function of $\sqrt{jn}$, with $j$ ranging from 1 to $n$, has an easy evaluation for all odd integers $n\geq 1$. This is in contrast to known non-alternating sums of the same type which hold only for a class of primes. The proof is elementary and was suggested by an AI model. To put this result in perspective, we also prove an asymptotic expression for the analogous sum without the floor function.</p></details>

By this classification, we show that for such toric singularities, all toric NCCRs are connected by iterated Iyama-Wemyss mutations.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 48 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop techniques at the interface between differential algebra and model theory to study the following problems of exponential algebraicity: Does a given algebraic differential equation admits an exponentially algebraic solution, that is, a holomorphic solution which is definable in the structure of restricted elementary functions? Do solutions of a given list of algebraic differential equations share a nontrivial exponentially algebraic relation, that is, a nontrivial relation definable in the structure of restricted elementary functions? These problems can be traced back to the work of Abel and Liouville on the problem of integration in finite terms. This article concerns generalizations of their techniques adapted to the study of exponential transcendence and independence problems for more general systems of differential equations. As concrete applications, we obtain exponential transcendence and independence statements for several classical functions: the error function, the Bessel functions, indefinite integrals of algebraic expressions involving Lambert's W-function, the equation of the pendulum, as well as corresponding decidability results.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce formulas for the logarithms of Drinfeld modules using a framework recently developed by the second author. We write the logarithm function as the evaluation under a motivic map of a product of rigid analytic trivializations of $t$-motives. We then specialize our formulas to express special values of Goss $L$-functions as Drinfeld periods multiplied by rigid analytic trivializations evaluated under this motivic map. We view these formulas as characteristic-$p$ analogues of integral representations of Hasse-Weil type zeta functions. We also apply this machinery for Drinfeld modules tensored with the tensor powers of the Carlitz module, which serves as the Tate twist of a Drinfeld module.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A $d$-silting object is a silting object whose derived endomorphism algebra has global dimension $d$ or less. We give an equivalent condition, which can be stated in terms of dg quivers, for silting mutations to preserve the $d$-siltingness under a mild assumption. Moreover, we show that this mild assumption is always satisfied by $\nu_d$-finite algebras. As an application, we give a counterexample to the open question by Herschend-Iyama-Oppermann: the quivers of higher hereditary algebras are acyclic. Our example is a $2$-representation tame algebra with a $2$-cycle which is derived equivalent to a toric Fano stacky surface.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The importance of studying $d$-tilting bundles, which are tilting bundles whose endomorphism algebras have global dimension $d$ (or less), on $d$-dimensional smooth projective varieties has been recognized recently. In Chan's paper, it is conjectured that a smooth projective surface has a $2$-tilting bundle if and only if it is weak del Pezzo. In this paper, we prove this conjecture. Moreover, we show that this endomorphism algebra becomes a $2$-representation infinite algebra whose 3-Calabi-Yau completion gives a non-commutative crepant resolution (NCCR) of the corresponding Du Val del Pezzo cone.</p></details>
