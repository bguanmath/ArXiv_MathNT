 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Il-Seung Jang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** v2: 29 pages, revised proof of Theorem 6.7, minor corrections; v1: 28 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the prefundamental modules $L_{s,a}^{\pm}$ over the Borel subalgebras of the twisted quantum loop algebras, which are introduced by Wang. A character formula for $L_{s,a}^{\pm}$ is obtained from that for the prefundamental modules over the untwisted quantum loop algebras by applying a character folding map. This allows us to realize minuscule prefundamental modules $L_{s,a}^{\pm}$ for types $A_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ and $D_{n+1}^{(2)}$ in terms of the unipotent quantum coordinate ring associated with the $s$-th level $0$ fundamental weight, where $s = 1$ for type $A_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ and $s = n$ for type $D_{n+1}^{(2)}$. This result is a continuation of the realization of (co)minuscule prefundamental modules established by earlier works [J-Kwon-Park, Int. Math. Res. Not., 2023] and [J-Kwon-Park, J. Algebra, 2025].</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kasun Fernando, Tanja I. Schindler &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DS &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Version as in the journal with an extension of Remark 2.16

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), the first order Edgeworth Expansion and a Mixing Local Central Limit Theorem (MLCLT) for Birkhoff sums of a class of unbounded heavily oscillating observables over a family of full-branch piecewise $C^2$ expanding maps of the interval. As a corollary, we obtain the corresponding results for Boolean-type transformations on $\mathbb{R}$. The class of observables in the CLT and the MLCLT on $\mathbb{R}$ include the real part, the imaginary part and the absolute value of the Riemann zeta function. Thus obtained CLT and MLCLT for the Riemann zeta function are in the spirit of the results of Lifschitz & Weber (2009) and Steuding (2012) who have proven the Strong Law of Large Numbers for "Sampling the Lindelöf hypothesis".</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** GyeongHyeon Nam, Anna Puskás &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 26 pages. Comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the proportion of zero entries in the character table of a sequence of reductive groups over a finite field. We prove an asymptotic lower bound when the reductive group is fixed and the size of the finite field increases. Furthermore, we prove that when considering a sequence of reductive groups with increasing semisimple rank, the proportion is asymptotically one. We also establish an additive analogue of this phenomenon in the context of a fixed reductive Lie algebra.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Buyan Li, Jie Xiao &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 40 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is a continuation of [5]. Using the root categories, we define the compact real forms of the complex semisimple Lie algebras, and maximal compact subgroups of the Chevalley groups over $\mathbb{C}$. In [7], Lusztig used the modified quantum group $\dot{\mathbf{U}}$ and its canonical basis to obtain the reductive group and its coordinate ring $\mathbf{O}_A$, in particular the tensor product decomposition of $\mathbf{O}_A$. By combining these two kinds of structures, we explore in this paper how the classical theory of the compact Lie groups, such as Peter-Weyl theorem and Plancherel theorem, can be recovered completely.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05690v1'>2512.05690</a>\]&nbsp; **Non-Archimedean Koksma Theorems and Dimensions of Exceptional Sets**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Aihua Fan, Shilei Fan, Hanfei Ye &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a non-Archimedean analogue of Koksma's theorem. For a local field F of characteristic zero, we prove that the sequence ([αx^n]) is uniformly distributed in the valuation ring O for almost every x with |x|_p>1. In the case of positive characteristic, ([x^n]) fails to be uniformly distributed, but it becomes μ*-uniformly distributed for some weighted measure μ*. These results are derived from a general metric theorem for sequences generated by expanding scaling maps. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the exceptional set of parameters x for which these sequences are not uniformly distributed is large (i.e. having full Hausdorff dimension) and share a rich q-homogeneous fractal structure.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 28 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the decomposition of a generic element $g \in G$ of a connected reductive complex algebraic group $G$ in the form $g = N(g) B(g) \bar{u} N(g)^{-1}$ where $N: G \dashrightarrow \mathcal{N}_-$ and $B : G \dashrightarrow \mathcal{B}_+$ are rational maps onto a unipotent subgroup $\mathcal{N}_-$ and a Borel subgroup $\mathcal{B}_+$ opposite to $\mathcal{N}_-$, and $\bar{u}$ is a representative of a Weyl group element $u$. We introduce a class of rational Weyl group elements that give rise to such decompositions, and study their various properties.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gerhard Hiss, Caroline Lassueur &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 35 pages, part II of a series of 4 articles, very minor correction to v2

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This series of papers is a contribution to the program of classifying $p$-blocks of finite groups up to source algebra equivalence, starting with the case of cyclic blocks. To any $p$-block $\mathbf{B}$ of a finite group with cyclic defect group $D$, Linckelmann associated an invariant $W( \mathbf{B} )$, which is an indecomposable endo-permutation module over $D$, and which, together with the Brauer tree of $\mathbf{B}$, essentially determines its source algebra equivalence class. In Parts II-IV of our series of papers, we classify, for odd $p$, those endo-permutation modules of cyclic $p$-groups arising from $p$-blocks of quasisimple groups. In the present Part II, we reduce the desired classification for the quasisimple classical groups of Lie type $B$, $C$, and $D$ to the corresponding objective for the general linear and unitary groups; the classification is completed for the latter groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For integer $n\geqslant 1$ and real $u$, let $Δ(n,u):=|\{d:d\mid n,\,{\rm e}^u<d\leqslant {\rm e}^{u+1}\}|$. The Erdős--Hooley Delta-function is then defined by $Δ(n):=\max_{u\in{\mathbb R}}Δ(n,u).$ We provide new upper bounds for weighted real moments of this function.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Robert Cass, Thibaud van den Hove, Jakob Scholbach &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Final version, to appear in Compositio Mathematica

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the geometric Satake equivalence for mixed Tate motives over the integral motivic cohomology spectrum. This refines previous versions of the geometric Satake equivalence for split reductive groups. Our new geometric results include Whitney--Tate stratifications of Beilinson--Drinfeld Grassmannians and cellular decompositions of semi-infinite orbits. With future global applications in mind, we also achieve an equivalence relative to a power of the affine line. Finally, we use our equivalence to give Tannakian constructions of Deligne's modification of the dual group and a modified form of Vinberg's monoid over the integers.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00892v3'>2406.00892</a>\]&nbsp; **Inductive systems of the symmetric group, polynomial functors and tensor categories**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kevin Coulembier &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We initiate the systematic study of modular representations of symmetric groups that arise via the braiding in (symmetric) tensor categories over fields of positive characteristic. We determine what representations appear for certain examples of tensor categories, develop general principles and demonstrate how this question connects with the ongoing study of the structure theory of tensor categories. We also formalise a theory of polynomial functors as functors which act coherently on all tensor categories. We conclude that the classification of such functors is a different way of posing the above question of which representation of symmetric groups appear. Finally, we extend the classical notion of strict polynomial functors from the category of (super) vector spaces to arbitrary tensor categories, and show that this idea is also a different packaging of the same information.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 31 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Closed geodesics associated with indefinite binary quadratic forms, or equivalently with real quadratic irrationals, have long been studied as geometric $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$-invariants. Building on the Birman-Williams approach to Lorenz knots and following the notion of modular knots introduced by Ghys, this article investigates the topological $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$-invariants arising from modular knots. Our main focus is the Alexander polynomial of modular knots. Using the Burau representation, we highlight two contrasting features of this family. On the one hand, for each fixed degree, only finitely many Alexander polynomials of modular knots occur. On the other hand, any integer appears as a coefficient of the Alexander polynomial of some modular knot, and coefficients of the same sign can occur in runs of arbitrarily long length.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 26 pages, many figures, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study several affine (=annular in this paper) versions of the classical diagram algebras such as Temperley-Lieb, partition, Brauer, Motzkin, rook Brauer, rook, planar partition, and planar rook algebras. We give generators and relation presentation for them and their associated categories, study their representation theory, and the asymptotic behavior of tensor products of their representations in the monoid case.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05431v1'>2512.05431</a>\]&nbsp; **Applying hypersurface bounds to a conjecture by Carlet**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zoë Gemmell, Tim Trudgian &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 11 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A function from $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ to $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ is $k$th order sum-free if the sum of its values over each $k$-dimensional $\mathbb{F}_2$-affine subspace is nonzero. It is conjectured that for $n$ odd and prime, $f_\textrm{inv}=x^{-1}$ is not $k$th order sum-free for $3 \leq k \leq n-3$. This is the unresolved part of Carlet's conjecture, which gives exact values for which $f_\textrm{inv}$ is $k$th order sum-free. We give two results as improvements on an explicit estimate on the number of $q$-rational points of an $\mathbb{F}_q$-definable hypersurface previously proved by Cafure and Matera. We use these results to prove that $f_\textrm{inv}$ is not $k$th order sum-free for $3\leq k \leq \frac{3}{13}n+0.461$, improving on work previously done by Hou and Zhao.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any large prime $q$, $1 \leq x \leq q$ and any real $0 \leq k \leq 1$, we prove an upper bound for the following $2k$-th moment $$\displaystyle \sum_{\substack{χ\bmod q}} \Big| \sum_{n\leq x} χ(n)λ(n)\Big|^{2k},$$ where $λ(n)$ denotes the Fourier coefficients of a fixed modular form. In particular, our result implies that $$\displaystyle \frac 1{q-1}\sum_{\substack{χ\bmod q}} \Big| \sum_{n\leq x} χ(n)λ(n)\Big|= o(\sqrt{x}),$$ when both $x$ and $q/x$ tend to infinity with $q$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 9 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct examples of threefolds with terminal singularities (resp. surfaces with canonical singularities) which are special in the sense of Campana, have a potentially dense set of integral points, admit a dense entire curve, have vanishing Kobayashi pseudometric, and are geometrically special in the sense of Javanpeykar-Rousseau but whose regular locus fails to have any of these properties. This improves on earlier work by Cadorel-Campana-Rousseau and joint work by the author with Javanpeykar-Levin, where such fourfolds with canonical singularities were constructed, and gives refined answers to questions due to Hassett-Tschinkel and Kamenova-Lehn. Lastly, we show that some of our examples satisfy the weak approximation property and briefly discuss a question on puncturing varieties satisfying strong approximation raised by Wittenberg.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Khemais Maktouf, Pierre Torasso &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we examine the restriction of the metaplectic representation $π$ over a $p$-adic field $k$, $p\neq2$, of zero characteristic to an isotropic torus $S$ contained in the symplectic group. First we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the momentum map in order that $S$ be admissible, that is $π_{\vert S}$ decomposes with finite multiplicities. Let us say that a torus contained in the symplectic group is irreducible if its action on the symplectic space is irreducible over $k$. Then we examine the case when $S$ is a proper subtorus of a maximal irreducible torus $T$ in the symplectic group and give sufficient conditions on $T$ in order that $S$ never be admissible. When these conditions are not satisfied, we give examples of admissible proper tori of a maximal irreducible torus. Finally, for any admissible subtorus $S$ of a certain type of maximal irreducible torus, we compute the multiplicity of the unitary characters of $S$ appearing into $π_{\vert S}$. We also show that the multiplicity of such a character is equal to the volume of the symplectic reduction of the inverse image under the momentum map of a linear form associated to it.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 92 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The rational points of a smooth curve $X$ over a number field $k$ map to the set of augmentations of the associated motivic algebra. An expectation, related to Kim's conjecture, is that for $X$ hyperbolic, the set of augmentations which come locally at each place of $k$ from a point is equal to the set of rational points. Our view is that this should provide a relative of the Grothendieck section conjecture which may be both more accessible, and more directly applicable, than the latter. As a first step in this direction, we extend aspects of the ``Weil height machine'' to the set of such augmentations, and use this to prove a Manin--Dem'janenko-style finiteness result for motivic augmentations for particular curves. Along the way, we determine the structure of the cohomological motive of a $\mathbb{G}_m$-bundle over an algebraic variety as a highly structured algebra in the derived $\infty$-category of mixed motives with rational coefficients.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article gives a generalization of the work of Y.Ding in the context of $\mathrm{GSp}_4(\mathbb{Q}_p)$, where $p$ is an odd prime number. Let $ρ$ be a 4-dimensional generic non-critical crystalline representations of the absolute Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ of regular Hodge-Tate weights which is valued in $\mathrm{GSp}_4(E)$, where $E$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$, we associate to $ρ$ an explicit locally analytic $E$-representation $π_\mathrm{min}(ρ)$ of $\mathrm{GSp}_4(\mathbb{Q}_p)$, which encodes enough information to determines $ρ$. Moreover, under certain settings, this construction follows the local-global compatibility.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Consider a bounded prism $(A,I)$ and a bounded quasi-l.c.i algebra $R$ over $\overline{A}$. In this paper, for any prism $S/A$ with a surjection $S\to R$ such that $\widehat{\mathbb L}_{\overline{S}/\overline{A}}$ is a $p$-completely flat module over $\overline{S}$, we establish an equivalence of categories between rational Hodge-Tate crystals on $(R/A)_Δ$ and topologically nilpotent integrable connections on the Hodge--Tate cohomology ring $\overlineΔ_{R/S}$. As an application, for a non-zero divisor $a\in \overline{A}$, we introduce the concept of $a$-smallness for a rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystal on $(R/A)_Δ$. Finally, we focus on some special algebras $R$ over $\mathcal O_{\mathbb C_p}$ (or generally, the ring of integers of an algebraic closed and complete non-archimedean field) including all $p$-completely smooth algebras, $p$-complete algebras with semi-stable reductions and geometric valuation rings. By using our equivalence, we analyze the restriction functor from the category of $a$-small rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystals to the category of $v$-vector bundles. This yields some new results in $p$-adic non-abelian Hodge Theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages, 10 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a bijective correspondence between the number of nilpotent matrices over a Boolean semiring and the number of directed acyclic graphs on ordered vertices. We then enumerate pairs of maps between two finite sets whose composites are eventually constant by forming a bijection that relates a pair of such maps with a spanning tree in a complete bipartite graph, and an edge of said tree. This generalizes the main principle of A. Joyal's proof of Cayley's formula. Finally, we generalize T. Leinster's work by considering a pair of finite-dimensional vector spaces and show a bijectivity between a nilpotent pair of maps and a balanced vector with the hom spaces between them. This leads us to an elegant formula for the number of nilpotent pairs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define the notion of a Brauer pair of a chain complex, extending the notion of a Brauer pair of a $p$-permutation module introduced by Boltje and Perepelitsky. In fact, the Brauer pairs of a splendid Rickard equivalence $C$ coincide with the set of Brauer pairs of the corresponding $p$-permutation equivalence $Λ(C)$ induced by $C$. As a result, we derive structural results for splendid Rickard equivalences that correspond to known structural properties for $p$-permutation equivalences. In particular, we show splendid Rickard equivalences induce local splendid Rickard equivalences between normalizer block algebras as well as centralizer block algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that, given the Balmer spectrum of any essentially small monoidal-triangulated category, one has a classification of semiprime thick tensor-ideals arising in terms of a "pseudo-Hochster-dual" of the noncommutative Balmer spectrum. This extends Balmer's classification of radical thick tensor-ideals to noncommutative tensor-triangular geometry. To achieve this, we utilize the notion of support data for lattices and frames, under which the classification follows via Stone duality. We also give a characterization for when the noncommutative Balmer spectrum behaves as it does in tensor-triangular geometry, that is, when it is a spectral space with quasi-compact opens given by complements of supports. Finally, we show that rigid centrally generated monoidal-triangulated categories satisfy this property, and we answer a question posed by Negron--Pevtsova regarding classification of one-sided tensor-ideals via cohomological support.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop (quantum) cluster algebra structures over arbitrary commutative unital rings $\Bbbk$ and prove that the (quantized) coordinate rings of connected simply-connected complex simple algebraic groups $G$ over $\Bbbk$ admit such structures. We first show that the integral form of the quantized coordinate ring of $G$ admits an upper quantum cluster algebra structure over $\mathbb{A}=\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm\frac{1}{2}}]$ by using a combination of tools from quantum groups, canonical bases and cluster algebras and a previous result of the second and third authors over $\mathbb{Q}(q^{\frac{1}{2}})$. We then obtain (integral) quantum versions of recent results of the first author: when $G$ is not of type $F_4$, the quantized coordinate ring of $G$ admits a quantum cluster algebra structure over $\mathbb{A}'$, where $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{A}$ when $G$ is not of types $G_2$, $E_8$, and $F_4$; $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{A}[(q^2+1)^{-1}]$ when $G$ is of type $G_2$, and $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{Q}(q^{\frac{1}{2}})$ when $G$ is of type $E_8$. We furthermore prove that the classical versions of these results hold over $\mathbb{A}'$ (where $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{Z}$ if $G$ is not of type $F_4$ or $G_2$ and $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{2}]$ if $G$ is of type $G_2$) and that the integral form of the coordinate ring of $G$ of type $F_4$ is an upper cluster algebra. Finally, by using common triangular bases of (quantum) cluster algebras, we prove that the above results also hold under specializations of $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{A}'$ to commutative unital rings $\Bbbk$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a perverse sheaf on the moduli stack of principally polarized abelian varieties or the moduli stack of smooth curves with n marked points over a field of characteristic zero, we prove that the (orbifold) Euler characteristic is nonnegative. For constant coefficients, this follows immediately from formulas of Harer-Zagier and Harder. Our proof is different and in the case of abelian varieties uses log Dubson-Kashiwara plus the fact that Hodge bundles are nef. For curves, we require an additional inequality established using Beilinson's gluing construction. The first main result is shown to be false in positive characteristic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the present paper, we study the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of 2-adic local fields from the point of view of anabelian geometry. Let us recall that it is well-known that the natural homomorphism from the automorphism group of a mixed-characteristic local field to the outer automorphism group of the absolute Galois group of the given mixed-characteristic local field is injective. Moreover, Hoshi and the author of the present paper proved that, for absolutely abelian mixed-characteristic local fields with odd residue characteristic $p$ and even extension degree over ${\mathbb Q}_p$, this subgroup arising from field automorphisms is not normal in the outer automorphism group and has infinitely many distinct conjugates. As a result in this direction, one of the main results of the present paper is the assertion that if a 2-adic local field satisfies certain conditions, then the set of conjugates of the subgroup arising from field automorhisms in the outer automorphism group is infinite, which thus implies that this subgroup is not normal in the outer automorphism group. On the other hand, for an odd prime number $p$, Hoshi proved the existence of an irreducible Hodge-Tate $p$-adic representation of dimension two of the absolute Galois group of a $p$-adic local field and an automorphism of the absolute Galois group such that the $p$-adic Galois representation obtained by pulling back the given $p$-adic Galois representation by the given automorphism is not Hodge-Tate. As a result in a direction that is different from the above direction, another main result of the present paper is the existence of a pair of a representation and an automorphism that is similar to the above pair in the case where $p=2$.</p></details>

Without assuming the four exponentials conjecture, we show that if $α$ and $β$ are multiplicatively independent Gaussian integers, and at least one of $α$, $β$ is not an $n$-th root of an integer, then any $α$- and $β$-automatic configuration is eventually periodic; in particular we prove Hansel and Safer's conjecture. Otherwise, there exist non-eventually periodic configurations which are $α$-automatic for any root of an integer $α$. Our work generalises the Cobham-Semenov theorem to Gaussian numerations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper discusses what the dimension data of irreducible representations of a finite group looks like in some specific cases, including unipotent and reductive groups over finite fields. The essence of our investigation is whether the dimension data of irreducible representations of a finite group can be ``geometerized'', to become equal to the cardinality of certain orbit spaces. The first part of this paper deals with nilpotent and reductive groups over finite fields, whereas the second part deals with the symmetric group $S_n$. The main conclusion that we want to bring out to contrast these two cases is that for reductive groups over finite fields, the dimension data is concentrated (in a statistical sense) in a neighborhood of the maximal dimension, whereas for the symmetric group, it is spread out.</p></details>

> **Comment:** minor corrections and simplifications to some proofs

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $ψ$ be an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass form with a large spectral parameter $λ>0$ on a compact arithmetic congruence hyperbolic 3-manifold $X=Γ\backslash\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})/\mathrm{SU}(2)$, and let $Y$ be a totally geodesic surface in $X$ with bounded diameter. The local $L^2$-bound for the restriction of $ψ$ to $Y$ is $\|ψ|_Y\|_{L^2(Y)}\ll λ^{1/4}$ by Burq, Gérard, and Tzvetkov. We apply the method of arithmetic amplification developed by Iwaniec and Sarnak to obtain a power saving over the local bound. The new feature in the proof is that we establish two different estimates for the integrals of $ψ|_Y$ against geodesic beams over $Y$ via two amplification arguments. Combining these estimates, we can improve the local bound for generalized Fourier coefficients of $ψ|_Y$ against eigenfunctions on $Y$ with spectral parameters near $λ$. We also apply the amplification method to obtain a power saving over the trivial bound $O(1)$ for $L^2$-norms of $ψ$ restricted to $λ^{-1/2}$-neighborhoods of unit-length geodesic segments. Consequently, by applying a result of Blair and Sogge, we obtain power savings over the local $L^p$-bounds of $ψ$ by Sogge for $2<p<4$ from our improved bound for the Kakeya-Nikodym norm.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Classical studies of the Fibonacci sequence focus on its periodicity modulo $m$ (the Pisano periods) with canonical initialization. We investigate instead the complete periodic structure arising from all $m^2$ possible initializations in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. We discover perfect chiral symmetry between the Fibonacci recurrence $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and its parity transform $a_n = - a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and observe fractal self-similarity in the extension from prime to prime power moduli. Additionally, we classify prime moduli based on their quadratic reciprocity and demonstrate that periodic sequences exhibit weight preservation under modular extension. Furthermore, we define a minima distribution $P(n)$ governed by Lucas ratios, which satisfies the symmetric relation $P(n)=P(1-n)$. For cyclotomic recurrences, we propose explicit counting functions for the number of distinct periods with connections to necklace enumeration. These findings imply potential connections to Viswanath's random recurrence, modular forms and L-functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We completely classify Laurent series converging on the unit circle over a non-Archimedean local field (of any characteristic) that map infinitely many roots of unity to roots of unity. For a given Laurent series $f$ over a field of positive characteristic with residue field $\mathbb{F}_q$, we prove effective bounds for the number of possible roots of unity in terms of the number of zeroes of the auxilliary function $f(x^q)-f(x)^q$ on the unit circle. In characteristic $0$ our bound is still effective but also depends on the ramification degree of the base field over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ as well as the size of the coefficients of $f$. This has applications to the Manin-Mumford conjecture in $\mathbb{G}_m^2$. In characteristic $0$, this work builds upon a pigeon-hole based method by Schmidt.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A well-known consequence of Schur's theorem is that for $r\in \mathbb{N}$, if $n$ is sufficiently large, then any $r$-colouring of $[n]$ results in monochromatic $a,b,c\in [n]$ such that $ab=c$. In this paper we are interested in the threshold at which the binomial random set $[n]_p$ almost surely inherits this Ramsey-type property. In particular for $r=2$ colours, we show that this threshold lies between $n^{-1/9-o(1)}$ and $n^{-1/11}$. Whilst analogous questions for solutions to (sets of) linear equations are now well understood, our work suggests that both the behaviour of the thresholds and the proof methods needed to determine them differ substantially in the non-linear setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we describe an approach to construct large extendable collections of vectors in predefined spaces of given dimensions. These collections are useful for neural network latent space configuration and training. For classification problem with large or unknown number of classes this allows to construct classifiers without classification layer and extend the number of classes without retraining of network from the very beginning. The construction allows to create large well-spaced vector collections in spaces of minimal possible dimension. If the number of classes is known or approximately predictable, one can choose sufficient enough vector collection size. If one needs to significantly extend the number of classes, one can extend the collection in the same latent space, or to incorporate the collection into collection of higher dimensions with same spacing between vectors. Also, regular symmetric structure of constructed vector collections can significantly simplify problems of search for nearest cluster centers or embeddings in the latent space. Construction of vector collections is based on combinatorics and geometry of semi-simple Lie groups irreducible representations with highest weight.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Supersingular elliptic curve isogeny graphs underlie isogeny-based cryptography. For isogenies of a single prime degree $\ell$, their structure has been investigated graph-theoretically. We generalise the notion of $\ell$-isogeny graphs to $L$-isogeny graphs (studied in the prime field case by Delfs and Galbraith), where $L$ is a set of small primes dictating the allowed isogeny degrees in the graph. We analyse the graph-theoretic structure of $L$-isogeny graphs. Our approaches may be put into two categories: cycles and graph cuts. On the topic of cycles, we provide: a count for the number of cycles in the $L$-isogeny graph with cyclic kernels using traces of Brandt matrices; an efficiently computable estimate based on this approach; and a third ideal-theoretic count for a certain subclass of $L$-isogeny cycles. We provide code to compute each of these three counts. On the topic of graph cuts, we compare several algorithms to compute graph cuts which minimise a measure called the edge expansion, outlining a cryptographic motivation for doing so. Our results show that a greedy neighbour algorithm out-performs standard spectral algorithms for computing optimal graph cuts. We provide code and study explicit examples. Furthermore, we describe several directions of active and future research.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study locally analytic vectors in the "partially" completed cohomology of Shimura varieties associated with some rank $2$ unitary groups over a totally real field $F^+$ such that $F^+_v = \mathbb{Q}_{p^2}$ for some $p$-adic places $v$ and prove a certain classicality theorem. This is a partial generalization and modification of Lue Pan's work in the modular curve case by using the works of Caraiani-Scholze, Koshikawa and Zou on mod $l$ cohomology of Shimura varieties. As applications, we prove the automorphy lifting theorem and the Breuil-M$\mathrm{\acute{e}}$zard conjecture in some $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_{p^2})$ cases. We will assume a technical regularity condition on Serre weights of residual representations, but we don't assume any technical condition on the properties of liftings of residual representations at $p$-adic places except Hodge-Tate regularity. It should be noted that previously, such results were known only when we assumed that $F^+_v$ is equal to $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for any $p$-adic place $v$ of $F^+$ so that we can use the $p$-adic Langlands correspondence of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. Moreover, we propose a conjectural strategy to prove such results in some $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_{p^f})$ cases.</p></details>

We present a concise reconstruction of the theory based on a systematic use of linear operators, with particular attention to umbral operators. We also give an in-depth study of the generating functions associated to umbral calculus, and show how these lead to short proofs of several advanced results, including the Lagrange-Bürmann inversion theorem. Finally, we discuss pseudoinverses for delta operators and illustrate our methods with a variety of examples.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We sharpen and generalize the dimension growth bounds for the number of points of bounded height lying on an irreducible algebraic variety of degree $d$, over any global field. In particular, we focus on the affine hypersurface situation by relaxing the condition on the top degree homogeneous part of the polynomial describing the affine hypersurface, while sharpening the dependence on the degree in the bounds compared to previous results. We formulate a conjecture about plane curves which provides a conjectural approach to the uniform degree $3$ case (the only remaining open case). For induction on dimension, we develop a higher dimensional effective version of Hilbert's irreducibility theorem, which is of independent interest.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we generalize the special subset of the Markov-Lagrange spectrum (and the Markov spectrum) called the discrete Markov spectrum. The discrete Markov spectrum is defined in terms of the Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz.$ Using the tool called snake graphs, originating from cluster algebra theory, we first reconstruct proofs of its properties in a combinatorial framework and then extend it to the generalized setting. We then introduce the generalized discrete Markov spectrum, defined analogously via the generalized Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k_1 yz + k_2 zx + k_3 xy = (3 + k_1 + k_2 + k_3) xyz.$ We prove that this generalized spectrum is contained in the Markov-Lagrange spectrum and thus the Markov spectrum.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By work of a number of authors, beginning with Scott and culminating with Galashin and Lam, the coordinate rings of positroid varieties in the Grassmannian carry cluster algebra structures. In fact, they typically carry many such structures, the two best understood being the source-labelled and target-labelled structures, referring to how the initial cluster is computed from a Postnikov diagram or plabic graph. In this article, we show that these two cluster algebra structures quasi-coincide, meaning in particular that a cluster variable in one structure may be expressed in the other structure as the product of a cluster variable and a Laurent monomial in the frozen variables. This resolves a conjecture attributed to Muller and Speyer from 2017. The proof depends critically on categorification: of the relevant cluster algebra structures by the author, of perfect matchings and twists by the author with Çanakçı and King, and of quasi-equivalences of cluster algebras by Fraser and Keller. By similar techniques, we also show that Muller and Speyer's left twist map is a quasi-cluster equivalence from the target-labelled structure to the source-labelled structure.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study small-doubling subsets of finite-dimensional vector spaces over finite fields of odd characteristic. Let $A \subset \mathbb{F}_p^n$ be non-empty with $|A+A| \le K|A|$. We prove that $A$ can be covered by at most $K^{O(1)}$ cosets of a subspace $H \le \mathbb{F}_p^n$ with $|H| \le K^{O(1)}|A|$, giving a polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa (PFR/Marton) theorem in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ for odd primes $p$. The key input is a polynomial stability lemma which yields a dichotomy: either the $L^4$ Fourier mass of $1_A$ concentrates on a span of dimension $\mathrm{poly}(K)$, or in a quotient of codimension $\mathrm{poly}(K)$ the doubling constant decreases by at least $K^{-C}$. Iterating the latter alternative and combining it with standard covering arguments gives the polynomial-structured conclusion. In conjunction with the characteristic-$2$ results of Green, Gowers, Manners, and Tao, our methods provide an alternative finite-field route to Marton-type Freiman--Ruzsa theorems across all characteristics.</p></details>

Briefly stated, an $\mathcal{S}$-perfect number is an integer equal to a weighted sum of its proper divisors, where the weights are drawn from some fixed set $\mathcal{S}$ of integers. After a short exposition of the definitions and some basic results, we present our preliminary investigations into the $\mathcal{S}$-perfect numbers for various special sets $\mathcal{S}$ of small cardinality. In particular, we show that there are infinitely many $\{0, m\}$-perfect numbers and $\{-1,m\}$-perfect numbers for every $m \geq 1$. We also provide a characterization of the $\{-1,m\}$-perfect numbers of the form $2^kp$ ($k \geq 1$, $p$ an odd prime), as well as a characterization of all even $\{-1, 1\}$-perfect numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by the convolutive behavior of the counting function for partitions with designated summands in which all parts are odd, we consider coefficient sequences $(a_n)_{n\ge 0}$ of primitive eta-products that satisfy the generic convolutive property \begin{align*} \sum_{n\ge 0} a_{mn} q^n = \left(\sum_{n\ge 0} a_n q^n\right)^m \end{align*} for a specific positive integer $m$. Given the results of an exhaustive search of the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences for such sequences for $m$ up to $6$, we first focus on the case where $m=2$ with our attention mainly paid to the combinatorics of two $2$-convolutive sequences, featuring bijective proofs for both. For other $2$-convolutive sequences discovered in the OEIS, we apply generating function manipulations to show their convolutivity. We also give two examples of $3$-convolutive sequences. Finally, we discuss other convolutive series that are not eta-products.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a natural enlargement of the BGG Category O for a semisimple Lie algebra: the category of weight modules with trivial central character and finite-dimensional weight spaces supported on the root lattice. We give a geometric realization of this category as unipotently monodromic sheaves on the flag variety satisfying a singular support condition. We then explain that a derived version $\mathcal{D}$ of this category is Koszul dual to the Kazhdan-Laumon Category O, a different enlargement of the BGG Category O obtained from a gluing construction for sheaves on the flag variety. This characterizes $\mathcal{D}$ as the category of algebras over a natural monad on a direct sum of copies of the derived Category O. These results give new interpretations of classical algebraic constructions of weight modules over semisimple Lie algebras due to Fernando and Mathieu. We also conjecture that our results fit naturally into a proposed Koszul duality relating the small quantum group and the semi-infinite flag variety to the geometry of affine Springer fibers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Drinfeld's degenerate affine analog of Schur-Weyl duality relates representations of the degenerate affine Hecke algebra $AH_r$ to representations of the Yangian $Y_n$. One way to understand the construction is to introduce an intermediate algebra $AS(n,r)$, the degenerate affine Schur algebra, which appears both as the endomorphism algebra of an induced tensor space over $AH_r$, and as the image of a homomorphism $D_{n,r}:Y_n \rightarrow AS(n,r)$. In this paper, we describe $D_{n,r}$ using a diagrammatic calculus. Then we use a theorem of Drinfeld to compute $\ker D_{n,r}$ when $n > r$, thereby giving a presentation of $AS(n,r)$ in these cases. We formulate a conjecture in the remaining cases. Finally, we apply results of Arakawa to develop some of the representation theory of $AS(n,r)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the additive theory of the set $S = \{1^c, 2^c, \dots, N^c\}$ when $c$ is a real number. In the language of additive combinatorics, we determine the asymptotic behaviour of the additive energy of $S$. When $c$ is rational, this is either known, or follows from existing results, and our contribution is a resolution of the irrational case. We deduce that for all $c \not \in \{0, 1, 2\}$, the cardinality of the sumset $S + S$ asymptotically attains its natural upper bound $N(N + 1)/2$, as $N \to \infty$. We show that there are infinitely many, effectively computable numbers $c$ such that the set $\{p^c : \textrm{$p$ prime}\}$ is additively dissociated (actually linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$), and we provide an effective procedure to compute the digits of such $c$.</p></details>

When $k =0$, this recovers the ordinary Markov numbers. A long-standing question in the theory of Markov numbers is Frobenius's unicity conjecture, concerning whether every Markov number is the maximum in a unique solution triple. Aigner gave a series of weaker, related conjectures which were confirmed to be true by Lee, Li, Rabideau, and Schiffler using techniques from the theory of cluster algebras. We show here that $k$-Markov numbers also satisfy Aigner's conjectures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct left and right Calabi-Yau structures on derived respectively singularity categories of symmetric orders $Λ$ over commutative Gorenstein rings $R$. For this, we first construct Calabi-Yau structures over $R$ by lifting Amiot's construction of Calabi-Yau structures on Verdier quotients to the dg level. Then we prove base change properties relating Calabi-Yau structures over $R$ to those over the base field $k$. As a result, we prove the existence of a right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category associated with $Λ$ which is a cyclic lift of the weak Calabi-Yau structure constructed by the first-named author and Iyama. We also show the existence of a left Calabi-Yau structure on the dg bounded derived category of $Λ$. This is a non-commutative generalization of a result by Brav and Dyckerhoff. By combining the existence of the right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category with a structure theorem by Keller and the second-named author, we deduce that under suitable hypotheses, the singularity category associated with $Λ$ is triangle equivalent to a generalized cluster category in the sense of Amiot.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As one of results in [6], Bridgeland realized the quantum group $\mathbf{U}_v$ via the localization of Ringel-Hall algebra for the two-periodic projective complexes of quiver representations over a finite field.

In particular, we obtain a basis of the Ringel-Hall algebra for the two-periodic projective complexes which has the positivity, and we categorify an integral form of the generic Bridgeland's Hall algebra which is isomorphic to the Poisson integral form of $\mathbf{U}_v$, and obtain a $\mathbb{Z}[v,v^{-1}]$-basis of this integral form.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, assuming the weak Schanuel Conjecture (WSC), we prove that for any collection of pairwise non-arithmetically equivalent totally real number fields, the residues at $s=1$ of their Dedekind zeta functions form a linearly independent set over the field of algebraic numbers. As a corollary, we obtain that, under WSC, two totally real number fields have the same regulator if and only if they have the same class number and Dedekind zeta function. We also prove that, under WSC, the isometry and similarity classes of the log unit lattice of a real Galois number field of degree $[K:\Q]\geq 4$, characterize the isomorphism class of said field. All of our results follow from establishing that, under WSC, any Gram matrix of the log unit lattice of a real Galois number field yields a generic point of certain closed irreducible $\Q$-subvariety of the space of symmetric matrices of appropriate size.</p></details>

Using the interpretation of Brauer classes as obstructions to descending determinantal line bundles from the algebraic closure, together with a geometric analysis of the moduli space of twisted sheaves, we prove that for genus $2$ curves there exist Brauer classes over the base field whose period equals their index. Over $C_1$-fields, we further show that every $2$-torsion class in the Brauer group of a genus $2$ curve satisfies the period-index problem. As an application, we construct higher-dimensional varieties obtained as fibre products of genus $2$ curves over $C_1$-fields whose $2$-torsion algebraic Brauer classes also satisfy the period-index problem, providing new evidence toward the period-index conjecture.</p></details>

Over a finite field this bijection implies that the probability that an operator be nilpotent is the reciprocal of the number of vectors in $V$. We generalize this correspondence to pairs of operators between pairs of vector spaces and determine the probability that a random pair of operators be nilpotent. We also determine the set-theoretical counterpart of this construction and compute the number of eventually constant pairs of maps between two finite sets, closely related to the number of spanning trees in a complete bipartite graph.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a number field with a finite set $S$ of primes. We study the cohomology of $\mathbb{F}_p[G_{K,S}]$-modules $A$, in particular the Shafarevich groups $\Sha^i_S(K,A)$ for $i=1,2$ for tame sets $S$, i.e., for sets $S$ that contain no primes above $p$. When $S$ contains all primes above $p$ (the ``wild'' setting), it is a consequence of global Poitou-Tate duality that $\Sha^1_S(K,A')^\vee \simeq \Sha^2_S(K,A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\hookrightarrow} \RusB_S(K,A) $ is non-increasing as $S$ increases. The same applies when $G_{K,S}$ is replaced by its maximal pro-$p$ quotient $G_{K,S}(p)$. In [4] it was shown that for $S$ tame and $A=\mathbb{F}_p$ with trivial action, the group $\Sha^2_S(K, A)$ can increase as $S$ increases to $S\cup X$, and even attain its maximal dimension, $\dim_{\mathbb{F}_p} \RusB_S(K,\mathbb{F}_p)$, for carefully chosen $X$. We strengthen this to general $\mathbb{F}_p[G_{K,S}]$-modules $A$ where $S$ is tame. We use Liu's definition [7] of $\RusB_S(K,A)$ to show that $\Sha^2_S(K,A) \hookrightarrow \RusB_S(K,A)$ and that there exist infinitely many tame sets of primes $X$ of $K$ such that $\Sha^2_{S\cup X}(K,A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\hookrightarrow} \RusB_{S \cup X}(K,A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\twoheadleftarrow} \RusB_S(K,A) \hookleftarrow \Sha^2_S(K,A)$.</p></details>

Degeneracy leads to some interesting challenges when computing Sato-Tate groups, and there are currently few examples and techniques presented in the literature. In this paper we focus on the Jacobians of the family of curves $C_{p^2}: y^2=x^{p^2}-1$, where $p$ is an odd prime. Using a construction developed by Shioda in the 1980s, we are able to characterize so-called indecomposable Hodge classes as well as the Sato-Tate groups of these Jacobian varieties. Our work is inspired by computation, and examples and methods are described throughout the paper.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Bateman--Horn Conjecture predicts how often an irreducible polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ assumes prime values. We demonstrate that with sufficient averaging in the coefficients of $f$ (viz. exponential in the size of the inputs), one can not only prove Bateman--Horn results on average but also pin down precise information about the distribution of prime values. We show that 100\% of polynomials (in an $L^k$ sense for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$) satisfy the Bateman--Horn Conjecture, and that that 100\% of polynomials (in an $L^2$ sense) satisfy an appropriate polynomial analogue of the Hardy--Littlewood Prime Tuples Conjecture. We use the latter to prove that 100\% of polynomials satisfy the appropriate analogue of the Poisson Tail Conjecture, in the sense that the distribution of the gaps between consecutive prime values around the average spacing is Poisson. We also study the frequencies of sign patterns of the Liouville function evaluated at the consecutive outputs of $f$; viewing $f$ as a random variable, we establish the limiting distribution for every sign pattern. The Chowla problem along random polynomials is a special case. A key input behind all of our arguments is Leng's recent quantitative work on the higher-order Fourier uniformity of the von Mangoldt and Möbius functions (in turn relying on Leng, Sah, and Sawhney's quantitative inverse theorem for the Gowers norms).</p></details>

We obtain a power saving over the local bound of Eswarathasan and Pramanik for the $L^2$ norm of $ψ$ with respect to $μ$, which is a weighted generalization of Marshall's geodesic restriction bound and is proved by applying the method of arithmetic amplification. On a general 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold, we also obtain a Kakeya-Nikodym bound for the $L^2$ norm of any Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunction with respect to a Borel measure supported on a geodesic segment with dimension greater than 1/2.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The distribution of prime constellations, such as Twin Primes ($p, p+2$), is traditionally analyzed via probabilistic models or analytic sieve theory. While heuristic predictions are accurate, rigorous proofs are obstructed by the "Parity Barrier", which prevents classical sieves from distinguishing primes from semi-primes in the asymptotic limit. In this work, we present a structural proof of existence based on deterministic signal processing. We treat the sequence of integers as a signal generated by a rigid Diophantine basis ($N=2n+3m$) and define a fundamental certification window $\mathcal{W} = [P, m_0^2)$ derived from the basis limit $m_0$. We demonstrate that the non-existence of constellations (the "Null Hypothesis") constitutes a low-entropy signal state, a "Prime Desert", that requires infinite spectral resolution to maintain over a quadratic window. Since the sieving basis is finite ($p \le m_0$), the system is band-limited and structurally incapable of synthesizing the destructive interference required to sustain a zero count. By invoking the Chinese Remainder Theorem and analyzing the detailed correlation structure of residue classes, we prove that positive and negative correlations between sieved positions cancel at leading order, constraining the variance of the signal to scale linearly with the mean ($O(μ)$) rather than the quadratic scaling ($Ω(μ^2)$) required to support a Prime Desert. This Variance Gap implies that the signal must strictly oscillate around its mean, rendering the existence of prime constellations a mandatory consequence of the system's finite spectral bandwidth.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a finite-dimensional representation $V$ over an algebraically closed field of an abstract group $G$, we consider the number of the trivial summand counted with multiplicity in the direct sum decomposition of $V^{\otimes n}$. We give necessary and sufficient conditions when the field is of characteristic $0$ and when the field is of characteristic $p$ so that $(V^{\otimes n})_n$ has a subsequence $(V^{\otimes n_k})_k$ such that $V^{\otimes n_k}$ contains enough trivial summands when $k$ is sufficiently large.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the Diophantine equation $$ a!b! = c! $$ due to Erdős, where we assume $a \leq b$. It is widely believed that there are only finitely many nontrivial solutions, and considerable work has been dedicated to showing this. In one direction, Luca (2007) showed that the set of $c$'s which can appear in solutions has density zero. Here we show that the set of $a$'s appearing in solutions is also sparse. In particular, $a$ cannot be one less than a large fraction of primes, and, under the assumption that $\sqrt[k]{a!} \mod 1$ is equidistributed in an appropriate sense, we show that the set of such $a$ has asymptotic density zero.</p></details>
