### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21702v1'>2510.21702</a>\]&nbsp; **The Local-Global Conjecture is False for Generalized Circle Packings**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hanqi Shi, Wenyuan Shi, Ian Whitehead, Ham Williams-Tracy, Jeffrey Zhirui Zhang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Haag, Kertzer, Rickards, and Stange disprove the Local-Global Conjecture for Apollonian circle packings. We extend their disproof to four more types of integral circle packing: the octahedral, cubic, square, and triangular packings. In each case, we find quadratic invariants which imply quadratic reciprocity obstructions to the conjecture in certain packings. We utilize an explicit parametrization of circles tangent to a fixed circle in each packing type, and a quadratic reciprocity argument. Even in the packings where we do not find quadratic obstructions, the curvatures exhibit a predictable reciprocity structure. This leads to partial obstructions on integers appearing as curvatures in subsets of the packing.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use Lazard's universal $\pi$-ring to construct a variation of the $\pi$-typical ramified Witt vector functors, which we call the Lazardian Witt vector functor. We then use the Lazardian Witt vector functor to construct the universal residual perfection of a Lazardian algebra.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Xingyu Cheng, Reese Lance, Nikhil Nagabandi, Andrey Smirnov &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math-ph &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider quantum difference equation (QDE) for equivariant quantum K-theory of the Grassmannian. In this paper we obtain a solution to the QDE and use the solution to asymptotically derive the Bethe ansatz equations. In the limit, we obtain similar results for the cohomological analogue. For both cases, we describe the nonequivariant solutions as well. As an application, we identify the quantum K-theory ring of $\mathrm{Gr}(k,n)$ with a quantum 5 vertex XXZ integrable spin chain.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zheng Liu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct Hida families of theta lifts from definite orthogonal and unitary groups. A major ingredient of the construction is the choice of test Schwartz functions at places dividing $p$. We select a special type of Schwartz functions endowed with the equivariance property for the action of $\mathbb{U}_p$-operators.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Matthew Crawford, Pavan Kartik, Reese Lance &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider cohomological stable envelopes for a natural torus action $\mathsf{T}$ on $X=T^*Gr(k,n)$, introduced by Maulik-Okounkov. We define the $\mathbb{C}^*_\hbar$-equivariant integral of the stable envelope using equivariant localization over the subtorus $\mathbb{C}^*_\hbar\subset\mathsf{T}$, and compute the integral as a non-equivariant limit of the localization over the full torus, $\mathsf{T}$. The integral of such a class is an integer times a power of $\hbar$, and the main result of this paper is a combinatorial formula for these integers. In 3d mirror symmetry, these non-equivariant limits are expected to reflect some curve counting phenomena on the 3d mirror dual, $X^\vee$. When $k=1$, we obtain the binomial coefficients, and we study some of the combinatorics of the integers for higher $k$, which haven't appeared in the literature before. We give some conjectures and interpretations on extending this phenomena to type A quiver and bow varieties.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Thomas Agugliaro &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 29 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the standard conjecture of Hodge type holds for powers of abelian threefolds. Along the way, we also prove the conjecture for powers of simple abelian variety of prime dimension over finite fields, and in other related cases based on the notion of Frobenius rank of Lenstra-Zarhin. The main tool is a result comparing two real fiber functors on tannakian categories. A second tool is a new an explicit description of simple Lefschetz motives over finite fields, in terms of ''enriched'' Frobenius eigenvalues.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 28 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the representation of arbitrary polynomials using probabilistic Bernoulli and degenerate Bernoulli polynomials associated with a random variable $Y$, whose moment generating function exists in a neighborhood of the origin. In addition, this paper explores the problem of representing arbitrary polynomials in terms of their higher-order counterparts. We develop explicit formulas for those representations with the help of umbral calculus and illustrate our results for several discrete and continuous random variables Y.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Dohyeong Kim, Jungwon Lee, Seonhee Lim &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DS &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 40 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The distributional analysis of Euclidean algorithms was carried out by Baladi and Vall\'{e}e. They showed the asymptotic normality of the number of division steps and associated costs in the Euclidean algorithm as a random variable on the set of rational numbers with bounded denominator based on the transfer operator methods. We extend their result to the Euclidean algorithm over appropriate imaginary quadratic fields by studying dynamics of the nearest integer complex continued fraction map, which is piecewise analytic and expanding but not a full branch map. By observing a finite Markov partition with a regular CW-structure, which enables us to associate the transfer operator acting on a direct sum of spaces of $C^1$-functions, we obtain the limit Gaussian distribution as well as residual equidistribution.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sami Vihko &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** This is a revised and corrected version of arXiv:2506.16115. A new section about convergence on the half plane to the right from the critical line has also been added. 23 pages + references

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we prove that the Dirichlet $L$-functions $L(1/2+ix,\chi_q)$, where $\chi_q$ is uniformly random Dirichlet character modulo $q$ and $x\in \mathbb{R}$, converges to a random Schwartz distribution $\zeta_{\mathrm{rand}}$, which is related to (complex) Gaussian multiplicative chaos. This is the same limiting object that appeared in [34], where the authors proved that the random shifts of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line $\zeta(1/2+ix+i\omega T)$, where $\omega\sim \mathrm{Unif} ([0,1])$, converge as $T\to \infty$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Wei He, Jungwon Lee &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Inspired by the work of Deninger, we present a formula that relates the Mahler measure of a two-variable variant of cyclotomic polynomial to regulator of class in motivic cohomology associated to cyclotomic fields and linear combination of special values of the derivative of Dirichlet $L$-functions. The formula is derived by studying the Beilinson regulator map applied to systematically constructed elements in the motivic cohomology group. Under linear independence hypothesis on the derivative of partial Dirichlet $L$-values at $s=0$ and $-1$, we study a Galois module structure of the relevant motivic cohomology and obtain the refined identity for a single $L$-value.</p></details>
