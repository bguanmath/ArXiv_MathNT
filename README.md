### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06192v1'>2510.06192</a>\]&nbsp; **Ratios of two exponents of van der Laan-Padovan numbers**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tomohiro Yamada &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 15 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The van der Laan-Padovan sequence $P_n ~ (n=0, 1, \ldots)$ is defined by $P_0=1, P_1=P_2=0$, and $P_{n+3}=P_{n+1}+P_n$ for $n=0, 1, \ldots$. We determine all pairs $(P_m, P_n)$ satisfying $P_m^b/P_n^a=2^{g_1} 3^{g_2} 5^{g_3} 7^{g_4}$ for some integers $g_1, g_2, g_3, g_4$, $a$, and $b$. More generally, for a linear recurrence sequence $u_n$ satisfying the dominant root condition and a given set of primes $p_1, \ldots, p_k$, there exist only finitely many pairs $(u_m, u_n)$ satisfying $u_m^b/u_n^a=p_1^{g_1} \cdots p_k^{g_k}$ for some integers $g_1, \ldots, g_k$, $a$, and $b$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Will Donovan, Wahei Hara, Michał Kapustka, Marco Rampazzo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 34 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The local simple $9$-fold flop of Grassmannian type is a birational transformation between total spaces of vector bundles on the Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(2, 5)$ and $\mathrm{Gr}(3, 5)$. We produce four different derived equivalences which commute with the pushforward functors for the flopping contractions. These equivalences are realized by identifying four different window categories inside the derived category of coherent sheaves on an Artin stack. As an application, our approach provides a new proof of derived equivalence for a pair of non-birational Calabi-Yau threefolds realized as zero loci of sections of homogeneous vector bundles in Grassmannians.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jonathan W. Bober, Oleksiy Klurman, Besfort Shala &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 34 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove distributional results for mixed character sums \begin{equation*} \sum_{n\le x }\chi(n)e(n\theta), \end{equation*} for fixed $\theta\in [0,1]$ and random character $\chi \pmod q$, as well as for a fixed character $\chi$ and randomly sampled $\theta\in [0,1].$ We present various applications of our results. For example, we construct Littlewood polynomials with large Mahler measure, thus establishing a new record in the Mahler problem (1963). We also show that $L_{2k}$ norms of well-known Turyn polynomials are asymptotically minimized at the shift $\alpha=1/4,$ proving a conjecture of G\"unther and Schmidt. An important ingredient in our work is a general way of dealing with "log-integrability" problems.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Quang-Khai Nguyen &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DS &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the generating series associated with the degree sequence of a monomial self-map of a projective toric variety. We establish conditions under which this series has its circle of convergence as a natural boundary, and hence is a transcendental, non-holonomic function. In the case of toric surfaces, our results are sharp; moreover, we answer a question of Bell by proving that their reductions modulo $p$ are transcendental for all but finitely many prime numbers $p$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** We thank Professor Dr. Shparlinski for kindly pointing out our misuse of the bounds for sums of Kloosterman sums (in Sections 4 and 5). This has been corrected in the revised version v2

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a construction of radial Fourier interpolation formulas in dimensions 3 and 4 using Maass--Poincar\'e type series. As a corollary we obtain explicit formulas for the basis functions of these interpolation formulas in terms of what we call real-variable Kloosterman sums, which were previously introduced by Stoller. We also improve the bounds on the corresponding basis functions $a_{n,d}(x)$, $d=3,4$, for fixed $x$, in terms of the index $n$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 10 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by the recent work of several authors on vanishing coefficients of the arithmetic progression in certain $q$-series expansion, we study some variants of these $q$-series and prove some comparable results. For instance, if $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_1(n)q^n=\left(\pm q^2,\pm q^3; q^5\right)_\infty^2 \left( q, q^{14}; q^{15}\right)_\infty$, then $c_1(5n+3)=0$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05925v1'>2510.05925</a>\]&nbsp; **Cluster theory of topological Fukaya categories. Part II: Higher Teichmüller theory**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Merlin Christ &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 48 pages, comments very welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct relative $3$-Calabi--Yau categories related with higher Teichm\"uller theory. We further study their corresponding cosingularity categories and the additive categorification of the corresponding cluster algebras. The input for our constructions is a marked surface with boundary and a Dynkin quiver $I$. In the case of the triangle, these categories have been described in recent work of Keller--Liu. For general surfaces, the categories are constructed via gluing along a perverse schober, categorifying the amalgamation of cluster varieties. The case $I=A_1$ was subject of the prequel paper. We show that the cosingularity category is equivalent to the corresponding Higgs category and to the topological Fukaya category of the marked surface valued in the $1$-Calabi--Yau cluster category of type $I$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Theorem 3.2 was previously missing the hypothesis that the covers were arithmetically Gorenstein, as pointed out to us by Enrico Schlesinger. We have now added in this hypothesis and issued an erratum for the published version in Compositio

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $2 \leq d \leq 5$, we show that the class of the Hurwitz space of smooth degree $d$, genus $g$ covers of $\mathbb P^1$ stabilizes in the Grothendieck ring of stacks as $g \to \infty$, and we give a formula for the limit. We also verify this stabilization when one imposes ramification conditions on the covers, and obtain a particularly simple answer for this limit when one restricts to simply branched covers.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Vignon Oussa &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.FA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** The proof is almost complete except for the case where $C=0$ which needs to be fully proved. Thus far, the statement holds if the choice afforded by Atkinson's theorem falls on a countable subset of the group. Otherwise, we need to fully complete this part to make the proof as rigorous as possible. More work is in progress to fully substantiate this last part of the result. Stay tuned

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a linear--independence principle for finite families of translates in irreducible, square--integrable modulo the center (SI/Z) representations of step--two nilpotent Lie groups with one--dimensional center. Fix a one--parameter subgroup $\exp(\mathbb R X)$ and a noncentral element $Y$ (not assumed to commute with $X$). For every nonzero smooth vector $f$, any finite collection $\{\pi(\exp(x_k X))f\}_{k=1}^m$ (with distinct parameters $x_k$) of translates along $\exp(\mathbb R X)$, together with the single translate $\pi(\exp Y)f$, is linearly independent. The proof combines Schwartz regularity of matrix coefficients in the noncentral variables with an ergodic log--product estimate on a compact torus generated by commutator phases. As a result, we obtain an HRT--type statement for $(m,1)$ configurations (on--line direction with zero $X_{k_0}$--component and rogue $\exp X_{k_0}$) for all nonzero Schwartz windows, without spacing restrictions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Petar Bakić, Aleksander Horawa, Siyan Daniel Li-Huerta, Naomi Sweeting &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Removed restrictions at the archimedean places. 40 pages. Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cuspidal automorphic representations $\tau$ of $\mathrm{PGL}_2$ correspond to global long root $A$-parameters for $\mathsf{G}_2$. Using an exceptional theta lift between $\mathrm{PU}_3$ and $\mathsf{G}_2$, we construct the associated global $A$-packet and prove the Arthur multiplicity formula for these representations when $\tau$ is dihedral and satisfies some technical hypotheses. We also prove that this subspace of the discrete automorphic spectrum forms a full near equivalence class. Our construction yields new examples of quaternionic modular forms on $\mathsf{G}_2$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Matteo Longo, Paola Magrone, Eduardo Rocha Walchek &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** The results have been reorganized and split in the two preprints: arXiv:2510.04306 and arXiv:2510.04301

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to study the $p$-adic variation of Heegner points and generalized Heegner classes for ordinary families of quaternionic modular forms. We compare classical specializations of big Heegner points (introduced in the quaternionic setting by one of the authors in collaboration with S. Vigni) with generalized Heegner classes, extending a result of Castella to the quaternionic setting. We also compare big Heegner points with $p$-adic families of generalized Heegner classes, introduced in this paper in the quaternionic setting, following works by Jetchev--Loeffler--Zerbes, \cite{JLZ}, B\"{u}y\"{u}kboduk--Lei and Ota. These comparison results are obtained by exploiting the relation between $p$-adic families of generalized Heegner classes and $p$-families of $p$-adic $L$-functions, introduced in this paper following constructions of Brooks and Burungale-Castella-Kim.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper discusses various aspects of the Hecke algebra combinatorics that are related to conditions appearing in K{\aa}hrstr{\"o}m's conjecture that addresses Kostant's problem for simple highest weight modules in the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand category $\mathcal{O}$ for the complex Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_n$. In particular, we study cyclic submodules of the regular Hecke module that are generated by the elements of the (dual) Kazhdan-Lusztig basis as well as the problem of left cell invariance for both categorical and combinatorial K{\aa}hrstr{\"o}m's conditions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Adi Zilka &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 17 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the zeros of modular forms in the Miller basis, a natural basis for the space of modular forms. We show that the zeros of their Faber polynomials have linear moments. By analyzing the moments we can extend the known range of the forms in the Miller basis for which at least one of the zeros is not on the arc - the circular part of the boundary of the fundamental domain. Additionally, for forms in the Miller basis of an index asymptotically linear in the weight such that all zeros are on the arc, we compute the limit distribution of the zeros, which depends on the asymptotic ratio of the index to the weight.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Shunsuke Hirota &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We formulate several basic properties of Verma supermodules over regular symmetrizable Kac--Moody Lie superalgebras, exhibiting $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$-nature as revealed through changing Borel subalgebras. We investigate variants of Verma modules obtained by changing Borel subalgebras, which enable us to realize the principal block of $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ as an extension-closed abelian subcategory of category $\mathcal{O}$. This phenomenon is precisely formulated in terms of semibricks. On the other hand, by applying the exchange property of odd reflections, we describe compositions of homomorphisms between Verma modules associated with different Borel subalgebras that share the same character. As an application, we refine existing results on the associated varieties and projective dimensions of Verma modules.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages, added Corollaries 1.3 and 1.4 and their proofs in section 7

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given positive integers $h, N$ satisfying $1 \leqslant h \leqslant 2N^2$, we define $T(h,N)$ to be the number of $2\times 2$ integer matrices with determinant equal to $h$ whose entries lie in $[-N,N]$. Our first result states that for any $\varepsilon >0$, one has $$ T(h,N) = \frac{16}{\zeta(2)} N^2 \bigg( \sum_{d |h} \frac{1}{d} \bigg) + O_{\varepsilon}(N^{\varepsilon} (N+ h)).$$ This quantitatively improves upon recent work of Afifurrahman and Ganguly--Guria. We further show that when $N^{1 + \delta} \leqslant h \leqslant 2N^2$ for any fixed $\delta>0$, the error term above is of roughly the right order. Our second result delivers an asymptotic formula for $T(h,N)$ with square-root cancellation whenever $h = N^2 + O(N)$. This error term is much stronger than its corresponding analogue in the smoothened version of this problem. More generally, for any $\varepsilon >0$ and any $N,h \in \mathbb{N}$ with $1\leq h \leq 2N^2$, we prove that $$ T(h,N) = \bigg( \frac{8}{\zeta(2)} - 4 \bigg)N^2 \bigg( \sum_{d |h} \frac{1}{d} \bigg) + O_{\varepsilon}(N^{\varepsilon}(N+ |h-N^2|)). $$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We generalize Koyama's $7/10$ bound of the error term in the prime geodesic theorems to the principal congruence subgroups for quaternion algebras. Our method avoids the spectral side of the Jacquet--Langlands correspondences, and relates the counting function directly to those for the principal congruence subgroups of Eichler orders of level less than one.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Andrew Goodall, Florent Jouve, Jean-Sébastien Sereni &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study algebraic properties of the Tutte polynomial of a matroid and its generalizations to other combinatorially defined bivariate polynomial invariants. Merino, de Mier and Noy showed that the Tutte polynomial of a connected matroid is irreducible, and Bohn, Cameron and M{\"u}ller conjectured the stronger property that the Galois/monodromy group of the Tutte polynomial of a connected matroid of rank r is isomorphic to the full symmetric group on r letters. First, we generalize the result of Merino-de Mier-Noy to the context of general ranked sets by exploiting a recent translation of the Brylawski relations, satisfied by the coefficients of the Tutte polynomial, into a functional identity. Second, we give the first confirmation of the conjecture of Bohn-Cameron-M{\"u}ller for infinite families of connected matroids, including the cycle graphs and the uniform matroids. Moreover, we apply the large sieve to obtain a probabilistic statement showing that suitable linear combinations of coprime Tutte polynomials generically satisfy the conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For integers $x$ and $y$, $(x, y)$ and $[x, y]$ stand for the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of $x$ and $y$ respectively. Denote by $|T|$ the number of elements of a finite set $T$. Let $a,b$ and $n$ be positive integers and let $S=\{x_1, \cdots, x_n\}$ be a set of $n$ distinct positive integers. We denote by $(S^a)$ (resp. $[S^a]$) the $n\times n$ matrix having the $a$th power of $(x_i,x_j)$ (resp. $[x_i,x_j]$) as its $(i,j)$-entry. For any $x\in S$, define $G_{S}(x):=\{d\in S: d<x, d|x \ {\rm and} \ (d|y|x, y\in S) \Rightarrow y\in \{d,x\}\}$. In this paper, we show that if $a|b$ and $S$ is gcd closed (namely, $(x_i, x_j)\in S$ for all integers $i$ and $j$ with $1\le i, j\le n$) and $\max_{x\in S}\{|G_S (x)|\}=3$ such that any elements $y_1,y_2\in G_S(x)$ satisfy that $[y_1,y_2]=x$ and $(y_1,y_2)\in G_S(y_1)\cap G_S(y_2)$), then $(S^a)|(S^b)$, $(S^a)|[S^b]$ and $[S^a]|[S^b]$ hold in the ring $M_{n}({\mathbb Z})$. This extends the Chen-Hong-Zhao theorem gotten in 2022. This also partially confirms a conjecture of Hong raised in [S.F. Hong, Divisibility among power GCD matrices and power LCM matrices, {\it Bull. Aust. Math. Soc.}, doi:10.1017/S0004972725100361].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $d\ge3$ and $\mathbb{F}_q^{d}$ be the $d$-dimensional vector space over a finite field of order $q$, where $q$ is a prime power. Fix a slice $\pi=\{x_d=\lambda\}$ of the unit sphere $S^{d-1}=\{x\colon ||x||=1\}$ and let $X_\pi$ be the set of lines through the origin meeting $\pi\cap S^{d-1}$. For $E\subset\mathbb{F}_q^{d}$ and $N\ge1$, we study the exceptional sets $$ \mathcal{T}_1(X_\pi,E,N)=\bigl\{V\in X_\pi:\ |\pi_V(E)|\le N\bigr\},\qquad \mathcal{T}_2(X_\pi,E,N)=\bigl\{V\in X_\pi:\ |\pi_{V^\perp}(E)|\le N\bigr\}, $$ on their respective natural ranges of $N$. Using discrete Fourier analysis together with restriction/extension estimates for cone and sphere type quadrics over finite fields, we obtain sharp bounds (up to constant factors) for $\lvert \mathcal{T}_1\rvert$ and $\lvert \mathcal{T}_2\rvert$, with separate treatment of the special slices $\lambda=\pm1$ and of the isotropic slice $\lambda=0$. The bounds exhibit arithmetic-geometric dichotomies absent in the full Grassmannian: the quadratic character of $\lambda^{2}-1$ and the parity of $d$ determine the size of the exceptional sets. As an application, when $|E|\ge q$, there exists a positive proportion of elements $\mathbf{y}\in X_\pi$ such that the pinned dot-product sets $\{\mathbf{y}\cdot \mathbf{x}\colon \mathbf{x}\in E\}$ are of cardinality $\Omega(q)$. We further treat analogous families arising from the spheres of radii $0$ and $-1$, and by combining these slices, recover the known estimates for projections over the full Grassmannian, complementing a result of Chen (2018).</p></details>

> **Comment:** 83 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This work investigates the vertical quantum cohomology and quantum spectra of flag bundles, uncovering new links between the Gromov-Witten theory of homogeneous fibrations and analytic number theory. Building on previous constructions by Astashkevich and Sadov (arXiv:hep-th/9401103) and by Biswas, Das, Oh, and Paul (arXiv:2408.06616), we establish functorial and inductive properties of vertical quantum cohomology, and relate the vertical and absolute quantum spectra. We show that the degeneracy of the small vertical quantum spectrum of a Grassmann bundle - namely, the appearance of eigenvalues with unexpectedly high multiplicities - is controlled by the prime factorization of the involved ranks. This extends earlier results for Grassmannians to the relative setting and applies, in particular, to partial flag varieties viewed as total spaces of Grassmann bundles. We then introduce three families of double sequences that classify partial flag varieties according to distinct quantum spectral and combinatorial features. Their recursive and arithmetic behavior is studied through ordinary and Dirichlet generating functions. One of these sequences satisfies a Pascal-type recursion, allowing a precise analysis of its partial Dirichlet series, whose analytic continuation exhibits logarithmic singularities determined by the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Moreover, for any fixed integer shift, the diagonal subsequences display eventual polynomial behavior, which admits a natural interpretation in terms of weighted walks on graphs. Finally, we examine the vanishing pattern of one of these sequences and derive equivalent formulations of Goldbach's conjecture. Overall, the paper reveals a rich correspondence between enumerative geometry, quantum spectral degeneracy, and classical problems in prime number theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>[This is an older version of the paper, which will be updated soon.] In the present paper, we continue our research on the generalized Fermat equation $x^r + y^s = z^t$ with signature $(r, s, t)$, where $r, s, t \ge 2$ are positive integers such that $\frac{1}{r} + \frac{1}{s} + \frac{1}{t} < 1$. All known positive primitive solutions for the generalized Fermat equation when $\frac{1}{r} + \frac{1}{s} + \frac{1}{t} < 1$ are related to the Catalan solutions $1^n + 2^3 = 3^2$ and nine non-Catalan solutions. By applying inter-universal Teichm\"uller theory and its slight modification in the case of elliptic curves over rational numbers, we deduce that the generalized Fermat equation $x^r + y^s = z^t$ has no non-trivial primitive solution except for those related to the Catalan solutions and nine non-Catalan solutions mentioned above, when $(r, s, t)$ is not a permutation of the following signatures: $\bullet$ $(4,5,n)$, $(4,7,n)$, $(5,6,n)$, with $7 \le n \le 303$. $\bullet$ $(2,3,n)$, $(3,4,n)$, $(3,8,n)$, $(3,10,n)$, with $11\le n \le 109$ or $n\in \{113, 121\}$. $\bullet$ $(3,5,n)$, with $7\le n \le 3677$; $(3,7,n)$, $(3,11,n)$, with $11 \le n \le 667$. $\bullet$ $(3,m,n)$, with $13 \le m \le 17$, $m < n \le 29$; $(2,m,n)$, with $m \ge 5$, $n\ge 7$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G=GL(n)$ be the $n\times n$ complex general linear group and let $\mathcal{B}_{n}$ be its flag variety. The standard Borel subgroup $B$ of upper triangular matrices acts on the product $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ with finitely many orbits. In this paper, we study the $B$-orbits on the subvarieties $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times \mathcal{O}_{i}$, where $\mathcal{O}_{i}$ is the $B$-orbit on $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ containing the line through the origin in the direction of the $i$-th standard basis vector of $\mathbb{C}^{n}$. For each $i=1,\dots, n$, we construct a bijection between $B$-orbits on $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathcal{O}_{i}$ and certain pairs of Schubert cells in $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathcal{B}_{n}$. We also show that this bijection can be used to understand the Richardson-Springer monoid action on such $B$-orbits in terms of the classical monoid action of the symmetric group on itself. We also develop combinatorial models of these orbits and use these models to compute exponential generating functions for the sequences $\{|B\backslash(\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathcal{O}_{i})|\}_{n\geq 1}$ and $\{|B\backslash (\mathcal{B}_{n}\times \mathbb{P}^{n-1})|\}_{n\geq 1}$. In the sequel to this paper, we use the results of this paper to construct a correspondence between $B$-orbits on $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ and a collection of $B$-orbits on the flag variety $\mathcal{B}_{n+1}$ of $GL(n+1)$ and show that this correspondence respects closures relations and preserves monoid actions. As a consequence both closure relations and monoid actions for all $B$-orbits on $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ can be understood via the Bruhat order by using our results in [CE].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, Wiles deployed a commutative algebra technique, namely a numerical criterion for detecting isomorphisms of rings. In our recent work we pick up on Wiles' work and generalize the numerical criterion to ``higher codimension''. A critical ingredient is a notion of congruence module in higher codimension: this has turned out to be a key definition whose utility extends beyond the role it plays in the numerical criterion. In this paper we trace the origin of some of the ideas that led to our work, both in number theory and commutative algebra, and new directions that emerge from it. We introduce a related notion of a congruence ideal, develop some commutative algebra needed to work with it, and hint at applications to number theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The plethysm product of Schur functions corresponds to composing polynomial representations of infinite general linear groups. Finding the plethysm coefficients $\langle s_\nu \circ s_\mu, s_\lambda\rangle$ that express an arbitrary plethysm $s_\nu \circ s_\mu$ as a sum $\sum_\lambda \langle s_\nu \circ s_\mu, s_\lambda \rangle s_\lambda$ of Schur functions is a fundamental open problem in algebraic combinatorics. We prove two stability theorems for plethysm coefficients under the operations of adding and/or joining an arbitrary partition to either $\mu$ or $\nu$. In both theorems $\mu$ may be replaced with an arbitrary skew partition. As special cases we obtain all stability results on the plethysm product of two Schur functions in the literature to date. The proofs are entirely combinatorial using plethystic semistandard tableaux with positive and negative entries.</p></details>

This is a new proof of Ramanujan's congruences modulo 5, 7, and 11, as there are no nontrivial cusp forms of weight 4, 6, and 10.</p></details>

However, for general algebraic LRS of order 4 the question of decidability has remained open.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By a classic theorem of Beilinson, the perfect derived category $\mathrm{Perf}(\mathbb{P}^n)$ of projective space is equivalent to the category of derived representations of a certain quiver with relations. The vertex-wise tensor product of quiver representations corresponds to a symmetric monoidal structure $\otimes_{\mathsf{Q}}$ on $\mathrm{Perf}(\mathbb{P}^n)$. We prove that, for a certain choice of equivalence, the symmetric monoidal structure $\otimes_{\mathsf{Q}}$ may be described geometrically as an \emph{extended convolution product} in the sense that the Fourier--Mukai kernel is given by the closure of the torus multiplication map in $(\mathbb{P}^n)^3$. We also set up a general framework for such problems, allowing us to generalize the extended convolution description of quiver tensor products to the case where $\mathbb{P}^n$ is replaced by any smooth complete toric variety of Bondal--Ruan type. Under toric mirror symmetry, this extended convolution product corresponds to the tensor product of constructible sheaves on a real torus. As another generalization of our results for $\mathbb{P}^n$, we show that any finite-dimensional algebra $A$ gives rise to a monoidal structure $\star_A'$ on $\mathrm{Perf}(\mathbb{P}(A))$, providing insights into the moduli of monoidal structures on $\mathrm{Perf}(\mathbb{P}^n)$.</p></details>

The latter duality is proved by passing, via comparison theorems, to analogous sheaves representing syntomic cohomology and then reducing to Poincar\'e duality for ${\mathbf B}^+_{\rm st}$-twisted Hyodo-Kato and filtered $\mathbf{B}^+_{\rm dr}$-cohomologies that, in turn, reduce to Serre duality for smooth Stein varieties -- a classical result.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Ramanujan derived a sequence of even weight $2n$ quasimodular forms $U_{2n}(q)$ from derivatives of Jacobi's weight $3/2$ theta function. Using the generating function for this sequence, one can construct sequences of quasimodular forms of all nonnegative integer weights with minimal input: a weight 1 modular form and a power series $F(X)$. Using the weight 1 form $\theta(q)^2$ and $F(X)=\exp(X/2)$, we obtain a sequence $\{Y_n(q)\}$ of weight $n$ quasimodular forms on $\Gamma_0(4)$ whose symmetric function avatars $\widetilde{Y}_n(\pmb{x}^k)$ are the symmetric polynomials $T_n(\pmb{x}^k)$ that arise naturally in the study of syzygies of numerical semigroups. With this information, we settle two conjectures about the $T_n(\pmb{x}^k).$ Finally, we note that these polynomials are systematically given in terms of the Borel-Hirzebruch $\widehat{A}$-genus for spin manifolds, where one identifies power sum symmetric functions $p_i$ with Pontryagin classes.</p></details>

For $n=1$ we determine the sharp region of exponents $(u_1,u_2)$ for which the associated bilinear projection form is bounded uniformly in $q$, namely $$ \frac{1}{u_1}+\frac{2}{u_2}\le 2 \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{2}{u_1}+\frac{1}{u_2}\le 2, $$ which includes the endpoint $L^{3/2}\times L^{3/2}\to L^1$. For general $n$ we prove a multilinear estimate at the critical exponent $$ u=\frac{n(2n+1)}{n+1}, $$ via an induction on $n$ that exploits the group's fiber structure together with multilinear interpolation. Specializing to indicators yields a sharp Loomis--Whitney type set inequality that controls $|K|$ for every finite $K\subset \mathbb{H}^n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ by the sizes of its $2n$ Heisenberg projections $\{\pi_j(K)\}$, forcing a large projection in every configuration. A straightening map then converts these bounds into covering statements by additive cosets and provides a new approach to the orthogonal projection problem onto the vertical hyperplanes $\{x_j=0\}$, which presents an interesting link between commutative and non-commutative settings. The obtained results are optimal up to absolute constants, and in the planar case $n=1$, when the size of the set is not too small, our bound can be sharpened further using a point--line incidence estimate.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose an extension of the theory of parity sheaves, which allows for non-locally constant sheaves along strata. Our definition is tailored for proving the existence of (proper, quasihereditary, etc) stratifications of $\mathrm{Ext}$-algebras. We use this to study quiver Schur algebras $A(\alpha)$ for the cyclic quiver of length $2$. We find a polynomial quasihereditary structure on $A(\alpha)$ compatible with the categorified PBW basis of McNamara and Kleshchev-Muth, and sharpen their results to arbitrary characteristic. We also prove that semicuspidal algebras of $A(n\delta)$ are polynomial quasihereditary covers of semicuspidal algebras of the corresponding KLR algebra $R(n\delta)$, and compute them diagrammatically.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ and $B$ be sets in a finite vector space. In this paper, we study the magnitude of the set $A\cap f(B)$, where $f$ runs through a set of transformations. More precisely, we will focus on the cases that the set of transformations is given by orthogonal matrices or orthogonal projections. We prove that if $A, B\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ satisfy some natural conditions, then, for almost every $g\in O(d)$, there are at least $\gg q^d$ elements $z\in \mathbb{F}_q^d$ such that $$|A\cap (g(B)+z)| \sim \frac{|A||B|}{q^d}.$$ This implies that $|A-gB|\gg q^d$ for almost every $g\in O(d)$. In the flavor of expanding functions, with $|A|\le |B|$, we also show that the image $A-gB$ grows exponentially. In two dimensions, the result simply says that if $|A|=q^x$ and $|B|=q^y$, as long as $0<x\le y<2$, then for almost every $g\in O(2)$, we can always find $\epsilon=\epsilon(x, y)>0$ such that $|A-gB|\gg |B|^{1+\epsilon}$. To prove these results, we need to develop new and robust incidence bounds between points and rigid motions by using a number of techniques including algebraic methods and discrete Fourier analysis. Our results are essentially sharp in odd dimensions. In the prime field plane, we further employ recent $L^2$ distance bounds and point-line/plane incidence machinery to derive improvements. Notable applications include a strong prime field analogue of a question of Mattila related to the Falconer distance problem, the Rotational Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance problem, and a quadratic expansion law. Taken together, the results in this paper present a robust two-way link between intersection phenomena and distance problems over finite fields, with dimension-uniform consequences and sharpness in several ranges.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Horn's problem is concerned with characterizing the eigenvalues $(a,b,c)$ of Hermitian matrices $(A,B,C)$ satisfying the constraint $A+B=C$ and forming the edges of a triangle in the space of Hermitian matrices. It has deep connections to tensor product invariants, Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, geometric invariant theory and the intersection theory of Schubert varieties. This paper concerns the tetrahedral Horn problem which aims to characterize the tuples of eigenvalues $(a,b,c,d,e,f)$ of Hermitian matrices $(A,B,C,D,E,F)$ forming the edges of a tetrahedron, and thus satisfying the constraints $A+B=C$, $B+D=F$, $D+C=E$ and $A+F=E$. Here we derive new inequalities satisfied by the Schur-polynomials of such eigenvalues and, using eigenvalue estimation techniques from quantum information theory, prove their satisfaction up to degree $k$ implies the existence of approximate solutions with error $O(\ln k / k)$. Moreover, the existence of these tetrahedra is related to the semiclassical asymptotics of the $6j$-symbols for the unitary group $U(n)$, which are maps between multiplicity spaces that encode the associativity relation for tensor products of irreducible representations. Using our techniques, we prove the asymptotics of norms of these $6j$-symbols are either inverse-polynomial or exponential depending on whether there exists such tetrahedra of Hermitian matrices.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 31 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study $2$-representation finite $\mathbb{K}$-algebras obtained from tensor products of tensor algebras of species. In earlier work we computed the higher preprojective algebra of said algebras to be given as Jacobian algebras of certain species with potential $(S, W)$, which are self-injective and finite dimensional. Truncating these Jacobian algebras yields a rich source of $2$-representation finite $\mathbb{K}$-algebras. Under suitable assumptions, we prove that the set of all cuts of $(S, W)$ is transitive under successive cut-mutations. Furthermore, we show that cuts and cut-mutation correspond to truncated Jacobian algebras and $2$-APR tilting, respectively. Consequently, under certain assumptions, all truncated Jacobian algebras are related to each other via $2$-APR tilting. We produce various new examples of $2$-representation finite $\mathbb{K}$-algebras.</p></details>

The result is based on bounds on the trace of the heat kernel, allowing control of the large time behaviour of certain orbital integrals, as well as a careful analysis of error terms. The result requires the existence of $\lambda$-strongly acyclic representations, which we define and show exists in plenitude for any $\lambda>0$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(x, y)$ and $[x, y]$ denote the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of the integers $x$ and $y$ respectively. We denote by $|T|$ the number of elements of a finite set $T$. Let $a,b$ and $n$ be positive integers and let $S=\{x_1, ..., x_n\}$ be a set of $n$ distinct positive integers. We denote by $(S^a)$ (resp. $[S^a]$) the $n\times n$ matrix whose $(i,j)$-entry is the $a$th power of $(x_i,x_j)$ (resp. $[x_i,x_j]$). For any $x\in S$, define $G_{S}(x):=\{d\in S: d<x, d|x \ {\rm and} \ (d|y|x, y\in S)\Rightarrow y\in \{d,x\}\}$. In this paper, we show that if $a|b$ and $S$ is gcd closed (namely, $(x_i, x_j)\in S$ for all integers $i$ and $j$ with $1\le i, j\le n$) and $\max_{x\in S}\{|G_S (x)|\}=2$ and the condition $\mathcal{G}$ being satisfied (i.e., any element $x\in S$ satisfies that either $|G_S(x)|\le 1$, or $G_S(x)=\{y_1,y_2\}$ satisfying that $[y_1,y_2]=x$ and $(y_1,y_2)\in G_S(y_1)\cap G_S(y_2)$), then $(S^a)|(S^b), (S^a)|[S^b]$ and $[S^a]|[S^b]$ hold in the ring $M_{n}({\bf Z})$. Furthermore, we show the existences of gcd-closed sets $S$ such that $S$ does not satisfy the condition $\mathcal{G}$ and such factorizations are true. Our result extends the Feng-Hong-Zhao theorem gotten in 2009. This also partially confirms a conjecture raised by Hong in [S.F.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider skew-symmetrizable (upper) cluster algebras with a compatible Poisson structure, called $\mathsf{\Lambda}$-(upper) cluster algebras. For any two good elements (e.g., cluster monomials) in a $\mathsf{\Lambda}$-upper cluster algebra, we introduce two invariants, called tropical invariant and $F$-invariant. We prove that (i) the product of two cluster monomials is still a cluster monomial if and only if their $F$-invariant is zero; (ii) if two cluster variables are log-canonical, then they are contained in the same cluster; and (iii) the notion of $F$-invariant for a pair of cluster monomials can be defined for any (upper) cluster algebra, regardless of whether it is a $\mathsf{\Lambda}$-(upper) cluster algebra. When restricting to cluster monomials, we prove that the tropical invariant and $F$-invariant respectively coincide with the $\Lambda$-invariant and twice $\mathfrak{d}$-invariant in the monoidal cluster categorification using various monoidal subcategories of finite-dimensional modules over quantum affine algebras and quiver Hecke algebras; and we prove that the $F$-invariant coincides with the $E$-invariant in the additive cluster categorification using the theory of quivers with potentials. Inspired by $F$-invariant, we introduce the dominant sets for seeds of cluster algebras as a replacement of torsion classes for $\tau$-tilting pairs in $\tau$-tilting theory. With the help of the dominant sets, we prove that the oriented exchange graphs of cluster algebras are acyclic. In particular, this implies that green mutations induce a partial order on the set of seeds (up to seed equivalence) of cluster algebras. We prove that the oriented exchange graphs of cluster algebras coincide with the Hasse quivers of the above posets of seeds.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Peter Scholze has raised the question whether some variant of the $q$-de Rham complex is already defined over the Habiro ring $\mathcal H = \lim_{m\in\mathbb N}\mathbb Z[q]_{(q^m-1)}^\wedge$. We show that such a variant exists whenever the $q$-de Rham complex can be equipped with a "$q$-Hodge filtration": a $q$-deformation of the Hodge filtration, subject to some reasonable conditions. To any such $q$-Hodge filtration we associate a small modification of the $q$-de Rham complex, which we call the $q$-Hodge complex, and show that it descends canonically to the Habiro ring. This construction recovers and generalises the Habiro ring of a number field of Garoufalidis-Scholze-Wheeler-Zagier and is closely related to the $q$-de Rham--Witt complexes from previous work of the author as well as, conjecturally, to Scholze's analytic Habiro stack. While there's no canonical $q$-Hodge filtration in general, we show that it does exist in many cases of interest. For example, for a smooth scheme $X$ over $\mathbb Z$, the $q$-de Rham complex can be equipped with a canonical $q$-Hodge filtration as soon as one inverts all primes $p\leq \dim(X/\mathbb Z)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unfolding singular points in linear differential equations is a classical technique for studying the properties of irregular singularities by relating them to regular singularities. In this paper, we propose a general framework for unfolding unramified irregular singularities of meromorphic connections on the trivial principal $G$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. One of our main results is the description of the unfolding of singularities in terms of deformations of their moduli spaces. We show that every moduli space of irreducible meromorphic $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ can be deformed into a moduli space of irreducible Fuchsian $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. Furthermore, we study the unfolding of additive Deligne-Simpson problems, in which the unfolding of irregular singularities naturally generates a family of such problems. As an application of our main result, we prove that a Deligne-Simpson problem for $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities admits a solution if and only if every unfolded Deligne-Simpson problem in the family admits a simultaneous solution. We also provide a combinatorial and diagrammatic framework of the unfolding process in terms of spectral types and unfolding diagrams. Finally, we address a conjecture proposed by Oshima concerning the existence of irreducible $G$-connections that realize prescribed spectral types and their unfoldings. Our main result gives an affirmative answer to this conjecture.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages. v2:Appendix B added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a strong form of the cohomological integrality theorem, decomposing the cohomology of smooth symmetric stacks as the cohomological Hall induction of the intersection cohomology of the good moduli spaces of stacks of graded points. This generalizes the previous result by the second author together with Bu--Davison--Ib\'a\~nez Nu\~nez--P\u{a}durariu to non-orthogonal stacks, and confirms a conjecture of the first author that the algebraic BPS cohomology of the quotient stack of a symmetric representation matches the intersection cohomology group whenever it is nonzero. As a consequence, we obtain a version of the cohomological integrality theorem for general 0-shifted symplectic stacks with good moduli spaces, as well as for the character stacks of general compact oriented $3$-manifolds with reductive gauge groups. As an application, we prove Halpern-Leistner's conjecture on the purity of the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks admitting proper good moduli spaces. Our proof combines a cohomological bound for the algebraic BPS cohomology, due to the first author and based on Efimov's lemma, with a vanishing-cycle argument due to the second author in collaboration with Bu--Davison--Ib\'a\~nez Nu\~nez--P\u{a}durariu. We also give a purely geometric proof of the required cohomological bound.</p></details>

Assume that $E$ has potentially multiplicative reduction. We classify when all $G_{\mathbb{Q}_\ell}$-isomorphisms $\phi : E[p] \to E'[p]$ have the same symplectic type and prove two new criteria to determine the type in that case. In particular, when both curves have multiplicative reduction, our results cover the case of unramified $p$-torsion which is not covered by the original criterion due to Kraus and Oesterl\'e. We also give a variant of a symplectic criterion for the case when both $E$ and~$E'$ have good reduction and provide an algorithm to apply it. As an application, we determine the symplectic type of all the mod $p \geq 5$ congruences between rational elliptic curves with conductor $\leq 500 000$ that satisfy the hypothesis of either of our criteria at some prime~$\ell$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 87 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There is considerable current interest in applications of generalised Lie algebras graded by an abelian group $\Gamma$ with a commutative factor $\omega$. This calls for a systematic development of the theory of such algebraic structures. We treat the representation theory and invariant theory of the $\Gamma$-graded general linear Lie $\omega$-algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(V(\Gamma, \omega))$, where $V(\Gamma, \omega)$ is any finite dimensional $\Gamma$-graded vector space. Generalised Howe dualities over symmetric $(\Gamma, \omega)$-algebras are established, from which we derive the first and second fundamental theorems of invariant theory, and a generalised Schur-Weyl duality. The unitarisable $\mathfrak{gl}(V(\Gamma, \omega))$-modules for two ``compact'' $\ast$-structures are classified, and it is shown that the tensor powers of $V(\Gamma, \omega)$ and their duals are unitarisable for the two compact $\ast$-structures respectively. A Hopf $(\Gamma, \omega)$-algebra is constructed, which gives rise to a group functor corresponding to the general linear group in the $\Gamma$-graded setting. Using this Hopf $(\Gamma, \omega)$-algebra, we realise simple tensor modules and their dual modules by mimicking the classic Borel-Weil theorem. We also analyse in some detail the case with $\Gamma={\mathbb Z}^{\dim{V(\Gamma, \omega)}}$ and $\omega$ depending on a complex parameter $q\ne 0$, where $\mathfrak{gl}(V(\Gamma, \omega))$ shares common features with the quantum general linear (super)group, but is better behaved especially when $q$ is a root of unity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A Kronecker coefficient is the multiplicity of an irreducible representation of a finite group $G$ in a tensor product of irreducible representations. We define Kronecker Hecke algebras and use them as a tool to study Kronecker coefficients in finite groups. We show that the number of simultaneous conjugacy classes in a finite group $G$ is equal to the sum of squares of Kronecker coefficients, and the number of simultaneous conjugacy classes that are closed under elementwise inversion is the sum of Kronecker coefficients weighted by Frobenius-Schur indicators. We use these tools to investigate which finite groups have multiplicity-free tensor products. We introduce the class of doubly real groups, and show that they are precisely the real groups which have multiplicity-free tensor products. We show that non-Abelian groups of odd order, non-Abelian finite simple groups, and most finite general linear groups do not have multiplicity-free tensor products.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The main goal of this paper is to extend two fundamental combinatorial results in Schubert calculus on flag manifolds from equivariant cohomology and $K$-theory to equivariant elliptic cohomology. The foundations of elliptic Schubert calculus were laid in a few relatively recent papers by Rim\'anyi, Weber, and Kumar. They include the recursive construction of elliptic Schubert classes via generalizations of the cohomology and $K$-theory push-pull operators and the study of the corresponding Demazure algebra. We derive a Billey-type formula for the localization of elliptic Schubert classes (for partial flag manifolds of arbitrary type) and a pipe dream model for their polynomial representatives in the case of type $A$ flag manifolds. The latter extends the pipe dream model for double Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials. We also study the degeneration of elliptic Schubert classes to $K$-theory, which recovers the corresponding classical formulas.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The theory of factor-equivalence of integral lattices establishes a far-reaching relationship between the Galois module structure of the unit group of the ring of integers of a number field and its arithmetic. For a number field $K$ that is Galois over $\mathbb{Q}$ or an imaginary quadratic field, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition on the quotients of class numbers of subfields of $K$, for the quotient $E_{K}$ of the unit group of the ring of integers of $K$ modulo the subgroup of roots of unity to be factor equivalent to the standard cyclic Galois module. Using strong arithmetic properties of totally real $p$-rational number fields, we prove that the non-abelian $p$-rational $p$-extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ do not admit Minkowski units, thereby extending a result of Burns to non-abelian number fields. We also study the relative Galois module structure of $E_{L}$ for varying Galois extensions $L/F$ of totally real $p$-rational number fields whose Galois groups are isomorphic to a fixed finite group $G$. In that case, we prove that there exists a finite set $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{Z}_p[G]$-lattices such that for every $L$, $\mathbb{Z}_{p} \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} E_{L}$ is factor equivalent to $\mathbb{Z}_{p}[G]^{n} \oplus X$ as $\mathbb{Z}_p[G]$-lattices for some $X \in \Omega$ and an integer $n \geq 0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The cluster variety of triples of flags (associated with a split simple Lie group of Dynkin type Delta) plays a key role in higher Teichmuller theory as developed by Fock-Goncharov, Jiarui Fei, Ian Le, ... and Goncharov-Shen. We refer to it as the basic triangle associated with Delta. In this paper, for simply laced Delta, we construct and study a Higgs category (in the sense of Yilin Wu) which we expect to categorify the basic triangle. This category is a certain exact dg category (in the sense of Xiaofa Chen) which is Frobenius and stably 2-Calabi-Yau. We show that it has indeed the expected cyclic group symmetry and that its derived category has the expected braid group symmetry. A key ingredient in our construction is a conjecture by Merlin Christ, whose proof occupies most of this paper. The proof is based on a new description of the Higgs category in terms of Gorenstein projective dg modules. Our techniques are in the spirit of Orlov in his work on triangulated categories of graded B-branes.</p></details>

In that regard, our main results may be seen as an Euler system incarnation of the factorization formula of Bella\"iche and Dasgupta.

> **Comment:** This is our submission for the (ICM) Proceedings 2026

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we explore several threads arising from our recent joint work on arithmetic holonomy bounds, which were originally devised to prove new irrationality results based on the method of Ap\'ery limits. We propose a new method to address effective Diophantine approximation on the projective line and the multiplicative group. This method, and all our other results in the paper, emerged from quantifying our holonomy bounds in a way that directly yields effective measures of irrationality and linear independence. Applying these to a dihedral algebraic construction, we derive good effective irrationality measures for high order roots of an algebraic number, in an approach that might be considered a multivalent continuation of the classical hypergeometric method of Thue, Siegel, and Baker. A well-known Dirichlet approximation argument of Bombieri allows one to derive from this the classical effective Diophantine theorems, hitherto only approachable by Baker's linear forms in logarithms or by Bombieri's equivariant Thue--Siegel method. These include the algorithmic resolution of the two-variable $S$-unit equation, the Thue--Mahler equation, and the hyperelliptic and superelliptic equations, as well as the Baker--Feldman effective power sharpening of Liouville's theorem. We also give some other applications, including irrationality measures for the classical $L(2,\chi_{-3})$ and the $2$-adic $\zeta(5)$, and a new proof of the transcendence of $\pi$. Due to space limitations, a full development of these ideas will be deferred to future work.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This is a substantial rewrite, making all of the combinatorial algorithms more explicit, and filling a gap in the previous proof of the main theorem for the orthogonal group

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $H$ be a complex reductive group, with finite-dimensional representations $W$ and $U$. The module of covariants for $W$ of type $U$ is the space of all $H$-equivariant polynomial maps $\varphi: W \longrightarrow U$. In this paper, we take $H$ to be one of the classical groups $\mathrm{GL}(V)$, $\mathrm{O}(V)$, or $\mathrm{Sp}(V)$, where $W$ is a direct sum of copies of $V$ and $V^*$, and $U$ is an arbitrary rational representation (with $U$ restricted to exterior powers of $V$ in the $H= \mathrm{O}(V)$ case). Our main result gives uniform Stanley decompositions of these modules of covariants, with Stanley spaces parametrized by combinatorial objects we call jellyfish. As a corollary, we write down the Hilbert series as a finite sum of rational functions, each with a combinatorial interpretation in terms of lattice paths. Notably, these results do not rely on the module being Cohen-Macaulay. We further apply our methods to invariant rings for $\mathrm{SL}(V)$ and $\mathrm{SO}(V)$. Our proofs (for $H = \mathrm{GL}(V)$ and $\mathrm{Sp}(V)$) rely on previous work by Jackson on standard monomial theory for dual reductive pairs, since classical modules of covariants can be viewed via Howe duality as Harish-Chandra modules of unitary highest weight representations of a certain real reductive group. As a first step toward extending this program to arbitrary unitary highest weight representations (including those of the exceptional groups), we establish analogous results uniformly for the Wallach representations of type ADE.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any $0<c<1$ let $$ T_c(x)=|\big\{p\le x: p\in \mathbb{P}, P^+(p-1)\ge p^c\big\}|, $$ where $\mathbb{P}$ is the set of primes and $P^+(n)$ denotes the largest prime factor of $n$. Erd\H os proved in 1935 that $$ \limsup_{x\rightarrow \infty}T_c(x)/\pi(x)\rightarrow 0, \quad \text{as~}c\rightarrow 1, $$ where $\pi(x)$ denotes the number of primes not exceeding $x$. Recently, Ding gave a quantitative form of Erd\H os' result and showed that for $8/9< c<1$ we have $$ \limsup_{x\rightarrow \infty}T_c(x)/\pi(x)\le 8\big(c^{-1}-1\big). $$ In this article, Ding's bound is improved to $$ \limsup_{x\rightarrow \infty}T_c(x)/\pi(x)\le -\frac{7}{2}\log c $$ for $e^{-\frac{2}{7}}< c<1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Laurent phenomenon algebras, first introduced by Lam and Pylyavskyy, are a generalization of cluster algebras that still possess many salient features of cluster algebras. Graph Laurent phenomenon algebras, defined by Lam and Pylyavskyy, are a subclass of Laurent phenomenon algebras whose structure is given by the data of a directed graph. In this paper, we prove that the cluster monomials of a graph Laurent phenomenon algebra form a linear basis, as conjectured by Lam and Pylyavskyy and analogous to a result for cluster algebras by Caldero and Keller. We also prove that, if the graph is a bidirected tree, the coefficients of the expansion of any monomial in terms of cluster monomials are nonnegative.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Kleshchev and Livesey proved the existence of RoCK $p$-blocks for double covers of symmetric and alternating groups over large enough coefficient rings. They proved that RoCK blocks of double covers are Morita equivalent to standard ``local" blocks via bimodules with endopermutation source. Based on this, Kleshchev and Livesey proved that these RoCK blocks are splendidly Rickard equivalent to their Brauer correspondents. The analogous result for blocks of symmetric groups, a theorem of Chuang and Kessar, was an important step in Chuang and Rouquier ultimately proving Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for symmetric groups. In this paper we show that in most cases the Morita and splendid Rickard equivalences constructed by Kleshchev and Livesey descend to the ring $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p$-adic integers, hence prove Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for most of these RoCK blocks.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $V$ be a linear representation of a connected complex reductive group $G$. Given a choice of character $\theta$ of $G$, Geometric Invariant Theory defines a locus $V^{ss}_\theta(G) \subseteq V$ of semistable points. We give necessary, sufficient, and in some cases equivalent conditions for the existence of $\theta$ such that a maximal torus $T$ of $G$ acts on $V^{ss}_\theta(T)$ with finite stabilizers. In such cases, the stack quotient $[V^{ss}_\theta(G)/G]$ is is known to be Deligne-Mumford. Our proof uses the combinatorial structure of the weights of irreducible representations of semisimple groups. As an application we generalize the Grassmannian flop example of Donovan-Segal.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the modularity of mixed periods associated with singular fibers of specific families of Calabi-Yau threefolds. This is done by "fibering out", i.e. by expressing these periods as integrals of periods of families of K3 surfaces and by using modularity properties of the latter. Besides classical periods of holomorphic modular forms and meromorphic modular forms with vanishing residues, the computations lead to new interesting periods associated with meromorphic modular forms with non-vanishing residues as well as contours between CM points.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The center of a semisimple Lie algebra can be described as the algebra of W-invariant functions on the dual of the Cartan subalgebra. The centers of many Lie superalgebras have a similar description, but the defining equivalence relation on the dual of the Cartan subalgebra is not given by a finite group action. Lagrangian equivalence relations that we introduce generalize the action of a subgroup of the orthogonal group. Using them, we present a new proof of a result by Ian Musson about the centers of Lie superalgebras. Our proof is not based on a case-by-case analysis.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We find an intriguing relation between the chiral algebra and the mixed Hodge structure of the Coulomb branch of four dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 2$ superconformal field theories. We identify the space of irreducible characters of the $\mathcal{N} = 4$ $SU(N)$ chiral algebra $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$ by analytically computing the Wilson line Schur index, and imposing modular invariance. We further establish a map from the $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$ characters to the characters of the $\mathcal{T}_{p, N}$ chiral algebra. We extract the pure part of the mixed Hodge polynomial $PH_c$ of the Coulomb branch compactified on a circle, and prove that $PH_c$ encodes the representation theory of $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$. We expect this to be a new entry of the 4D mirror symmetry framework.</p></details>

Furthermore, if the primes $ p $ and $q$ are of the form $ 40k + 33 $ and $ 40l + 27$, where $k,l \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $(25k+ 5l +21)$ is a perfect square, then the given family of elliptic curves has rank one over $\mathbb{Q}$ and rank two over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$.

Furthermore, assuming the uniform boundedness of ranks of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$, the length $N$ satisfies a uniform upper bound independent of $E$.</p></details>
