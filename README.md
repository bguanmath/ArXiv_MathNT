<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we study admissible representations of even unitary groups over local fields, where the quadratic extension is ramified, with invariant vectors under the action of the stabilizer of a unimodular lattice and some properties of the corresponding integral model of unitary Shimura varieties. As a direct application, we are able to improve the arithmetic inner product formula so that the places with local root number \((-1)\) are allowed to be ramified.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hideaki Ishikawa, Takao Komatsu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we give explicit expressions about $q$-harmonic sums on $1-\cdots-1,A,1-\cdots-1$ indices. When $A=1$, many previous authors have studied and showed the identities, expressions, and properties. There are many results for explicit expressions about $q$-multiple zeta values or $q$-harmonic sums on $A-\cdots-A$ indices. Though there is the way to treat $q$-multiple zeta values unless the indices are the same, it has been successful to get the explicit expression of $q$-harmonic sums on $1-\cdots-1,A,1-\cdots-1$ indices when $A=2$. In this paper, we shall consider more general results when $A\ge 3$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Filippo Ambrosio, Giovanna Carnovale, Francesco Esposito, Neil Saunders, Lewis Topley &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Kato developed an exotic Deligne-Langlands correspondence using a geometric model for the multiparameter affine Hecke algebra of type C, based on his exotic nilpotent cone. Achar-Henderson and Springer showed that this exotic nilpotent is intimately related to another, apparently simpler variety called the enhanced nilpotent cone. Each of these is defined as the Hilbert nullcone of a polar module, the exotic Sp(2n)-module and the enhanced GL(n)-module, respectively. In this paper we conduct a detailed study of the geometry of these two modules, by introducing the Jordan stratification, simultaneously generalising classical results on the adjoint representation as well as the symmetric space associated to (gl(2n), sp(2n)). One of the key tools we develop is the theory of induced orbits in the enhanced and exotic nilpotent cones, following the work of Lusztig-Spaltenstein. Our main application is a classification of sheets in these modules, inspired by a theorem of Borho.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gerald Höhn, Sven Möller &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 42 pages, LaTeX; added a missing assumption in Proposition 2.2 and fixed a typo in Table 1

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a systematic, rigorous construction of all 70 strongly rational, holomorphic vertex operator algebras $V$ of central charge 24 with non-zero weight-one space $V_1$ as cyclic orbifold constructions associated with the 24 Niemeier lattice vertex operator algebras $V_N$ and certain 226 short automorphisms in $\mathrm{Aut}(V_N)$. We show that up to algebraic conjugacy these automorphisms are exactly the generalised deep holes, as introduced in arXiv:1910.04947, of the Niemeier lattice vertex operator algebras with the additional property that their orders are equal to those of the corresponding outer automorphisms. Together with the constructions in arXiv:1708.05990 and arXiv:1910.04947 this gives three different uniform constructions of these vertex operator algebras, which are related through 11 algebraic conjugacy classes in $\mathrm{Co}_0$. Finally, by considering the inverse orbifold constructions associated with the 226 short automorphisms, we give the first systematic proof of the result that each strongly rational, holomorphic vertex operator algebra $V$ of central charge 24 with non-zero weight-one space $V_1$ is uniquely determined by the Lie algebra structure of $V_1$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 75 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Starting from a single solution of QYBE (or CYBE) we produce an infinite family of solutions of QYBE (or CYBE) parametrized by transitive arrays and, in particular, by signed permutations. We are especially interested in cases when such solutions yield quasi-triangular structures on direct powers of Lie bialgebras and tensor powers of Hopf algebras. We obtain infinite families of such structures as well and study the corresponding Poisson-Lie structures and co-quasi-triangular algebras.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Fix broken reference, clarify some phrasing

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Prior work of Feng--Yun--Zhang established a (Higher) Arithmetic Hirzebruch Proportionality Principle, expressing the arithmetic volumes of moduli stacks of shtukas in terms of differential operators applied to $L$-functions. This formula involves certain "eigenweights" which were calculated in simple cases by Feng--Yun--Zhang, but not in general. We document work of a (custom) AI Agent built upon Gemini Deep Think, which employs tools from algebraic combinatorics to connect these eigenweights to the representation theory of symmetric groups, and then determines them for all classical groups.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02263v1'>2602.02263</a>\]&nbsp; **On the Spectral theory of Isogeny Graphs and Quantum Sampling of Hard Supersingular Elliptic curves**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** David Jao, Maher Mamah &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** quant-ph &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 24 pages with two figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study the problem of sampling random supersingular elliptic curves with unknown endomorphism rings. This task has recently attracted significant attention, as the secure instantiation of many isogeny-based cryptographic protocols relies on the ability to sample such ``hard'' curves. Existing approaches, however, achieve this only in a trusted-setup setting. We present the first provable quantum polynomial-time algorithm that samples a random hard supersingular elliptic curve with high probability.Our algorithm runs heuristically in $\tilde{O}\!\left(\log^{4}p\right)$ quantum gate complexity and in $\tilde{O}\!\left(\log^{13} p\right)$ under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. As a consequence, our algorithm gives a secure instantiation of the CGL hash function and other cryptographic primitives. Our analysis relies on a new spectral delocalization result for supersingular $\ell$-isogeny graphs: we prove the Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture, and we further provide numerical evidence for complete eigenvector delocalization; this theoretical result may be of independent interest. Along the way, we prove a stronger $\varepsilon$-separation property for eigenvalues of isogeny graphs than that predicted in the quantum money protocol of Kane, Sharif, and Silverberg, thereby removing a key heuristic assumption in their construction.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** John Cremona, Kalani Thalagoda, Dan Yasaki &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 31 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field and let $\mathcal{O}_K$ be its ring of integers. For an integral ideal $\mathfrak{n}$ of $\mathcal{O}_K$, let $Γ_0({\mathfrak{n}})$ be the congruence subgroup of level ${\mathfrak{n}}$ consisting of matrices in $\mathrm{GL}_2{\mathcal{O}_K}$ that are upper triangular mod ${\mathfrak{n}}$. In this paper, we discuss techniques to compute the space of Bianchi modular forms of level $Γ_0({\mathfrak{n}})$ as a Hecke module in the case where $K$ has arbitrary class group. Our algorithms and computations extend and complement those carried out for fields of class number $1$, $2$, and $3$ by the first author, and by his students Bygott and Lingham in unpublished theses. We give details and several examples for $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-17})$, whose class group is cyclic of order $4$, including a proof of modularity of an elliptic curve over this field. We also give an overview of the results obtained for a wide range of imaginary quadratic fields, which are tabulated in the L-functions and modular forms database (\href{https://www.lmfdb.org/}{LMFDB}).</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02242v1'>2602.02242</a>\]&nbsp; **New polar-finite forms of generalized Euler identities for $A_{1}^{(1)}$-string functions and mock theta conjecture-like identities**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Stepan Konenkov, Eric T. Mortenson &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 77 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Determining the explicit forms and modularity for string functions and branching coefficients for Kac--Moody algebras after Kac, Peterson, and Wakimoto is an important problem. For positive admissible-level string functions for the affine Kac--Moody algebra $A_{1}^{(1)}$, very little is known. Here we apply the notion of quasi-periodicity to a generalized Euler identity of Schilling and Warnaar for the affine Kac--Moody algebra $A_{1}^{(1)}$. For integral-level string functions the classical periodicity reduces the infinite sum of string functions in the generalized Euler identity to a finite sum of string functions with theta function coefficients. For admissible-level, we similarly reduce to an analogous finite sum of string functions, but we also gain an additional finite sum of the form \begin{equation*} \sum_{i}Φ_{i}(q)Ψ_{i}(q), \end{equation*} where the $Φ_i(q)$'s are modular and depend only on the spin and the $Ψ_{i}(q)$'s are (mixed) mock modular Hecke-type double-sums and depend only on the quantum number. For levels $1/2$, $1/3$, and $2/3$, we shall also see that the $Ψ_{i}(q)$'s give us families of mock theta conjecture-like identities for symmetric Hecke-type double-sums. Our work here focuses on evaluating the $Ψ_{i}(q)$'s, and our expressions utilize Ramanujan's second-order mock theta function $μ_2(q)$ and third-order mock theta functions $f_{3}(q)$, $ω_3(q)$, $ψ_{3}(q)$, and $χ_3(q)$.</p></details>

Le, Thang Luong &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** cs.AI &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Correct some typos and wordings

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a case study in semi-autonomous mathematics discovery, using Gemini to systematically evaluate 700 conjectures labeled 'Open' in Bloom's Erdős Problems database. We employ a hybrid methodology: AI-driven natural language verification to narrow the search space, followed by human expert evaluation to gauge correctness and novelty. We address 13 problems that were marked 'Open' in the database: 5 through seemingly novel autonomous solutions, and 8 through identification of previous solutions in the existing literature. Our findings suggest that the 'Open' status of the problems was through obscurity rather than difficulty. We also identify and discuss issues arising in applying AI to math conjectures at scale, highlighting the difficulty of literature identification and the risk of ''subconscious plagiarism'' by AI. We reflect on the takeaways from AI-assisted efforts on the Erdős Problems.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18599v4'>2601.18599</a>\]&nbsp; **Asymptotics of the d'Arcais Numbers at Small $k$**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Shannon Starr &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 15 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The d'Arcais numbers are the triangular array $\{A(2,n,k)\, :\, n=0,1,\dots,\, k=0,\dots,n\}$, such that $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{n} A(2,n,k) x^k z^n/n! = ((z;z)_{\infty})^{-x}$. The infinite $q$-Pochhammer symbol is $(q;q)_{\infty} = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1-q^n)$. Holding $k$ fixed and considering large $n$, we note that the ratio $k! A(2,n,k)/n!$ is asymptotic to $C(k) σ_{2k-1}(n)/n^k$ where the divisor sum function is $σ_p(n) = \sum_{d|n} d^p$ and $C(k) = (ζ(2))^k/(Γ(k) ζ(2k))$. This is a slightly generalized version of one of Ramanujan's formulas from his paper, ``On Certain Arithmetical Functions," and it is an immediate consequence of the more recent article of Oliver, Shreshta and Thorne. Heim and Neuhauser made a conjecture, that $A(2,n,k)/A(2,n,k-1)$ is greater than or equal to $A(2,n,k+1)/A(2,n,k)$, for $k=2,3,\dots$ and all $n$. The conjecture is false for $k=2$, and it is true for $k=3,4,\dots$ when $n$ is sufficiently large. We consider the Hardy-Ramanujan circle method as a heuristic step.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 38 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let G be a split reductive group over the integers, F a p-adic local field with residue field Fq. We relate the pro-p-Iwahori Hecke algebra H of G(F) over Fq to the Vinberg monoid of the dual group and study this relation. As an application, in the GL(n)-case and for F/Qp unramified, we derive a parametrization of SpecZ by semisimple n-dimensional representations of the absolute Galois group of F, generalizing the known case n = 2. Here Z denotes the center of H.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07103v2'>2601.07103</a>\]&nbsp; **Large Deviations for the d'Arcais Numbers**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Shannon Starr &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.PR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 23 pages, 4 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The d'Arcais polynomials $P_n(z)$ for $n\in\{0,1,\dots\}$ are defined as $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} P_n(z) q^n = \exp(-z\ln((q;q)_{\infty}))$ where the $q$-Pochhammer symbol is $(q;q)_{\infty} = \prod_{k=1}^{\infty} (1-q^k)$ for $|q|<1$. Denoting the coefficients for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by the formula $P_n(z) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A(2,n,k) z^k/n!$, we prove that $k_n! A(2,n,k_n)/n!$ satisfies a Bahadur-Rao type large deviation formula in the limit $n \to \infty$ with $k_n/n \to κ\in [0,1)$ as long as $k_n \to \infty$. The large deviation rate function is the Legendre-Fenchel transform $g^*(-κ)$ where $g(κ) = f^{-1}(κ)$ for the function $f : (0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $f(y)= \ln(-\ln((e^{-y};e^{-y})_{\infty}))$. We relate this fact to information about the abundancy index.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An irreducible representation of a reductive Lie algebra, when restricted to a Cartan subalgebra, decomposes into weights with multiplicity. The first part of this paper outlines a procedure to compute symmetric polynomials (e.g., power sums) of this multiset of weights, as functions of the highest weight. Next, let G be a connected reductive complex algebraic group with maximal torus T. We express the restrictions of the Chern classes of irreducible representations of G to T, as polynomial functions in the highest weight. We do the same for Stiefel-Whitney classes of orthogonal representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we construct a class of non-weight modules over the Takiff $\mathfrak{sl}_{2}$ by taking the tensor products of the irreducible free $U(\overline{\mathfrak{h}})$-modules of rank 1, where $\overline{\mathfrak{h}}$ is a natural Cartan subalgebra of the Takiff $\mathfrak{sl}_{2}$, with the irreducible highest weight modules. We characterize the irreducibility of these tensor product modules and determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for isomorphisms between them. We further prove that these non-weight modules are distinct from the known non-weight modules. Finally, we reformulate some tensor product modules over the Takiff $\mathfrak{sl}_{2}$ as induced modules derived from modules over certain subalgebras, and determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for the reducibility of these induced modules.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages, 1 figure. v2: expanded Theorem 3(1) and Conjecture 3.8

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define tensor categories ${\sf Ver}_{p^n}(G)$ in characteristic $p$ for connected reductive groups $G$ and positive integers $n$, generalising the semisimple Verlinde categories ${\sf Ver}_p(G)$ originating from Gelfand-Kazhdan and the higher Verlinde categories ${\sf Ver}_{p^n}$ for ${\rm SL}_2$ defined by Benson-Etingof-Ostrik. The construction is based on the definition of ${\sf Ver}_{p^n}$ as an abelian envelope of a quotient of a category of tilting modules, but we also introduce an expanded construction which refines the ${\rm SL}_2$ case and gives new results. In particular, the union ${\sf Ver}_{p^\infty}(G)$ can be derived from the perfection of $G$; certain exact sequences in ${\sf Rep}G$ map to exact sequences in ${\sf Ver}_{p^n}(G)$; and the underlying abelian category of ${\sf Ver}_{p^n}$ can be expressed as a subcategory of ${\sf Rep}{\rm SL}_2$, or as a Serre quotient of a subcategory of ${\sf Rep}{\rm SL}_2$.</p></details>

The computability of $β$ is unknown.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a perfect field with $\mathrm{char}(k)\neq 2,3$, set $K=k(t)$, and let $\mathcal{W}_n^{\min}$ be the moduli stack of minimal elliptic curves over $K$ of Faltings height $n$ from the height-moduli framework of Bejleri-Park-Satriano applied to $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1,1}\simeq \mathcal{P}(4,6)$. For $[E]\in \mathcal{W}_n^{\min}$, let $S \to \mathbb{P}^1_{k}$ be the associated elliptic surface with section. Motivated by the Shioda-Tate formula, we consider the trivariate motivic height zeta function $$ \mathcal{Z}(u,v;t):= \sum_{n\ge0}\Bigl(\sum_{[E]\in \mathcal{W}_n^{\min}} u^{T(S)}v^{\mathrm{rk}(E/K)}\Bigr)t^n \in K_0(\mathrm{Stck}_k)[u,v][[t]] $$ which refines the height series by weighting each height stratum with the trivial lattice rank $T(S)$ and the Mordell--Weil rank $\mathrm{rk}(E/K)$. We prove rationality for the trivial lattice specialization $Z_{\mathrm{Triv}}(u;t)=\mathcal{Z}(u,1;t)$ by giving an explicit finite Euler product. We conjecture irrationality for the Néron-Severi $Z_{\mathrm{NS}}(w;t)=\mathcal{Z}(w,w;t)$ and the Mordell-Weil $Z_{\mathrm{MW}}(v;t)=\mathcal{Z}(1,v;t)$ specializations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we examine the restriction of the metaplectic representation $π$ over a $p$-adic field $k$, $p\neq2$, of zero characteristic to an isotropic torus $S$ contained in the symplectic group. First we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the momentum map in order that $S$ be admissible, that is $π_{\vert S}$ decomposes with finite multiplicities. Let us say that a torus contained in the symplectic group is irreducible if its action on the symplectic space is irreducible over $k$. Then we examine the case when $S$ is a proper subtorus of a maximal irreducible torus $T$ in the symplectic group and give sufficient conditions on $T$ in order that $S$ never be admissible. When these conditions are not satisfied, we give examples of admissible proper tori of a maximal irreducible torus. Finally, for any admissible subtorus $S$ of a certain type of maximal irreducible torus, we compute the multiplicity of the unitary characters of $S$ appearing into $π_{\vert S}$. We also show that the multiplicity of such a character is equal to the volume of the symplectic reduction of the inverse image under the momentum map of a linear form associated to it.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Representation theory of Lie (super)algebras has attracted significant research interest for many years, especially due to its applications in theoretical physics; in this regard, the representation theory of affine Lie (super)algebras is of central importance. To characterize simple modules over affine Lie (super)algebras, it is necessary to study the cases of nonzero and critical levels separately. Although a vast amount of research has been done on the representation theory of affine Lie (super)algebras $\mathcal{L}$, investigations concerning general modules at the critical level remain limited. In all existing studies, the characterization of the modules under consideration is reduced to the characterization of modules over some subalgebras of $\mathcal{L}$. Depending on the structure of the original modules, these subalgebras -- and the corresponding modules -- have different natures some of which are already known, while others need to be studied separately. In this paper, we give a complete characterization of the modules over specific subalgebras $\mathcal{G}$ of a twisted affine Lie superalgebra $\mathcal{L}$ that arise in the study of general zero level simple finite weight $\mathcal{L}$-modules. In particular, in the special case that $\\mathcal{G} = \mathcal{L}$, we obtain a complete characterization of quasi-integrable $\mathcal{L}$-modules of level zero.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate a new family of cyclic septic fields $\{K_t\}_{t\in\mathbb{Z}}$ arising from the Hashimoto--Hoshi construction. For this family, we compute the discriminant explicitly and characterize their Pólya property under the condition that the polynomial $E(t) = t^{6} + 2t^{5} + 11t^{4} + t^{3} + 16t^{2} + 4t + 8$ takes fifth-power free values. We show that this family contains infinitely many non-Pólya fields for which the cardinality of the Pólya group is unbounded. We also establish that, assuming Bunyakovsky's conjecture for $E(t)$, this family contains infinitely many Pólya fields. We further show that, for any fixed positive integer $m$, there exist infinitely many blocks of $m$ consecutive fields in this family whose cardinality of the Pólya groups can be made arbitrarily large. Finally, we demonstrate that infinitely many fields in this family are non-monogenic with field index one.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a single explicit entire function $Ξ_c(s)$ of order 1, with all zeros provably on $Re(s) = 1/2$, satisfying a functional equation $Ξ_c(s) = Ξ_c(1-s)$, whose normalized form $Z_c(s) = Ξ_c(s)/[\tfrac{1}{2}s(s-1)π^{-s/2}Γ(s/2)]$ is uniformly bounded for $Re(s) > 1 + δ$ yet satisfies $\sup_t|Z_c(1+it)| = +\infty$. The function thus satisfies an analogue of the Riemann Hypothesis together with the sharp bounded/unbounded transition at $σ= 1$ characteristic of $ζ$. The transition is controlled by a Dirichlet series $D(s) = \sum e^{-ikθ} p_k^{-s}$ whose absolute convergence for $σ> 1$ and divergence at $σ= 1$ drive the dichotomy. The key technical input is a dyadic large-sieve estimate establishing the linearization condition that connects the Hadamard product to $D$. The construction and proofs were developed in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic); see Acknowledgments.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish an explicit formula for the type number of quaternion orders of level $(N_1, N_2)$, where $N_1 = p_1^{2u_1+1} \cdots p_w^{2u_w+1}$ (with $u_i \geq 0$ and $w$ odd) and $\gcd(N_1, N_2) = 1$. Our main result generalizes Pizer's work on Eichler orders (where $N_1$ is squarefree) and Boyd's formula (where $N_1 = p^{2u+1}$) to the general case with arbitrary prime powers in $N_1$. The proof introduces a generalization of the modified Hurwitz class number $H^{(N_1,N_2)}(D)$, originally defined by Li, Skoruppa and the second author for squarefree levels. Through a bijection between quaternion orders and ternary quadratic forms, we express the type number as a weighted sum of representation numbers, which we evaluate explicitly via the Siegel-Weil formula and local density computations. We compute type numbers for all levels with $N_1 N_2 \leq 100$ and correct four entries in Boyd's 1994 table. As a further application, we classify all 27 pairs $(N_1, N_2)$ having type number $1$, extending the list of 9 squarefree pairs found by Boylan, Skoruppa and the second author.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A key property of an algebraic variety is whether it is absolutely irreducible, meaning that it remains irreducible over the algebraic closure of its defining field, and determining absolute irreducibility is important in algebraic geometry and its applications in coding theory, cryptography, and other fields. Among the applications of absolute irreducibility are bounding the number of rational points via the Weil conjectures and establishing exceptional APN and permutation properties of functions over finite fields. In this article, we present a new criterion for the absolute irreducibility of hypersurfaces defined by multivariate polynomials over finite fields. Our criterion does not require testing for irreducibility in the ground or extension fields, assuming that the leading form is square-free. We just require multivariate GCD computations and the square-free property. Since almost all polynomials are known to be square-free, our absolute irreducibility criterion is valid for almost all multivariate polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish functional Loomis--Whitney type inequalities in the finite Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n(\mathbb{F}_q)$. For $n=1$, we determine the sharp region of exponents $(u_1,u_2)$ for which the Heisenberg Loomis--Whitney inequality $$ \frac{1}{q^3}\sum_{(x,t)\in \mathbb{H}^1(\mathbb{F}_q)} f_1(π_1(x,t))\,f_2(π_2(x,t)) \;\lesssim\; \|f_1\|_{L^{u_1}(\mathbb{F}_q^2,dx)}\|f_2\|_{L^{u_2}(\mathbb{F}_q^2,dx)} $$ holds uniformly in $q$, namely $$ \frac{1}{u_1}+\frac{2}{u_2}\le 2 \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{2}{u_1}+\frac{1}{u_2}\le 2, $$ which includes the endpoint estimate $L^{\frac{3}{2}}\times L^{\frac{3}{2}}\to L^1$. For general $n$, we prove the symmetric multilinear estimate at the endpoint exponent $ u=\frac{n(2n+1)}{n+1}, $ using an induction on $n$ that exploits the Heisenberg fiber structure together with a multilinear interpolation scheme. Specializing to indicator functions yields a sharp Loomis--Whitney type set inequality bounding $|K|$ for every finite $K\subset \mathbb{H}^n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ in terms of the sizes of its $2n$ Heisenberg projections $\{π_j(K)\}_{j=1}^{2n}$, and in particular, $$ \max_{1\le j\le 2n} |π_j(K)| \;\gtrsim_n\; |K|^{\frac{2n+1}{2(n+1)}}\,q^{-\frac{1}{2(n+1)}}. $$ This result is optimal up to absolute constants. Moreover, when $n=1$ and $|K|>q$, we obtain a stronger statement via Vinh's point--line incidence theorem. We also discuss connections to a boundedness problem for multilinear forms/operators over finite fields studied by Bhowmik, Iosevich, Koh, and Pham (2025), and to orthogonal projection/covering questions in $\mathbb{F}_q^{2n+1}$ studied by Chen (2018).</p></details>

I count the number of level-raising modular forms $g$ of weight $2$ that are congruent to $f$ modulo $p$, with level $N_g\leq X$, such that the $p$-rank of the Selmer groups of $g$ equals that of $f$. Under some mild assumptions on $\barρ$, I prove that this count grows at least as fast as $X (\log X)^{α- 1}$ as $X \to \infty$, for an explicit constant $α> 0$. The main result is a partial generalization of theorems of Ono and Skinner on rank-zero quadratic twists to the setting of modular forms and Selmer groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K\subset\mathbb R^d$ be a compact subset equipped with a $δ$-Ahlfors regular measure $μ$. For any $τ>1/d$ and any ``inhomogeneous'' vector $\boldsymbolθ\in\mathbb R^d$, let $W_d(ψ_τ,\boldsymbolθ)$ denote the set of $(ψ_τ,\boldsymbolθ)$-well approximable numbers, where $ψ_τ(q)=q^{-τ}$. Assuming a local estimate for the $μ$-measure of the intersections of $K$ with the neighborhoods of ``rational'' vectors $(\mathbf p+\boldsymbolθ)/q$, we establish a sharp upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of $K\cap W_d(ψ_τ,\boldsymbolθ)$, together with some nontrivial lower bounds when $τ$ is below a certain threshold. One of the lower bounds becomes sharp in the one-dimensional homogeneous case ($d=1$, $θ=0$) for a class of sufficiently thick self-similar sets $K$, and moreover $K\cap W_1(ψ_τ,0)$ has full $(δ+\frac{2}{1+τ}-1)$-Hausdorff measure. These results have several applications: (1) the set of homogeneous very well approximable numbers has full Hausdorff dimension within strongly irreducible self-similar sets in $\mathbb R^d$, extending a recent result of Chen [arXiv:2510.17096]; (2) the set of inhomogeneous very well approximable numbers has full Hausdorff dimension within sufficiently thick missing digits sets in $\mathbb R$, affirmatively answering a question posed by Yu [arXiv:2101.05910]. Our applications build on the seminal works of Yu [arXiv:2101.05910] and Bénard, He and Zhang [arXiv:2508.09076].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is a first stab at a mathematical framework in which one can study quantum field theories on spacetimes with quite general geometries. We will study these theories via their factorization algebras. The aim is to identify a minimalist formalism that makes sense of factorization algebras in any geometric context. This formalism extends the technology of factorization algebras to many new contexts, including those arising in arithmetic quantum field theories. In order to make sense of factorization algebras on a geometric object X, one needs two ingredients. First, one needs an additional piece of structure on X that we call an "isolability structure." This is the data required to say whether two (generalized) points of X are "distant." This is encoded as a functor from a certain combinatorial category of cographs. Second, one needs some sort of sheaf theory. The isolability structure then induces on the category of sheaves a kind of twofold symmetric monoidal structure. Factorization algebras are then defined in terms of this structure. This paper develops this formalism. We describe how some existing theories of factorization algebras fit into this framework, and we give a construction of the Beilinson-Drinfeld Grassmannian as a factorization stack that works in quite a lot of generality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct left and right Calabi-Yau structures on derived respectively singularity categories of symmetric orders $Λ$ over commutative Gorenstein rings $R$. For this, we first construct Calabi-Yau structures over $R$ by lifting Amiot's construction of Calabi-Yau structures on Verdier quotients to the dg level. Then we prove base change properties relating Calabi-Yau structures over $R$ to those over the base field $k$. As a result, we prove the existence of a right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category associated with $Λ$ which is a cyclic lift of the weak Calabi-Yau structure constructed by the first-named author and Iyama. We also show the existence of a left Calabi-Yau structure on the dg bounded derived category of $Λ$. This is a non-commutative generalization of a result by Brav and Dyckerhoff. By combining the existence of the right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category with a structure theorem by Keller and the second-named author, we deduce that under suitable hypotheses, the singularity category associated with $Λ$ is triangle equivalent to a generalized cluster category in the sense of Amiot.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $C$ be a smooth plane quartic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$. Costa, Harvey and Sutherland provide an algorithm with an implementation, improving Harvey's average polynomial-time algorithm, to compute the $\bmod \ p$ reduction of the numerator of the zeta function of $C$ at all $p\leq B$, where $p$ is an odd prime of good reduction, in $O(B\log^{3+o(1)} N)$ time, which is $O(\log^{4+o(1)}p)$ time on average per prime. Alternatively, their algorithm can do this for a single prime $p$ of good reduction in $O(p^{1/2}\log^2p)$ time. While this algorithm can be used to compute the full zeta function, no implementation of this step currently exists. In this article, we provide an algorithm and an implementation for the group operation on the Jacobian of $C$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$, where $p$ is an odd prime of good reduction. We provide a Las Vegas algorithm that takes the $\bmod \ p$ result of Costa, Harvey and Sutherland's algorithm and uses it to compute the full zeta function. The expected running time of the algorithm is bounded by $O(p^{1/2+o(1)})$, and under heuristic assumptions, we prove an $O(p^{1/4+o(1)})$ bound on its average running time (over all inputs). Our lifting algorithm can also be applied to hyperelliptic curves of genus 3.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study fast Monte-Carlo methods for testing irreducibility and detecting arithmetic imprimitivity of polynomials over $\mathbb{Q}$. Building on the subset-sum criterion of Pemantle-Peres-Rivin, we develop a probabilistic irreducibility test whose expected running time, measured in the number of primes examined, is logarithmic in the degree for generic inputs. Unlike the standard modular irreducibility test, the method aggregates information from modular factorizations rather than discarding unsuccessful trials. We show that failure of this test, when combined with a standard modular irreducibility certificate, is a strong indicator of non-generic algebraic structure. In particular, it often signals arithmetic imprimitivity of the Galois action. We present an explicit and efficient Monte-Carlo algorithm for detecting such imprimitivity via subfield extraction, yielding constructive algebraic certificates in the imprimitive case. To our knowledge, this is the first practical algorithm for detecting arithmetic imprimitivity of polynomials over $\mathbb{Q}$ in high degree. We further show that the subset-sum data produced by the Pemantle--Peres--Rivin test provides a warm start for polynomial factorization by sharply restricting the possible degrees of rational factors, significantly accelerating subsequent lifting procedures. The proposed methods are orders of magnitude faster in practice than known deterministic algorithms, and are effective in degrees far beyond the reach of current deterministic techniques.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The monograph develops a self-contained, mathematically rigorous framework for massless representations of the conformal group U(2,2) and their restriction to the de Sitter group Sp(2,2). It systematically constructs ladder (massless) representations, computes invariant bilinear forms and Casimir operators, and provides explicit constructions of vertex operators and two-point functions for low-helicity fields. The monograph employs a novel Clifford-split-octonion approach, embedding 8-component Majorana spinors within an alternative composition algebra, which allows for fully explicit algebraic, spinorial, and geometric constructions. The text bridges foundational representation theory, explicit computational methods, and physical applications in quantum field theory and cosmology. While targeted at researchers in mathematical physics, quantum cosmology, and quantum field theory, the exposition is pedagogically structured to guide advanced graduate students through subtle algebraic and representation-theoretic ideas, making complex constructions accessible without sacrificing rigor.</p></details>

We say that $f(x)$ is {\em monogenic} if $f(x)$ is irreducible over ${\mathbb Q}$ and $\{1,θ,θ^2,θ^3,θ^4,θ^{5}\}$ is a basis for the ring of integers of ${\mathbb Q}(θ)$, where $f(θ)=0$. For each value of $k$ and each possible Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$ over ${\mathbb Q}$, we use a theorem of Jakhar, Khanduja and Sangwan to give explicit descriptions of all monogenic trinomials $f(x)$ having Galois group $G$. We also determine when these descriptions provide infinitely many such trinomials, and we investigate when these trinomials generate distinct sextic fields. These results extend recent work on monogenic power-compositional sextic trinomials of the form $g(x^3)$ to the situation $g(x^2)$, and thereby complete the characterization, in terms of their Galois groups, of monogenic power-compositional sextic trinomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any persistence module $M$ over a finite poset $\mathbf{P}$, and any interval $I$ of $\mathbf{P}$, we give a formula of the multiplicity $d_M(V_I)$ of the interval module $V_I$ in the indecomposable decomposition of $M$ in terms of the ranks of matrices consisting of structure linear maps of the module $M$, which gives a generalization of the corresponding formula for 1-dimensional persistence modules. As an easy application, the formula enables us to compute the maximal interval-decomposable direct summand of $M$, which gives us a way to decide whether $M$ is interval-decomposable or not. In addition, when a set $V_{I_1}, \dots, V_{I_n}$ of interval direct summands of $M$ gives a specific property of $M$, we can study this property by directly computing the multiplicities $d_M(V_{I_i})$ by our formula without decomposing $M$. Moreover, the formula tells us which morphisms of $\mathbf{P}$ are essential to compute the multiplicity $d_M(V_I)$. This suggests us some order-preserving map $ζ\colon Z \to \mathbf{P}$ such that the induced restriction functor $R \colon \mathrm{mod} \mathbf{P} \to \mathrm{mod} Z$ has the property that the multiplicity $d:= d_{R(M)}(R(V_I))$ is equal to $d_M(V_I)$. In this case, we say that $ζ$ essentially covers $I$. If $Z$ can be taken as a poset of Dynkin type $\mathbb{A}$, also known as a zigzag poset, then the calculation of the multiplicity $d$ can be done more efficiently, starting from the filtration level of topological spaces. Thus this even makes it unnecessary to compute the structure linear maps of $M$. Finally, we also give a formula of $d_M(V_I)$ in terms of a projective presentation of $M$ rather than its structure linear maps. In the 2D-grid case, this formula is more practical because in that case projective resolutions of $M$ can be computed from the filtration level of topological spaces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>These are lecture notes for an introductory course on Nichols algebras. As a main reference, I work with the book by Heckenberger and Schneider, but I want to take a distinct categorical perspective and try to develop the topic for an audience without a background in Hopf algebras. On the other hand I put some emphasis on hands-on examples. My first goal is to explain the definitions and the striking properties of Nichols algebras, foremost the odd reflection theory that is already present in Lie superalgebras. My second goal is to explain how the category of representations of a quantum group can be constructed, using categorical tools, from the Nichols algebra as its centerpiece. This makes the zoo of different existing versions of quantum groups more transparent and allows the construction of many more non-semisimple modular tensor categories. Other topics include different types of examples beyond the diagonal case, categorical versions of some Hopf algebra constructions, and an outlook section on the appearance of Nichols algebras in conformal field theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we relate two recent constructions that generalize classical (genus-zero) polylogarithms to higher-genus Riemann surfaces. A flat connection valued in a freely generated Lie algebra on a punctured Riemann surface of arbitrary genus produces an infinite family of homotopy-invariant iterated integrals associated to all possible words in the alphabet of the Lie algebra generators. Each iterated integral associated to a word is a higher-genus polylogarithm. Different flat connections taking values in the same Lie algebra on a given Riemann surface may be related to one another by the composition of a gauge transformation and an automorphism of the Lie algebra, thus producing closely related families of polylogarithms. In this paper we provide two methods to explicitly construct this correspondence between the meromorphic multiple-valued connection introduced by Enriquez in e-Print 1112.0864 and the non-meromorphic single-valued and modular-invariant connection introduced by D'Hoker, Hidding and Schlotterer, in e-Print 2306.08644.</p></details>

In this paper, we consider two weight $2k$ cusp forms $f^{\pm}_{k,N,D,ρ}$ on $Γ_0(N)$ defined by sums over binary quadratic forms, and investigate the vector-valued period polynomial arising from these forms. Our first main result gives a closed formula for this vector-valued period polynomial. The identity component of this formula is particularly explicit: it separates as the sum of a finite \textit{algebraic part} coming from some binary forms and a \textit{zeta part} involving the values at $s=k$ of certain zeta functions. Using this formula together with a symmetry of vector-valued period polynomials, we explicitly evaluate, for odd $k$, the difference between the zeta values corresponding to the two choices of square root of $D$ modulo $4N$, in terms of Bernoulli numbers and a finite quadratic-form sum. Finally, under a vanishing condition on Fricke-invariant cusp forms at lower levels, we obtain a finite divisor-sum formula for the Dedekind zeta values $ζ_{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})}(k)$ at even integers $k$.</p></details>

We further establish a Schlomilch-type formula, which provides an explicit connection between the two kinds of Stirling numbers. Using this formula, we derive another expression for the associated logarithm in terms of the Stirling numbers of the second kind associated with a delta series f (t). Finally, we provide fifteen concrete examples to illustrate the versatility of this framework, demonstrating how it unifies and extends several known results in combinatorial analysis.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages, restructured presentation with larger emphasis on topological results which have been expanded

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study a new topological notion of the size for subsets of the real line, called \emph{super-density}. A set $A\subset\mathbb{R}$ is super-dense if for every non-empty open interval $I$ and every nowhere constant continuous function $\varphi\colon I\to\mathbb{R}$, we have $\varphi(I\cap A)\cap A\neq\emptyset$. We first establish basic properties of super-dense sets. Our main topological result characterizes them within the framework of Baire category: a set with the Baire property is super-dense if and only if it is co-meager. We then investigate the implications for the theory of normal numbers. We prove that the set of non-normal numbers is super-dense, whereas the set of normal numbers is not. Consequently, no nowhere constant continuous function can map all non-normal numbers to normal numbers. Conversely, we explicitly construct a computable nowhere constant continuous function that maps all normal numbers to non-normal numbers. Finally, we provide a constructive algorithm that, given any countable family of nowhere constant continuous functions, produces a real number $x$ such that $x$ and all its images under these functions are non-normal. As a corollary, we obtain the existence of a non-normal number $x$ such that $e^{αx}$ is non-normal for every non-zero algebraic $α$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a complex reductive group $G$, we consider the locus $M^d$ in the moduli stack of $G$-Higgs bundles on which the centraliser dimension of the Higgs field takes a constant value $d> rk(G)$. We describe a non-abelian structure for the Hitchin fibration on $M^d$, under mild conditions on the geometry of the centraliser level set $\mathfrak{g}_d$ in the Lie algebra. If $G$ is a classical group, we also show that the restriction of the Hitchin map to the locus of generically semisimple Higgs bundles in $M^d$ factors through an abelian fibration. The abelianised fibres can be described using a generalisation of the cameral data of Donagi and Gaitsgory. We apply these constructions to $G_\mathbb{R}$-Hitchin fibrations for real forms $G_\mathbb{R}$. In particular we give a cameral description for an abelianisation of the $G_\mathbb{R}$-Hitchin fibration, which extends the known description in the quasi-split case. We determine this explicitly in the examples $G_\mathbb{R} = SU(p,q)$ and $G_{\mathbb{R}} = SO^*(4m+2)$. Our local results also give a connection between the geometry of the Hitchin fibration on $M^d$ and the representation theory of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, via the orbit method. As a corollary, we determine an explicit asymptotic relationship between two notions of multiplicity, one attached to an adjoint orbit in $\mathfrak{g}$ and one attached to a primitive ideal of the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak{g}$.</p></details>

As an illustrative application, we establish exact formulas for the expected number of rational orthogonal matrices that preserve the integrality of a random matrix for every fixed denominator in dimensions two and three. Notably, the dependence on the denominator turns out to be non-monotone due to number-theoretic fluctuations.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There are several recent works where authors have shown that number fields $K$ with `sufficiently many' units and cyclic class group contain a Euclidean ideal class provided the Hilbert class field $H(K)$ is absolutely abelian. In this article, we explore the latter hypothesis: how often a number field $K$ has absolutely abelian Hilbert class field? For a number field $K$ to have absolutely abelian Hilbert class field, we obtain several criteria in terms of class number of $K$, Pólya group of $K$, and genus number of $K$. We also show that for such number fields the $\ell-$torsion conjecture is true. Along with these, the article also reports some results on a theme to study class groups, developed by the authors, where primes of higher degree are used to study class groups.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jérémy Champagne, Zhenchao Ge, Thái Hoàng Lê, Yu-Ru Liu, Trevor D. Wooley &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** E. Ackelsberg and V. Bergelson have advised that the 'implied infelicity' noted in section 1 of our paper is remedied by correcting the conclusion of [2, Theorem 0.3] concerning well-distribution of g from an "if and only if" to an "if" statement; the ensuing conclusions claimed by Ackelsberg then follow without impairment. We intend to revise our paper to account for this forthcoming correction

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb F_q$ be the finite field of $q$ elements having characteristic $p$, and denote by $\mathbb K_\infty=\mathbb F_q((1/t))$ the field of formal Laurent series in $1/t$. We consider the equidistribution in $\mathbb T=\mathbb K_\infty/\mathbb F_q[t]$ of the values of polynomials $f(u)\in \mathbb K_\infty [u]$ as $u$ varies over $\mathbb F_q[t]$. Let $\mathcal K$ be a finite set of positive integers, and suppose that $α_r\in \mathbb K_\infty$ for $r\in \mathcal K\cup \{0\}$. We show that the polynomial $\sum_{r\in \mathcal K\cup\{0\}}α_ru^r$ is equidistributed in $\mathbb T$ whenever $α_k$ is irrational for some $k\in \mathcal K$ satisfying $p\nmid k$, and also $p^vk\not\in \mathcal K$ for any positive integer $v$. This conclusion resolves in full a conjecture made jointly by the third, fourth and fifth authors.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish that every set of $k=10$ natural numbers determines at least $30$ distinct pairwise sums or at least $30$ distinct pairwise products, as well as the analogous result for $k=11$ and at least $34$ sums/products, with sharpness exhibited by $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18\}$ and $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24\}$, respectively. This extends previous work of the fifth author with Clevenger, Havard, Heard, Lott, and Wilson, which established the corresponding thresholds for $k\leq 9$. Included is a classification result for sets of $10$ real numbers (resp. positive real numbers) determining at most $29$ pairwise sums (resp. pairwise products) that do not contain $8$ elements of any single arithmetic progression (resp. geometric progression), as well as some observations controlling additive quadruples in small subsets of two-dimensional generalized geometric progressions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Gelfand-Kazhdan criterion is a fundamental tool for studying multiplicity-one properties of local periods of representations. However, it does not apply to many cases arising in the relative Langlands program. Generalizing the usual Gelfand-Kazhdan criterion, we formulate and prove a vector-valued Gelfand-Kazhdan criterion that fits into the general framework of the relative Langlands program. As an illustration of its effectiveness, we establish the multiplicity-one property for the local Asai Rankin-Selberg periods.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present series converging to the Riemann zeta function in its half-plane of convergence, and possessing remainders whose sizes decrease geometrically. They are easy to implement numerically, using only polynomial and power functions, and are efficient for obtaining dozens or hundreds of digits (when the imaginary part is not too large). They may prove less suited to very high precision (tens of thousands of digits), due to a linear cost for each new term. One can express the coefficients as linear combinations of Bernoulli numbers, but this is not advantageous numerically. The method is a development of tools introduced by the author for the evaluation of harmonic series with restricted digits in a given radix.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show how various constructions of $\mathbb{Z}$-graded Lie superalgebras are related to each other. These Lie superalgebras have a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ as the subalgebra at degree 0, an odd $\mathfrak{g}$-module V as the subspace at degree 1, and an embedding tensor as an element at degree -1. This is a linear map from V to $\mathfrak{g}$ satisfying a quadratic constraint, which equips V with the structure of a Leibniz algebra.</p></details>
