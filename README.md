### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27603v1'>2510.27603</a>\]&nbsp; **The Skolem Problem in rings of positive characteristic**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-31 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ruiwen Dong, Doron Shafrir &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** cs.LO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 14 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the Skolem Problem is decidable in finitely generated commutative rings of positive characteristic. More precisely, we show that there exists an algorithm which, given a finite presentation of a (unitary) commutative ring $\mathcal{R} = \mathbb{Z}_{/T}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]/I$ of characteristic $T > 0$, and a linear recurrence sequence $(\gamma_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in \mathcal{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$, determines whether $(\gamma_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ contains a zero term. Our proof is based on two recent results: Dong and Shafrir (2025) on the solution set of S-unit equations over $p^e$-torsion modules, and Karimov, Luca, Nieuwveld, Ouaknine, and Worrell (2025) on solving linear equations over powers of two multiplicatively independent numbers. Our result implies, moreover, that the zero set of a linear recurrence sequence over a ring of characteristic $T = p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is effectively a finite union of $p_i$-normal sets in the sense of Derksen (2007).</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-31 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Leonidas Daskalakis &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DS &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 47 pages, no figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a pointwise convergence result for ergodic averages modeled along orbits of the form $(n\lfloor n\sqrt{k}\rfloor)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, where $k$ is an arbitrary positive rational number with $\sqrt{k}\not\in\mathbb{Q}$. Namely, we prove that for every such $k$, every measure-preserving system $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu,T)$ and every $f\in L^{\infty}_{\mu}(X)$, we have that $$ \lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^Nf(T^{n\lfloor n\sqrt{k}\rfloor}x)\quad\text{exists for $\mu$-a.e. $x\in X$.} $$ Notably, our analysis involves a curious implementation of the circle method developed for analyzing exponential sums with phases $(\xi n \lfloor n\sqrt{k}\rfloor)_{1\le n\le N}$ exhibiting arithmetical obstructions beyond rationals with small denominators, and is based on the Green and Tao's result on the quantitative behaviour of polynomial orbits on nilmanifolds. For the case $k=2$ such a circle method was firstly employed for addressing the corresponding Waring-type problem by Neale, and their work constitutes the departure point of our considerations.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-31 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Steve Fan, Andrew Lott &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 38 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix a positive prime power $q$, and let $\mathbb{F}_q[t]$ be the ring of polynomials over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. Suppose $A \subseteq \{f \in \mathbb{F}_q[t]\colon\text{deg}~ f \le N\}$ contains no pair of elements whose difference is of the form $P-1$ with $P$ irreducible. Adapting Green's approach to S\'ark\"ozy's theorem for shifted primes in $\mathbb{Z}$ using the van der Corput property, we show that $$|A| \ll q^{(N+1)(11/12+o(1))},$$ improving upon the bound $O\big(q^{(1-c/\log N)(N+1)}\big)$ due to L\^{e} and Spencer.</p></details>

We prove an analogous unconditional result for $\mathbf{F}_2[x]$, improving the exponent to $\frac{7}{8}+\epsilon$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the $\lambda$-invariants of Mazur--Tate elements of elliptic curves defined over the field of rational numbers at primes of additive reduction. We explain their growth and how these invariants relate to other better understood invariants depending on the potential reduction type. We give examples and a conjecture for the additive potentially supersingular case, supported by computational data from Sage in this setting. Further, we extend our results to $\lambda$-invariants of Mazur--Tate elements of cuspidal Hecke eigenforms associated with potentially ordinary $p$-adic Galois representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We initiate the mathematical study of the boundary Carrollian conformal algebra (BCCA), an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra recently discovered in the context of Carrollian physics. The BCCA is an intriguing object from both physical and mathematical perspectives, since it is a filtered but not graded Lie algebra. In this paper, we first construct some modules for the BCCA and one of its subalgebras, which we call $\mathcal{O}$, by restriction of well-known modules of the BMS$_3$ and Witt algebras respectively. Along the way, we prove the irreducibility criteria for the so-called ``induced modules'' of the BMS$_3$ algebra (which we prefer to call massive modules to avoid ambiguity) and show that this is the same criteria for the irreducibility of the Verma modules of the BMS$_3$ algebra. Interestingly, the modules generated by the action of the BCCA on the generating vector of the massive modules are also irreducible under the same criteria. When this criteria holds, every massive module decomposes into a direct sum of two BCCA-submodules, each of which we conjecture to be irreducible. Meanwhile, restricting Verma modules to the BCCA and $\mathcal{O}$ leads to free or ``almost free'' modules, which are not particularly interesting from a representation-theoretic viewpoint. This motivates the construction of BCCA modules intrinsically. To do this, we go through some structure theory on the BCCA to define a new basis and a decreasing filtration on the algebra, using which we construct Whittaker modules over the BCCA and the subalgebra $\mathcal{O}$ and prove criteria for their irreducibility.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper,we develop a novel representation of the zeta function expressed as the limiting difference between two structured double sums. This approach leads to a new and elegant identity involving maximum functions and additive terms, providing theoretical insights. The derivation relies on generalized harmonic series and polygamma functions, linking classical analysis with contemporary summation techniques.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00955v3'>2307.00955</a>\]&nbsp; **Combinatorics on Number Walls and the $P(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-31 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Steven Robertson &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 58 pages, 44 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any prime $p$ and real number and $\alpha$, the $p$-adic Littlewood Conjecture due to de Mathan and Teuli\'e asserts that $$\inf_{|m|\ge1}|m|_p\cdot |m|\cdot |\left\langle\alpha m\right\rangle|=0.$$ Above, $|m|$ is the usual absolute value, $|m|_p$ is the $p$-adic norm and $\left|\left\langle x\right\rangle\right|$ is the distance from $x\in\mathbb{R}$ to the nearest integer. Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field and $P(t)\in\mathbb{K}[t]$ be an irreducible polynomial. This paper deals with the analogue of this conjecture over the field of formal Laurent series over $\mathbb{K}$, known as the $P(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture ($P(t)$-LC). The following results are established: (1) Any counterexample to $P(t)$-LC for the case $P(t)=t$ generates a counterexample when $P(t)$ is any irreducible polynomial. Since $P(t)$-LC is knwon to be false when $P(t)=t$ and $\mathbb{K}$ has characteristic 0,3,5,7 and 11, one obtains a disproof of the $P(t)$-LC over any such field for any choice of irreducible polynomial $P(t)$. (2) A Khintchine-type theorem for $t$-adic multiplicative approximation is established, enabling one to determine the measure of the set of counterexamples to $P(t)$-LC with an additional monotonic growth function in the case $P(t)=t$. (3) The Hausdorff dimension of the same set is shown to be maximal when $P(t)=t$ in the critical case where the growth function is $\log^2$. These goals are achieved by developing an extensive theory in combinatorics relating $P(t)$-LC to the properties of the so-called number wall of a sequence. This is an infinite array containing the determinant of every finite Toeplitz matrix generated by that sequence. The main novelty of this paper is creating a dictionary allowing one to transfer statements in Diophantine approximation in positive characteristic to combinatorics through the concept of a number wall, and conversely.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages; this is version 2, compared to version 1, the paper has been restructured, in particular, results from the literature are moved to an appendix and several proofs now include previously omitted details

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We characterise quantitative semi-uniform stability for $C_0$-semigroups arising from port-Hamiltonian systems, complementing recent works on exponential and strong stability. With the result, we present a simple universal example class of port-Hamiltonian $C_0$-semigroups exhibiting arbitrary decay rates slower than $t^{-1/2}$. The latter is based on results from the theory of Diophantine approximation, as the decay rates will be strongly related to the approximation properties of irrational numbers by rationals obtained from cut-offs of continued fraction expansions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Dedicated to Karl-Hermann Neeb in honour of his 60th birthday, 19 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete subgroup of a unimodular locally compact group $G$. In Math. Ann. 388, 4251-4305 (2024), it was shown that the $L_p$ norm of a Fourier multiplier $m$ on $\Gamma$ can be bounded locally by its $L_p$-norm on $G$, modulo a constant $c(A)$ which depends on the support $A$ of $m$. In the context where $G$ is a connected Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, we develop tools to find explicit bounds on $c(A)$. We show that the problem reduces to: 1) The adjoint representation of the semisimple quotient $\mathfrak{s} = \mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{r}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ by the radical $\mathfrak{r}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ (which was handled in the paper mentioned above). 2) The action of $\mathfrak{s}$ on a set of real irreducible representations that arise from quotients of the commutator series of $\mathfrak{r}$. In particular, we show that $c(G) = 1$ for unimodular connected solvable Lie groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we use two different approaches -- one algebraic and the other analytic -- to study the variation of Iwasawa invariants of rational elliptic curves in some quadratic twist families. The analytic approach involves a thorough investigation of half-integral weight modular forms. On the other hand, the algebraic proof requires studying the BDP-Selmer groups and the fine Selmer groups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2, accepted version: slightly improved the main results, removed Section 8, changed numbering to match accepted version. 59 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the coherent cohomology of automorphic sheaves corresponding to Siegel modular forms $f$ of low weight on ${\rm GSp}(4)$ Shimura varieties. Inspired by the work of Prasanna--Venkatesh on singular cohomology of locally symmetric spaces, we propose a conjecture that explains all the contributions of a Hecke eigensystem to coherent cohomology in terms of the action of a motivic cohomology group. Under some technical conditions, we prove that our conjecture is equivalent to Beilinson's conjecture for the adjoint $L$-function of $f$. We also prove some unconditional results in special cases. For a lift $f$ of a Hilbert modular form $f_0$ to ${\rm GSp}(4)$, we produce elements in the motivic cohomology group for which the conjecture holds, using the results of Ramakrishnan on the Asai $L$-function of $f_0$. For a lift $f$ of a Bianchi modular form $f_0$ to ${\rm GSp}(4)$, we show that our conjecture for $f$ is equivalent to the conjecture of Prasanna-Venkatesh for $f_0$, thus establishing a connection between the motivic action conjectures for locally symmetric spaces of non-hermitian type and those for coherent cohomology of Shimura varieties.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 26 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal A$ be a hyperplane arrangement in a vector space $V$ and $G \leq GL(V)$ a group fixing $\mathcal A$. In case when $G$ is a complex reflection group and $\mathcal A=\mathcal A(G)$ is its reflection arrangement in $V$, Douglass, Pfeiffer, and R\"ohrle studied the invariants of the $Q G$-module $H^*(M(\mathcal A);Q)$, the rational, singular cohomology of the complement space $M(\mathcal A)$ in $V$. In this paper we generalize the work in Douglass, Pfeiffer, and R\"ohrle to the case of quaternionic reflection groups. We obtain a straightforward generalization of the Hilbert--Poincar\'e series of the ring of invariants in the cohomology from the complex case when the quaternionic reflection group is complex-reducible according to Cohen's classification. Surprisingly, only one additional family of new types of Poincar\'e polynomials occurs in the quaternionic setting which is not realised in the complex case, namely those of a particular class of imprimitive irreducible quaternionic reflection groups. Finally, we discuss bases of the space of $G$-invariants in $H^*(M(\mathcal A);Q)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a theory of noncommutative Poisson extensions. For an augmented dg algebra \(A\), we show that any shifted double Poisson bracket on \(A\) induces a graded Lie algebra structure on the reduced cyclic homology. Under the Kontsevich--Rosenberg principle, we further prove that the noncommutative Poisson extension is compatible with noncommutative Hamiltonian reduction. Moreover, we show that shifted double Poisson structures are independent of the choice of cofibrant resolutions and that they induce shifted Poisson structures on the derived moduli stack of representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct two representations of the twin group $T_n, n\geq 2$, namely $\eta_1: T_n \rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbb{F}_n)$ and $\eta_2: T_n \rightarrow \text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm 1}])$, where $\mathbb{F}_n$ is a free group with $n$ generators and $t$ is indeterminate. We then analyze some characteristics of these two representations, such as irreducibility and faithfulness. Moreover, we prove that both representations can be extended to the virtual twin group $VT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 2$, and we find their $2$-local extensions. On the other hand, we obtain a different result for the welded twin group $WT_n$. More deeply, we show that $\eta_1$ cannot be extended to $WT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 3$, while $\eta_2$ can be extended to $WT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 2$, and we find its $2$-local extensions.</p></details>

We select an arbitrary non-zero principal $\mathcal{A} $-ideal $ I_{\eta} $ of degree two. Notably, the $ I_{\eta} $-reduction of the tower of minimal Drinfeld modular curves is asymptotically optimal over the finite field $ \mathbb{F}_{q^4} $.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an identity for (torus-equivariant) 3-point, genus 0, $K$-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants of flag manifolds $G/P$, which can be thought of as a replacement for the ``divisor axiom'' in their (torus-equivariant) quantum $K$-theory. This identity enables us to compute these invariants when two insertions are Schubert classes and the other a Schubert divisor class. Our type-independent proof utilizes the Chevalley formula for the (torus-equivariant) quantum $K$-theory ring of flag manifolds, which computes multiplications by Schubert divisor classes in terms of the quantum Bruhat graph.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we consider a generalization of the McKay correspondence in positive characteristic regarding the Euler characteristic of crepant resolutions of quotient singularities given by finite subgroups of the special linear group. As the main result, we prove that this generalization holds for groups with a specific semidirect product structure, using the wild McKay correspondence over finite fields as mass formulas. Furthermore, two additional examples with more complicated structures are also given. Based on our main result, we propose a conjectural form of the generalized McKay correspondence in the modular case.</p></details>

We show unconditionally that the image of an irreducible mod 2 symplectic 4-dimensional Galois representation that is unramified outside 2 must be large. Under GRH, we then deduce the non-existence of such representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the family of algebraic curves of genus $\geq 1$ defined by the affine equations $y^s=ax^r+b$ over a number field $k$, where $r \geq 2$ and $s\geq 2$ are fixed integers. Assuming the strong version of Lang's conjecture on varieties of general type, we prove that the Mordell-Weil rank of the Jacobian varieties of these curves is uniformly bounded. The proof proceeds by constructing a parameter space for curves in the family with a given number of rational points and analyzing the geometry of its fibers, which are shown to be complete intersection curves of increasing genus.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Polynomial optimization problems often arise in sequences indexed by dimension, and it is of interest to compute bounds on the optimal values of all problems in the sequence. Examples include certifying inequalities between symmetric functions or graph homomorphism densities that hold over vectors and graphs of all sizes, and computing the value of mean-field games viewed as limits of games with a growing number of players. In this paper, we study such any-dimensional polynomial problems using the theory of representation stability, and we develop a systematic framework to produce hierarchies of bounds for their limiting optimal values in terms of finite-dimensional polynomial optimization problems. In this paper, we study such any-dimensional polynomial problems using the theory of representation stability, and we develop a systematic framework to produce sequences of improving bounds on their limiting optimal values. Our bounds are obtained by solving finite-dimensional polynomial optimization problems (or their relaxations). These bounds converge at explicit rates, and they follow as a consequence of new de Finetti-type theorems pertaining to sequences of random arrays projecting onto each other in different ways. The proofs of these theorems are based on applying results from probability to representations of certain categories. We apply our framework to produce new bounds on problems arising in a number of application domains such as mean-field games, extremal graph theory, and symmetric function theory, and we illustrate our methods via numerical experiments.</p></details>
