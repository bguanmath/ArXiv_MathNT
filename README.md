 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Du Pei &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** hep-th &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study skein modules of 3-manifolds by embedding them into the Hilbert spaces of 4d ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theories. When the 3-manifold has reduced holonomy, we present an algorithm to determine the dimension and the list of generators of the skein module with a general gauge group. The analysis uses a deformation preserving ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry to express the dimension as a sum over nilpotent orbits. We find that the dimensions often differ between Langlands-dual pairs beyond the A-series, for which we provide a physical explanation involving chiral symmetry breaking and 't Hooft operators. We also relate our results to the structure of $\mathbb{C}^*$-fixed loci in the moduli space of Higgs bundles. This approach helps to clarify the relation between the gauge-theoretic framework of Kapustin and Witten with other versions of the geometric Langlands program, explains why the dimensions of skein modules do not exhibit a TQFT-like behavior, and provides a physical interpretation of the skein-valued curve counting of Ekholm and Shende.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gregorio Vettori &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 29 pages, 17 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a unified density-based framework for primality, coprimality, and prime pairs, and introduce an intrinsic normalized model for prime gaps constrained by the Prime Number Theorem. Within this setting, a structural tension between Hardy-Littlewood, Cramer, and PNT predictions emerges, leading to quantitative estimates on the rarity of extreme gaps. Additive representations of even integers are reformulated as local density problems, yielding non-conjectural upper and lower bounds compatible with Hardy-Littlewood heuristics. Finally, the Riemann zeta function is analyzed via truncated Euler products, whose stability and oscillatory structure provide a coherent interpretation of the critical line and prime-based numerical criteria for the localization of non-trivial zeros.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jorge Fariña-Asategui, Santiago Radi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1980, Odoni initiated the study of the fixed-point proportion of iterated Galois groups of polynomials motivated by prime density problems in arithmetic dynamics. The main goal of the present paper is to completely settle the longstanding open problem of computing the fixed-point proportion of geometric iterated Galois groups of polynomials. Indeed, we confirm the well-known conjecture that Chebyshev polynomials are the only complex polynomials whose geometric iterated Galois groups have positive fixed-point proportion. Our proof relies on methods from group theory, ergodic theory, martingale theory and complex dynamics. This result has direct applications to the proportion of periodic points of polynomials over finite fields. The general framework developed in this paper applies more generally to rational functions over arbitrary fields and generalizes, via a unified approach, previous partial results, which have all been proved with very different methods.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Justin Trias &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 28 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the Weil representation over a non-archimedean local field can be realised with coefficients in a number field. We give an explicit descent argument to describe precisely which number field the Weil representation descends to. Our methods also apply over more general coefficient fields, such as $\ell$-modular coefficient fields, as well as coefficient rings such as rings of integers i.e. in families. We also prove that the theta correspondence over a perfect field is valid if and only if it is valid over the algebraic closure of this perfect field. These two results together show that the classical local theta correspondence is rational.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Diego Céspedes, Sebastián Donoso &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DS &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show the failure of the pointwise convergence of averages along the Omega function in a number field. As a consequence, we show, for instance, that the averages $$ \frac{1}{N^2}\sum_{1\leq m,n \leq N} f(T^{Ω(m^2+n^2)}x)$$ do not converge pointwise in ergodic systems, addressing a question posed by Le, Moreira, Sun, and the second author. On the other hand, using number-theoretic methods, we establish the pointwise convergence of averages along the $Ω$ function defined on the ideals of a number field in uniquely ergodic systems. Using this dynamical framework, we also derive several natural number-theoretic consequences of independent interest.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Justin Trias &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 35 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field of characteristic different from $2$ and of residual characteristic $p$. We generalise the theory of the Weil representation over $F$ with complex coefficients to $\ell$-modular representations \textit{i.e.} when the complex coefficients are replaced by a coefficient field $R$ of characteristic $\ell \neq p$. We obtain along the way a generalisation of the Stone-von Neumann theorem to the $\ell$-modular setting, together with the Weil representation with coefficients in $R$ on the $R$-metaplectic group. Surprisingly enough, the latter $R$-metaplectic group happens to be split over the symplectic group if $\ell = 2$. The theory also makes sense when $F$ is a finite field of odd characteristic. We also establish the irreducibility of the theta lift in the cuspidal case as long as $\ell$ does not divide the pro-orders of the groups at stake and we provide a compatibility to congruences in this setting via an integral version of the theta lift.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zhaolin Li &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Extend the previous results to general Hecke elements

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>According to the relative Langlands functoriality conjecture, an admissible morphism between the $L$-groups of spherical varieties should induce a functorial transfer of the corresponding local and global automorphic spectra. Via the relative trace formula approach, two basic problems are the local transfer and the fundamental lemma on the geometric side of the relative trace formulae. In this paper, we consider the rank one spherical variety case, where the admissible morphism between the $L$-groups is the identity morphism, in which case, Y. Sakellaridis has already established the local transfer. We formulate the statement of the fundamental lemma for the general rank one spherical variety case and prove the fundamental lemma for the rank one spherical varieties of classical types.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 9 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We discuss algorithms for arithmetic properties of hypergeometric functions. Most notably, we are able to compute the p-adic valuation of a hypergeometric function on any disk of radius smaller than the p-adic radius of convergence. This we use, building on work of Christol, to determine the set of prime numbers modulo which it can be reduced. Moreover, we describe an algorithm to find an annihilating polynomial of the reduction of a hypergeometric function modulo p.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show how monoidal adjunctions can be used to prove the existence of monoidal abelian envelopes of pseudo-tensor categories, in particular, those admitting a combinatorial description with certain properties. We derive concrete general criteria that we demonstrate by giving relatively simple combinatorial proofs of the existence of new abelian envelopes for interpolation categories of the hyperoctahedral and of the modified symmetric groups.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18127v3'>2412.18127</a>\]&nbsp; **$N=1$ super Virasoro tensor categories**

> **Comment:** Minor revisions for clarity and references updated. Final version, to appear in Communications in Mathematical Physics

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the category of $C_1$-cofinite modules for the universal $N=1$ super Virasoro vertex operator superalgebra $\mathcal{S}(c,0)$ at any central charge $c$ is locally finite and admits the vertex algebraic braided tensor category structure of Huang-Lepowsky-Zhang. For central charges $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t)=\frac{15}{2}-3(t+t^{-1})$ with $t\notin\mathbb{Q}$, we show that this tensor category is semisimple, rigid, and slightly degenerate, and we determine its fusion rules. For central charge $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(1)=\frac{3}{2}$, we show that this tensor category is rigid and that its simple modules have the same fusion rules as $\mathrm{Rep}\,\mathfrak{osp}(1\vert 2)$, in agreement with earlier fusion rule calculations of Milas. Finally, for the remaining central charges $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t)$ with $t\in \mathbb{Q}^\times$, we show that the simple $\mathcal{S}(c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t),0)$-module $\mathcal{S}_{2,2}$ of lowest conformal weight $h^{\mathfrak{ns}}_{2,2}(t)=\frac{3(t-1)^2}{8t}$ is rigid and self-dual, except possibly when $t^{\pm 1}$ is a negative integer or when $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t)$ is the central charge of a rational $N=1$ superconformal minimal model. As $\mathcal{S}_{2,2}$ is expected to generate the category of $C_1$-cofinite $\mathcal{S}(c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t),0)$-modules under fusion, rigidity of $\mathcal{S}_{2,2}$ is the first key step to proving rigidity of this category for general $t\in\mathbb{Q}^\times$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Barinder S. Banwait, Xiaoyu Huang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recent work of Burungale-Skinner-Tian-Wan established the first infinite families of quadratic twists of non-CM elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ for which the strong Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) conjecture holds. Building on their results, we encode the required hypotheses into an explicit algorithm and apply it to the database of elliptic curves in the $L$-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB), identifying all elliptic curves $E$ of conductor at most $500{,}000$ that admit infinitely many quadratic twists satisfying the strong BSD conjecture. Our computations provide certain numerical evidence for a conjecture of Radziwiłł and Soundararajan predicting Gaussian behavior in the analytic order of the Shafarevich-Tate group, while also observing a systematic positive bias within the BSD-satisfying subfamily.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Andreas Maurischat &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 28 pages, several tikz-figures, v1->v2: fixed typos and improved presentation suggested by the referee, accepted for publication in Acta Arithmetica

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Anderson t-modules are analogs of abelian varieties in positive characteristic. Associated to such a t-module, there are its t-motive and its dual t-motive. When dealing with these objects, several questions occur which one would like to solve algorithmically. For example, for a given t-module one would like to decide whether its t-motive is indeed finitely generated free, and determine a basis. Reversely, for a given object in the category of t-motives one would like to decide whether it is the t-motive associated to a t-module, and determine that t-module. In this article, we positively answer such questions by providing the corresponding algorithms. As it turned out, the main part of all these algorithms stem from a single algorithm in non-commutative algebra, and hence the first part of this article doesn't deal with Anderson's objects at all, but are results on finitely generated modules over skew polynomial rings.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 13 pages, Comments Welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a precise definition of mutation of skew symmetrizable matrices over group rings and relate it to folding and mutation of quivers with symmetries. These matrices can have non-zero diagonal entries and we explain a mutation rule in some of these cases as well. This new rule comes from a notion of a generalized mutation of an entire quiver or sub-quiver.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: 46 pages; update of the presentation of prior results in the introduction, references added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a weak form of formality for differential graded algebras, called $A_3$-formality, for the cohomology of pro-p Demushkin groups at odd primes p. We show that the differential graded $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebras of continuous cochains of Demushkin groups with q-invariant not equal 3 are $A_3$-formal, whereas Demushkin groups with q-invariant 3 are not $A_3$-formal. We prove these results by an explicit computation of the Benson-Krause-Schwede canonical class in Hochschild cohomology.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Chahat Ahuja &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The visibility of lattice points from the origin along a polynomial family of curves constitutes a significant generalization of visibility along straight lines. Following the classical notion, where the density equals 1/2, and its generalization to monomial curves of the form y = a x^b, where the density equals 1/(b+1), we study a family of polynomial curves defined by y = q(a_n x^n + ... + a_1 x), where q is a positive rational number. We introduce a new criterion based on a polynomial greatest common divisor condition that provides a lower bound on the number of visible lattice points in N^2. Conversely, we derive conditions under which a given lattice point becomes the next visible point along such a polynomial curve. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we also obtain an exact double-sum formula for the number of pairs (a, b) less than or equal to N that are visible with respect to this polynomial family. Finally, we extend the framework to related problems and pose several open questions concerning gap distributions and quantitative bounds for non-visible points. This work provides a broader theoretical foundation for lattice point visibility beyond linear and monomial settings.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 47 pages, modified the proofs of some assertions

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the rationality problem for multinorm one tori, a natural generalization of norm one tori. For multinorm one tori that split over finite Galois extensions with nilpotent Galois group, we prove that stable rationality and retract rationality are equivalent, and give a criterion for the validity of the above two conditions. This generalizes the result of Endo (2011) on the rationality problem for norm one tori. To accomplish it, we introduce a generalization of character groups of multinorm one tori. Moreover, we establish systematic reduction methods originating in work of Endo (2001) for an investigation of the rationality problem for arbitrary multinorm one tori. In addition, we provide a new example for which the multinorm principle holds.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Rankin--Cohen brackets provide a basic example of ``non-elementary" differential symmetry breaking operators. They can be interpreted as bi-differential operators remarkable for reflecting the structure of fusion rules for holomorphic discrete series representations of the Lie group $SL(2,\mathbb R)$ and are intimately connected to classical special polynomials. In this introductory article, we explore the combinatorial structure of these operators and discuss a general framework for constructing their higher-dimensional analogues from the representation-theoretic perspective on branching problems. The exposition is based on lectures delivered by the authors during the thematic semester ``Representation Theory and Noncommutative Geometry", held in Spring 2025 at the Henri Poincaré Institute in Paris.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 65 pages. final version, to appear in Journal of the AMS

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a theory of (etale) Berkovich motives. This is closely related to Ayoub's theory of rigid-analytic motives, but works uniformly in the archimedean and nonarchimedean setting. We aim for a self-contained treatment, not relying on previous work on algebraic or analytic motives. Applying the theory to discrete fields, one still recovers the etale version of Voevodsky's theory. Two notable features of our setting which do not hold in other settings are that over any base, the cancellation theorem holds true, and under only minor assumptions on the base, the stable $\infty$-category of motivic sheaves is rigid dualizable.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a condensable algebra in a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$. We define an action of the fusion category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ on the morphism space $\mbox{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(x,A)$ for any $x$ in $\mathcal{C}$, whose characters are generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of the Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\mathcal{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\mathcal{B}$ to $A^\mathcal{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOAs, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\mathcal{C}_A}$ where $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{M}_U$ is the category of $U$-modules. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\mathcal{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the mode transition algebras and Zhu algebras in the setting of $\mathbb{Z}$-graded vertex algebras, with particular focus on the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 (also known as bosonic ghosts or the $βγ$-system). We show that the mode transition algebras of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 admit unity elements that form a family of strong unities in the sense of Damiolini-Gibney-Krashen. The existence of unities for the mode transition algebra of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 allows us to explicitly construct all higher level Zhu algebras of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2. We further analyze weak modules of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 induced from Zhu algebras, proving that every such module is already induced from the level-zero Zhu algebra. We then prove that all indecomposable reducible weight modules induced from a Zhu algebra are not weakly interlocked, and hence not strongly interlocked in the sense of Barron-Batistelli-Orosz Hunziker-Yamskulna. More generally, we show that the property of being weakly interlocked is preserved under the action of an invertible Li's $\mathbfΔ$ operator. As an application, we prove that all indecomposable reducible weight modules of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 obtained via spectral flow of Zhu-induced modules are likewise not weakly interlocked. These results clarify the role of being weakly interlocked in the modularity properties of bosonic ghost modules previously studied by Ridout-Wood and Allen-Wood.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $V$ be an $\mathbb{N}$-graded, simple, self-contragredient, $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra. We show that if the $S$-transformation of the character of $V$ is a linear combination of characters of $V$-modules, then the category $\mathcal{C}$ of grading-restricted generalized $V$-modules is a rigid tensor category. We further show, without any assumption on the character of $V$ but assuming that $\mathcal{C}$ is rigid, that $\mathcal{C}$ is a factorizable finite ribbon category, that is, a not-necessarily-semisimple modular tensor category. As a consequence, we show that if the Zhu algebra of $V$ is semisimple, then $\mathcal{C}$ is semisimple and thus $V$ is rational. The proofs of these theorems use techniques and results from tensor categories together with the method of Moore-Seiberg and Huang for deriving identities of two-point genus-one correlation functions associated to $V$. We give two main applications. First, we prove the conjecture of Kac-Wakimoto and Arakawa that $C_2$-cofinite affine $W$-algebras obtained via quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction of admissible-level affine vertex algebras are strongly rational. The proof uses the recent result of Arakawa and van Ekeren that such $W$-algebras have semisimple (Ramond twisted) Zhu algebras. Second, we use our rigidity results to reduce the "coset rationality problem" to the problem of $C_2$-cofiniteness for the coset. That is, given a vertex operator algebra inclusion $U\otimes V\hookrightarrow A$ with $A$, $U$ strongly rational and $U$, $V$ a pair of mutual commutant subalgebras in $A$, we show that $V$ is also strongly rational provided it is $C_2$-cofinite.</p></details>

We also verify the equality for certain Iwahori-spherical representations occurring in regular unramified principal series; this uses and generalizes the earlier work of Karasiewicz--Okada--Wang on theta representations.

We first show that every nontrivial irreducible complex character of $H$ induces homogeneously to $G$ if and only if for every $x\in G\setminus H$, the element $x$ is conjugate to $xh$ for all $h\in H$. Furthermore we prove that if $xh$ is conjugate to either $x$ or $x^{-1}$ for all $h\in H$ and all $x\in G\setminus H$, then the normal closure $N$ of $H$ in $G$ also satisfies the same condition, and $N$ is nilpotent. Finally, we determine the structure of $H$ under the assumption that for every element $x\in G\setminus H$ of odd order, the coset $xH$ consists entirely of elements of odd order.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Consider the $(\mathfrak{g}, K)$-modules $L_λ$ for unitary highest weight representations of the real reductive group $G_{\mathbb{R}} = \mathrm{U}(p,q)$, $\mathrm{Mp}(2n, \mathbb{R})$, or $\mathrm{O}^*(2n)$, where $\mathrm{Mp}(2n,\mathbb{R})$ denotes the metaplectic double cover of $\mathrm{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{R})$. Let $k$ be a positive integer. Corresponding to $G_{\mathbb{R}}$ via Howe duality is the compact group $\mathrm{U}(k)$, $\mathrm{O}(k)$, or $\mathrm{Sp}(k)$, respectively, for which every irreducible representation $σ$ corresponds to a unique $L_λ = L_{λ(σ)}$. Nishiyama-Ochiai-Taniguchi (2001) expressed the Bernstein degree $\mathrm{Deg} L_{λ(σ)}$ as the product of $\dim σ$ and the degree of the associated variety of $L_{λ(σ)}$; this result is valid when $k \leq r :=$ the real rank of $G_{\mathbb{R}}$. In this paper, for arbitrary $k$, we give a new combinatorial interpretation $\mathrm{Deg} L_{λ(σ)} = \#(\mathcal{Q}_k(σ) \times \mathcal{P}_k)$, where $\mathcal{Q}_k(σ)$ is a certain set of semistandard tableaux, whose cardinality (for $k \geq r$) interpolates between $\dim σ$ and the dimension of the simple $K$-module with highest weight $λ(σ)$. The set $\mathcal{P}_k$ consists of certain plane partitions that encode the Hilbert series of the associated variety. We exhibit analogous sets $\mathcal{P}_k$ of plane partitions for all real reductive groups of Hermitian type, including the exceptional groups.</p></details>

We give an explicit conjecture for the form of this period formula, which relates the height of special points on a Shimura surface with special values of $L$-functions.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper aims to employ a cluster-theoretic approach to provide a class of Diophantine equations whose solutions can be obtained by starting from initial solutions through mutations. We establish a novel framework bridging cluster theory and Diophantine equations through the lens of cluster symmetry. On the one hand, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for Laurent polynomials to remain invariant under a given cluster symmetric map. On the other hand, we construct a discriminant algorithm to determine whether a given Laurent polynomial has cluster symmetry and whether it can be realized in a generalized cluster algebra. As applications, we solve Markov-cluster equations, describe some invariant Laurent polynomial rings, and resolve the questions posed by Gyoda and Matsushita.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 53 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent work, Harman and Snowden constructed a symmetric tensor category associated to an oligomorphic group equipped with a measure. The oligomorphic group $\mathbb{G}$ of order preserving automorphisms of the real line admits exactly four measures. The category $\mathcal{C}$ associated to the first measure is called the (first) Delannoy category; it is semi-simple and pre-Tannakian, with numerous special properties. In this paper, we study the (non-abelian) category $\mathcal{A}$ associated to the second measure, which we call the second Delannoy category. We construct a new pre-Tannakian category $\mathcal{D}$ together with a fully faithful tensor functor $Ψ\colon \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{D}$. The category $\mathcal{D}$ is the correct ``abelian version'' of the second Delannoy category. Like $\mathcal{C}$, it has remarkable properties: for instance, it is non-semi-simple, but behaves uniformly in the coefficient field (e.g., it has the same Grothendieck ring and $\mathrm{Ext}^1$ quiver over any field). Additionally, we completely solve the problem of understanding how $\mathcal{A}$ relates to general pre-Tannakian categories. We show that $\mathcal{A}$ admits exactly two local abelian envelopes: the functor $Ψ$, and a previously constructed functor $Φ\colon \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{C}$. This is the first case where the local envelopes of a category have been completely determined, outside of cases where there is at most one envelope. This work opens the door to constructing abelian versions of other oligomorphic tensor categories that do not admit a unique envelope.</p></details>

For $[E]\in \mathcal{W}_n^{\min}$, let $S \to \mathbb{P}^1_{k}$ be the associated elliptic surface with section. Motivated by the Shioda-Tate formula, we consider the trivariate motivic height zeta function $$ \mathcal{Z}(u,v;t):= \sum_{n\ge0}\Bigl(\sum_{[E]\in \mathcal{W}_n^{\min}} u^{T(S)}v^{\mathrm{rk}(E/K)}\Bigr)t^n \in K_0(\mathrm{Stck}_k)[u,v][[t]] $$ which refines the height series by weighting each height stratum with the trivial lattice rank $T(S)$ and the Mordell--Weil rank $\mathrm{rk}(E/K)$. We prove rationality for the trivial lattice specialization $Z_{\mathrm{Triv}}(u;t)=\mathcal{Z}(u,1;t)$ by giving an explicit finite Euler product.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(G_n)_{n\geqslant 0}$ be a linear recurrence sequence defining a numeration system and satisfying mild structural hypotheses. For real-valued G-additive functions (additive in the greedy G-digits), we establish an Erdős-Wintner-type theorem: convergence of two canonical series (a first-moment series and a quadratic digit-energy series) is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a limiting distribution along initial segments of the integers. In that case, the limiting characteristic function admits an explicit infinite-product factorization whose local factors depend only on the underlying digit system. We also indicate conditional extensions of this two-series criterion to Ostrowski numeration systems with bounded partial quotients and to Parry $β$-expansions with Pisot-Vijayaraghavan base $β$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $γ=0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $δ=0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $γ+δ/e=\mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $γ^{(n)}+δ^{(n)}/e=η^{(n)}$, $n\ge0$ for sequences of constants $γ^{(n)}$, $δ^{(n)}$, and $η^{(n)}$ (given respectively by raw, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). Investigating the $γ^{(n)}=\left(-1\right)^{n}Γ^{(n)}(1)$ through recurrence relations, we find that the $γ^{(n)}$ are transcendental infinitely often and that at least two of each set {$γ,γ^{(n)},γ^{(n+1)},...,γ^{(2n)}$}, for $2\leq n\leq26$, are transcendental (with analogous results for $Γ^{(n)}(1)$). We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $η^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent, and therefore transcendental, for all $n\ge0$, implying that at least one of each pair, {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e$} and {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e,δ^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n\ge1$. Further analysis of the $γ^{(n)}$ and $η^{(n)}$ reveals that the $δ^{(n)}/e$ and $δ^{(n)}$ are transcendental infinitely often with asymptotic densities of at least 1/2. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tildeδ^{(n)}$ and $\tildeη^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $γ^{(n)}+\tildeδ^{(n)}/e=\tildeη^{(n)}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a deterministic polynomial time algorithm to compute the endomorphism ring of a supersingular elliptic curve in characteristic p, provided that we are given two noncommuting endomorphisms and the factorization of the discriminant of the ring $\mathcal{O}_0$ they generate. At each prime $q$ for which $\mathcal{O}_0$ is not maximal, we compute the endomorphism ring locally by computing a q-maximal order containing it and, when $q \neq p$, recovering a path to $\text{End}(E) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_q$ in the Bruhat-Tits tree. We use techniques of higher-dimensional isogenies to navigate towards the local endomorphism ring. Our algorithm improves on a previous algorithm which requires a restricted input and runs in subexponential time under certain heuristics. Page and Wesolowski give a probabilistic polynomial time algorithm to compute the endomorphism ring on input of a single non-scalar endomorphism. Beyond using techniques of higher-dimensional isogenies to divide endomorphisms by a scalar, our methods are completely different.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>At the beginning of this century, Langlands introduced a strategy known as \emph{Beyond Endoscopy} to attack the principle of functoriality. Altuğ studied $\mathsf{GL}_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ in the unramified setting. The first step involves isolating specific representations, especially the residual part of the spectral side, in the elliptic part of the geometric side of the trace formula. We generalize this step to the case with ramification at $S=\{\infty,q_1,\dots,q_r\}$ with $2\in S$, thereby fully resolving the problem of isolating these representations over $\mathbb{Q}$ which remained unresolved for over a decade. Such a formula that isolates the specific representations is derived by modifying Altuğ's approach. We use the approximate functional equation to ensure the validity of the Poisson summation formula. Then, we compute the residues of specific functions to isolate the desired representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We identify additional structure on a conservative lax monoidal functor from a closed monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$ to a Grothendieck-Verdier category $\mathcal{D}$, such that the Grothendieck-Verdier structure of $\mathcal{D}$ lifts to $\mathcal{C}$ and the functor becomes Frobenius linearly distributive. As an application, we recover and extend conditions under which modules over Hopf monads and Hopf algebroids inherit Grothendieck-Verdier structures. We also characterize when categories of bimodules, modules, and local modules over (commutative) algebras internal to a Grothendieck-Verdier category admit such structures. Our results apply to quantales, smash product algebras, skew group algebras, and enveloping algebras of Lie-Rinehart algebras. For applications of the lifting theorem, we construct a strict $2$-equivalence between a $2$-category of Grothendieck-Verdier categories and one of linearly distributive categories with negation, and extend this $2$-equivalence to the braided setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The problem of solving non-linear equations would be considerably simplified by a possibility to convert known solutions into the new ones. This could seem an element of art, but in the context of ADHM-like equations describing quiver varieties there is a systematic approach. In this note we study moduli spaces and dualities of quiver gauge theories associated to effective dynamics of D-branes compactified on Calabi-Yau resolutions. We concentrate on a subfamily of quivers $\mathfrak{Q}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ covering Dynkin diagrams for simple Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$, where the respective BPS algebra is expected to be the Yangian algebra $Y(\mathfrak{g})$. For Yangians labeled by quivers their representations are described by solutions of ADHM-like equations. As quivers substitute Dynkin diagrams a generalization of the Weyl group $\mathcal{W}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ acts on the ADHM solutions. Here we work with the case $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$ and treat this group as a group of electro-magnetic Seiberg-like dualities (we call them Weyl mutations) on the respective quiver gauge theories. We lift it to the case of higher representations associated to rectangular Young diagrams. An action of Weyl mutations on the BPS Yangian algebra is also discussed.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The aim of this article is to present in a self-contained way identities arising in elementary number theory, among which the following one: $$ \sum_{d\mid n}\frac{μ^2(d)}{\varphi(d)\,d^s}=\prod_{p\mid n}\left(1+\frac{1}{(p-1)p^s}\right). $$ This formula expresses a non-trivial divisor sum involving the Möbius function $μ$ and Euler's totient function $\varphi$ as a simple and explicit multiplicative expression. This is a generalization of the remarkable Dineva formula, which corresponds to $s=0$ and gives $n/\varphi(n)$ on the right-hand side. We explain why only squarefree divisors are involved, show how multiplicativity naturally comes into play, and interpret the identity as a finite Euler product. Beyond this one-parameter family of generalizations, we describe a general method for constructing similar formulas and present several examples. Finally, we reformulate these identities in terms of partial zeta functions, thus emphasizing their close relationship with the classical theory of Euler products and the Riemann zeta function. The connection with the Selberg sieve is briefly outlined.</p></details>

In this article, we prove that the Néron-Tate height of totally $p$-adic points is bounded below by an absolute constant depending only on $A$ for all but finitely many primes. In other words, if we denote by $\mathbb{Q}^{(p)}$ the maximal algebraic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ in which $p$ is totally split, then $A(\mathbb{Q}^{(p)})$ satisfies the Bogomolov property for all but finitely many primes. In particular, if $A$ has good reduction at a prime $p$, we obtain the Bogomolov property $A(\Q^{(p)})$. This is the first instance where such a result has been obtained in the good reduction case. In a more general setting, if $A/K$ is an abelian variety and $\mathcal{K}/K$ is an asymptotically positive extension as defined in \cite{AB-SK}, which includes infinite Galois extensions with finite local degree at a non-archimedean place, then $A(\mathcal{K})$ satisfies the Bogomolov property.</p></details>

We prove that the following statements hold for infinitely many values of $p$. $(2-\varepsilon)$-$\mathsf{GapSVP}_p$ is not in $O\left(2^{O(p)}\cdot n^{O(1)}\right)$-time, unless $\text{P}=\text{NP}$. $(2-\varepsilon)$-$\mathsf{GapSVP}_p$ is not in $O\left(2^{2^{o(p)}}\cdot 2^{o(n)}\right)$-time, unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis is false. The proofs are based on a Karp reduction from a variant of the subset-sum problem that imposes restrictions on vectors orthogonal to the vector of its weights.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a writeup of a resolution of Erdős Problem #728; this is the first Erdős problem (a problem proposed by Paul Erdős which has been collected in the Erdős Problems website) regarded as fully resolved autonomously by an AI system. The system in question is a combination of GPT-5.2 Pro by OpenAI and Aristotle by Harmonic, operated by Kevin Barreto. The final result of the system is a formal proof written in Lean, which we translate to informal mathematics in the present writeup for wider accessibility. The proved result is as follows. We show a logarithmic-gap phenomenon regarding factorial divisibility: For any constants $0<C_1<C_2$ and $0 < \varepsilon < 1/2$ there exist infinitely many triples $(a,b,n)\in\mathbb N^3$ with $\varepsilon n \le a,b \le (1-\varepsilon)n$ such that $$ a!\,b!\mid n!\,(a+b-n)!\qquad\text{and}\qquad C_1\log n < a+b-n < C_2\log n. $$ The argument reduces this to a binomial divisibility $\binom{m+k}{k}\mid\binom{2m}{m}$ and studies it prime-by-prime. By Kummer's theorem, $ν_p\binom{2m}{m}$ translates into a carry count for doubling $m$ in base $p$. We then employ a counting argument to find, in each scale $[M,2M]$, an integer $m$ whose base-$p$ expansions simultaneously force many carries when doubling $m$, for every prime $p\le 2k$, while avoiding the rare event that one of $m+1,\dots,m+k$ is divisible by an unusually high power of $p$. These "carry-rich but spike-free" choices of $m$ force the needed $p$-adic inequalities and the divisibility. The overall strategy is similar to results regarding divisors of $\binom{2n}{n}$ studied earlier by Erdős and by Pomerance.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A partition is a $t$-core partition if $t$ is not one of its hook lengths. Let $c_t(N)$ be the number of $t$-core partitions of $N$. In 1999, Stanton conjectured $c_t(N) \le c_{t+1}(N)$ if $4 \le t \ne N-1$. This was proved for $t$ fixed and $N$ sufficiently large by Anderson, and for small values of $t$ by Kim and Rouse. In this paper, we prove Stanton's conjecture in general. Our approach is to find a saddle point asymptotic formula for $c_t(N)$, valid in all ranges of $t$ and $N$. This includes the known asymptotic formulas for $c_t(N)$ as special cases, and shows that the behavior of $c_t(N)$ depends on how $t^2$ compares in size to $N$. For example, our formula implies that if $t^2 = κN + o(t)$, then $c_t(N) = \frac{\exp\left(2π\sqrt{A N}\right)}{B N} (1 + o(1))$ for suitable constants $A$ and $B$ defined in terms of $κ$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We answer a question of Serre from the 1980s on rational points of bounded height on projective thin sets, in degree at least $4$. For degrees $2$ and $3$ we improve the known bounds in general. The focus is on thin sets of type II, namely corresponding to the images of ramified dominant quasi-finite covers of projective space, as thin sets of type I are already well understood via dimension growth results by the third author in 2002 (published in 2023) by a global variant of Heath-Brown's $p$-adic determinant method. For type II, we obtain a uniform affine variant of Serre's question which implies the projective case and for which the implicit constant is furthermore polynomial in the degree. We are able to avoid logarithmic factors when the degree is at least $5$ and we prove our results over any global field, of any characteristic. A key ingredient for obtaining the affine variant comes from Binyamini-Cluckers-Novikov (2024) and Binyamini-Cluckers-Kato (2025) where a question of the third author was answered by providing bounds, for rational points on irreducible curves, which are quadratic in the degree. A second key ingredient is an adaptation of Salberger's global determinant method to the case of weighted polynomials. The third key ingredient is the design of our affine variant of Serre's question, for weighted polynomials which are not necessarily weighted homogeneous.</p></details>

The number of integers $n$ such that $f(n)$ is $k$-free is widely studied in the literature. In principle, one expects that $f(n)$ is $k$-free infinitely often, if $f$ has no fixed $k$-th power divisor. In 2022, Bergelson and Richter established a new dynamical generalization of the prime number theorem (PNT). Inspired by their work, one may expect that this generalization of the PNT also holds over integers of power-free polynomial values.

In this paper, we prove that Bringmann's formula, when summing up to infinity and in the case of prime modulus, gives a Rademacher-type exact formula involving sums of vector-valued Kloosterman sums. As a corollary, in another paper arXiv:2406.07469 [math.NT], we will provide a new proof of Dyson's conjectures by showing that the certain Kloosterman sums vanish.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the context of $p$-adic quantum mechanics, we investigate composite systems of $p$-adic qubits and $p$-adically controlled quantum logic gates. We build on the notion of a single $p$-adic qubit as a two-dimensional irreducible representation of the compact $p$-adic special orthogonal group SO(3)$_p$. We show that the classification of these representations reduces to the finite case, as they all factorise through some finite quotient SO(3)$_p$ mod $p^k$. Then, we tackle the problem of $p$-adic qubit composition and entanglement, fundamental for a $p$-adic formulation of quantum information processing. We classify the representations of SO(3)$_p$ mod $p$, and analyse tensor products of two $p$-adic qubit representations lifted from SO(3)$_p$ mod $p$. We solve the Clebsch-Gordan problem for such systems, revealing that the coupled bases decompose into singlet and doublet states. We further study entanglement arising from those stable subsystems. For $p=3$, we construct a set of gates from $4$-dimensional irreducible representations of SO(3)$_p$ mod $p$ that we prove to be universal for quantum computation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we first introduce the concept of Nijenhuis BiHom-Lie algebras. We then establish the equivalence relations between the Manin triples of Nijenhuis BiHom-Lie algebras, Nijenhuis BiHom-Lie bialgebras, and matched pairs of Nijenhuis BiHom-Lie algebras. Furthermore, we show that such an equivalence also holds for differential Lie bialgebras, together with their associated Manin triples and corresponding matched pairs.</p></details>
