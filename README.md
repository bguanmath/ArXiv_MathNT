### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10594v1'>2511.10594</a>\]&nbsp; **On binary correlations of Fourier coefficients of holomorphic cusp forms at prime arguments**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jiseong Kim, Kunjakanan Nath &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\{λ_f(n)\}_{n \geq 1}$ be the normalized Hecke eigenvalues of a given holomorphic cusp form $f$ of even weight $k$. We show under the assumption of the existence of Littlewood's type zero free region for $L(s, f, χ)$, where $χ$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $q$, that if $X^{2/3+\varepsilon} \ll H \ll X^{1-\varepsilon}$ with $\varepsilon>0$, then for any $A\geq 1$, $$\sum_{1\leq |h|\leq H}\bigg| \sum_{\substack{X<n,\: m \leq 2X \\ n - m = h}} λ_f(n)Λ(n)λ_f(m)Λ(m) \bigg|^2 \ll_{A} \frac{HX^2}{(\log X)^{A}}$$ holds. Moreover, under an additional hypothesis on the fourth moment of certain Dirichlet polynomials (which follows from GRH for $L(s, f)$), we show that the above result can be strengthened to hold in a wider range $X^{1/3+\varepsilon}\ll H \ll X^{1-\varepsilon}$. Finally, if we average over the forms $f$, then for $X^{\varepsilon}\ll H\ll X^{1-\varepsilon}$ and for any $A\geq 1$, $$ \sum_{f\in \mathcal{H}_k}ω_f\sum_{1\leq |h|\leq H}\bigg| \sum_{\substack{X<n,\: m \leq 2X \\ n - m = h}} λ_f(n)Λ(n)λ_f(m)Λ(m) \bigg|^2 \ll_{A}\frac{HX^2}{(\log X)^{A}},$$ where $\mathcal{H}_k$ is the Hecke basis for the space of holomorphic cusp forms of weight $k$ for the full modular group $\mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$ and $ω_f$ are harmonic weights associated with $f\in \mathcal{H}_k$. These results may be viewed as modular analogues of the averaged forms of the Hardy--Littlewood prime tuple conjecture.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Thomas Creutzig, Vladimir Kovalchuk, Andrew R. Linshaw &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Major revision. Some errors corrected, Theorem 6.3 is new and is used to streamline the proof of Theorem 7.2

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The universal $2$-parameter vertex algebra $W_{\infty}$ of type $W(2,3,4,\dots)$ serves as a classifying object for vertex algebras of type $W(2,3,\dots,N)$ for some $N$ in the sense that under mild hypothesis, all such vertex algebras arise as quotients of $W_{\infty}$. There is an $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ family of such $1$-parameter vertex algebras which, after tensoring with a Heisenberg algebra, are known as $Y$-algebras. They were introduced by Gaiotto and Rapčák and are expected to be the building blocks for all $W$-algebras in type $A$, i.e., every $W$-(super) algebra in type $A$ is an extension of a tensor product of finitely many $Y$-algebras. Similarly, the orthosymplectic $Y$-algebras are $1$-parameter quotients of a universal $2$-parameter vertex algebra $W^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$ of type $W(2,4,6,\dots)$, which is a classifying object for vertex algebras of type $W(2,4,\dots, 2N)$ for some $N$. Unlike type $A$, these algebras are not all the building blocks for $W$-algebras of types $B$, $C$, and $D$. In this paper, we construct a new universal $2$-parameter vertex algebra of type $W(1^3, 2, 3^3, 4, 5^3,6,\dots)$ which we denote by $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ since it contains a copy of the affine vertex algebra $V^k(\mathfrak{sp}_2)$. We identify $8$ infinite families of $1$-parameter quotients of $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ which are analogues of the $Y$-algebras. We regard $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ as a fundamental object on equal footing with $W_{\infty}$ and $W^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$, and we give some heuristic reasons for why we expect the $1$-parameter quotients of these three objects to be the building blocks for all $W$-algebras of classical types. Finally, we prove that $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ has many quotients which are strongly rational. This yields new examples of strongly rational $W$-superalgebras.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01890v6'>2003.01890</a>\]&nbsp; **On Mochizuki's idea of Anabelomorphy and its applications**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kirti Joshi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Changes: 74 pages. Revision, reorganization (proofs are cleaned up and trimmed), some additions (e.g. §6.7, and some new questions included)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>I coined the term anabelomorphy (pronounced as anabel-o-morphy) as a concise way of expressing Mochizuki's idea of "anabelian way of changing ground field, rings etc." which was he has introduced in his work on his Inter-Universal Teichmuller Theory. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of this idea by studying its ramifications in the more familiar arithmetic contexts such as the theory of Galois representations, automorphic forms and related areas and establish a number of results which are of independent arithmetic interest. I also introduce the notion of anabelomorphically connected number fields in which two number fields are related by the existence of topological isomorphism between the local Galois groups at a finite list of primes of both the number fields and prove some results illustrating arithmetic consequences of this notion. The Introduction provides a detailed discussion and summary of all the results proved in this paper.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 43 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We initiate a program aimed at classifying thick ideals, Balmer spectra, and submodule categories of various stable categories of bimodules and modules for finite dimensional selfinjective algebras, and at clarifying the relationship between the universal Balmer support and the Hochschild cohomology support. In this paper, we focus mostly on the case of a unipotent Hopf algebra $A$. The stable category $\underline{\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\mathsf{env}})$ of $A$-bimodules that are projective as left and as right $A$-modules is a monoidal triangulated category under $\otimes_A$, and acts naturally on the stable category $\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A)$ of $A$. We show in this case that the Balmer spectrum $\mathsf{Spc}(\mathcal{E})$ of the thick subcategory ${\mathcal E}$ of $\underline{\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\mathsf{env}})$ generated by $A$ is homeomorphic to $\mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A))$ and defines an embedding $\mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A)) \to \mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A^{\mathsf{env}}))$. Subject to a conjectural description of spectra of finite tensor categories, we show that the spectrum of ${\mathcal E}$ is homeomorphic to ${\mathsf{Proj}}$ of the Hochschild cohomology ring of $A$, and that the Hochschild support coincides with the universal Balmer support. We show that any subcategory ${\mathcal K}$ of $\underline{\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\mathsf{env}})$ containing a thick generator admits a surjective continuous map from $\mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A))$. As a consequence, under the aforementioned conjecture, this spectrum is Noetherian, classifies the thick ideals of ${\mathcal K}$, and classifies thick ${\mathcal K}$-submodule categories of $\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A)$ via the Stevenson module-theoretic support. As examples, we present in detail the representations of finite $p$-groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Inspired by Etingof--Varchenko's dynamical fusion, dynamical $R$-matrix, and dynamical Weyl group for Lie algebras, we introduce, for split symmetric pairs, versions of dynamical fusion, dynamical $K$-matrix, and dynamical Weyl group. We then turn to the study of $(\mathfrak{so}_{2n},O_m)$-duality and prove that the standard Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov and dynamical operators (both differential and difference) on the $\mathfrak{so}_{2n}$-side are exchanged with the symmetric pair analogs, for $O_m\subset GL_m$, on the $O_m$-side.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jeremy Booher, Jack Hsieh, Rakesh Rivera, Vincent Tran, James Upton, Carol Wu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** started as a project for PROMYS 2023. Minor edits, 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Booher, Cais, Kramer-Miller and Upton study a class of $\mathbf{Z}_p$-tower of curves in characteristic $p$ with ramification controlled by an integer $d$. In the special case that $d$ divides $p-1$, they prove a formula for the higher $a$-numbers of these curves involving the number of lattice points in a complicated region of the plane. Booher and Cais had previously conjectured that for $n$ sufficiently large the higher $a$-numbers of the $n$th curve are given by formulae of the form $α(n) p^{2n} + β(n) p^n + λ_r(n) n + ν(n) $ for $n$ sufficiently large, where $α,β,ν,λ_r$ are periodic functions of $n$. This is an example of a new kind of Iwasawa theory. We establish this conjecture by carefully studying these lattice points.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 57 pages. Version 3: strengthens the statement of Theorem 3 and fixed minor typos

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a complex reductive group $G$ and a $G$-representation $\mathbf{N}$, there is an associated Coulomb branch algebra $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^\hbar$ defined by Braverman, Finkelberg and Nakajima. In this paper, we provide a new interpretation of $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^\hbar$ as the largest subspace of the equivariant Borel--Moore homology of the affine Grassmannian on which shift operators (and their deformations induced by flavour symmetries) are defined without localizations. The proofs of the main theorems involve showing that the defining equations of the Coulomb branch algebras reflect the properness of moduli spaces required for defining shift operators. As a main application, we give a very general definition of shift operators, and show that if $X$ is a smooth semiprojective variety equipped with a $G$-action, and $f \colon X \to \mathbf{N}$ is a $G$-equivariant proper holomorphic map, then the equivariant big quantum cohomology $QH^\bullet_G(X)$ defines a family of closed Lagrangians in the Coulomb branch $\mathrm{Spec}\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}$, yielding a transformation of 3d branes in 3d mirror symmetry. We further apply our construction to recover Teleman's gluing formula for Coulomb branches and to derive new generalizations of the Peterson isomorphism.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zachary Porat &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 12 pages; final version, to appear in Mathematics of Computation

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Ash, Grayson, and Green [J. Number Theory 19 (1984), pp. 412-436] compute the action of Hecke operators on a certain subspace of the cohomology of low-level congruence subgroups of $\mathsf{SL}(3, \mathbb{Z})$. This subspace contains the cuspidal cohomology, which is of primary interest. We extend their work, introducing a method that allows for computing the action of Hecke operators directly on the cuspidal cohomology. Using this method, we obtain data for prime level less than 3500, finding seven additional levels at which nonzero cuspidal classes appear and calculating local factors for five of these levels.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Additional results concerning associated polynomials, as well as Hecke operators and their eigenvalues, have been included. Furthermore, the notion of being holomorphic at infinity for a quasi-modular function is discussed in detail

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the structure of the vector space of Drinfeld quasi-modular forms for congruence subgroups. We provide representations as polynomials in the false Eisenstein series with coefficients in the space of Drinfeld modular forms (the $E$-expansion), and, whenever possible, as sums of hyperderivatives of Drinfeld modular forms. \\ Moreover, we introduce and study the double-slash operator, and use it to provide a well-posed definition for Hecke operators on Drinfeld quasi-modular forms. We characterize eigenforms and, for the special case of Hecke congruence subgroups $Γ_0(\mathfrak n)$, we give explicit formulas for the Hecke action on $E$-expansions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the generalized Hausdorff dimension of some natural subsets of $k^{-1}(3)$, where $k^{-1}(3)$ consists of the real numbers $x$ for which $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|<\frac{1}{(3+\varepsilon)q^2}$ has infinitely many rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$ for any $\varepsilon<0$ but only finitely many for any $\varepsilon>0$. It is well known that $k^{-1}(3)$ is an uncountable set with Hausdorff dimension zero. Given any dimension function $h$, we determine the exact "cut point" at which the generalized Hausdorff dimension $\mathcal{H}^h(k^{-1}(3))$ drops from infinity to zero. In particular we show that such a measure is always zero or not $σ$--finite, and, as an application, we can classify topologically $k^{-1}(3)$. Moreover, we show that the subset of attainable elements of $k^{-1}(3)$ has the same generalized Hausdorff dimension as $k^{-1}(3)$, but the subset of non--attainable elements of $k^{-1}(3)$ has a "strictly smaller" generalized Hausdorff dimension.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define a functor from the category of Lie conformal algebras to the category of differential Lie coalgebras, which associates to any Lie conformal algebra $L$ a differential Lie coalgebra $L^{\,0}$, defined as the maximal good $\mathbb{C}[\partial]$-submodule of the conformal dual $L^{*c}$. We show that the contravariant functor ${ }^{0}$ is right adjoint to the contravariant functor ${ }^{*c}$. We define the Loc functor from the category of differential Lie coalgebras to the category of locally finite differential Lie coalgebras, associating to any differential Lie coalgebra $M$ the differential Lie coalgebra Loc$(M)$, defined as the largest locally finite differential Lie subcoalgebra of $M$. We prove that for any Lie conformal algebra $L$ that is free as a $\mathbb{C}[\partial]$-module, Loc$(L^{0})$ is the set of conformal linear maps on $L$ whose kernel contains an ideal of $L$ of cofinite rank. In general, $L^{0}$ will not be locally finite, so $\mathrm{Loc}\left(L^{0}\right) \varsubsetneqq L^{0}$. We present an example illustrating this.</p></details>

The main tool is a recent theorem of Ancona on certain rank $2$ motives. These varieties are constructed explicitly through Honda-Tate theory. Moreover, they have Tate classes that are not generated by divisors nor liftable to characteristic zero. Also, we prove a result towards a classification of simple abelian varieties for which the result of Ancona can be applied to. Along the way, we prove results of independent interest about Honda-Tate theory and about multiplicative relations between algebraic integers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 102 pages. Submission includes ancillary data files. v2: Typos corrected. v3: Journal version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Zeta generators are derivations associated with odd Riemann zeta values that act freely on the Lie algebra of the fundamental group of Riemann surfaces with marked points. The genus-zero incarnation of zeta generators are Ihara derivations of certain Lie polynomials in two generators that can be obtained from the Drinfeld associator. We characterize a canonical choice of these polynomials, together with their non-Lie counterparts at even degrees $w\geq 2$, through the action of the dual space of formal and motivic multizeta values. Based on these canonical polynomials, we propose a canonical isomorphism that maps motivic multizeta values into the $f$-alphabet. The canonical Lie polynomials from the genus-zero setup determine canonical zeta generators in genus one that act on the two generators of Enriquez' elliptic associators. Up to a single contribution at fixed degree, the zeta generators in genus one are systematically expanded in terms of Tsunogai's geometric derivations dual to holomorphic Eisenstein series, leading to a wealth of explicit high-order computations. Earlier ambiguities in defining the non-geometric part of genus-one zeta generators are resolved by imposing a new representation-theoretic condition. The tight interplay between zeta generators in genus zero and genus one unravelled in this work connects the construction of single-valued multiple polylogarithms on the sphere with iterated-Eisenstein-integral representations of modular graph forms.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 24 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we construct new Padé approximations for the \emph{product} of binomial functions and powers of logarithmic functions. While several explicit Padé approximants are known for powers of exponential functions, binomial functions, and logarithmic functions individually, an explicit Padé construction for the product of these functions has not yet been directly achieved. Our main result yields arithmetic applications, providing new linear independence measures for linear forms in $(1+α)^{ω_i}\log^{j_i}(1+α)$ for $1 \le i \le m$ and $0 \le j_i \le r_i - 1$, where $0 < m, r_1, \ldots, r_m \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$, $ω_1, \ldots, ω_m \in \mathbb{Q}$, and $0 \le ω_1 < \cdots < ω_m < 1$. These results hold with algebraic coefficients in both the complex and $p$-adic cases. Additionally, we establish that Padé approximation of a single polylogarithm is, in general, perfect.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a mixed-characteristic local field. For an integer $m \geq 0$, we denote by $K^m / K$ the maximal $m$-step solvable extension of $K$, and by $G_K^m$ the maximal $m$-step solvable quotient of the absolute Galois group $G_K$ of $K$. We regard $G_K$ and its quotients as filtered profinite groups via the respective upper-numbering ramification filtrations. It is known from the previous result due to Mochizuki that the isomorphism class of $K$ is determined by the isomorphism class of the filtered profinite group $G_K$. In this paper, we prove that the isomorphism class of $K$ is determined by the isomorphism class of the maximal $2$-step solvable quotient $G_K^2$ as a filtered profinite group, and furthermore, that $K^m / K$ is determined functorially by the filtered profinite group $G_K^{m + 2}$ (resp. $G_K^{m + 3}$) for $m \geq 2$ (resp. $m = 0, 1$).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) allows a dealer to share a secret among a set of shareholders so that the secret can be reconstructed later from any set of qualified participants. In addition, any public verifier should be able to check the correctness of the sharing and reconstruction process. PVSS has been demonstrated to yield various applications, such as e-voting, distributed key generation, decentralized random number generation protocols, and multi-party computation. Although many concrete PVSS protocols have been proposed, their security is either proven in the random oracle model or relies on quantum-vulnerable assumptions such as factoring or discrete logarithm. In this work, we put forward a generic construction for PVSS that can be instantiated in the standard model under the Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption. Our instantiation provides the first post-quantum PVSS in the standard model, with a reasonable level of asymptotic efficiency.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the Quot and finitized Coh zeta functions of the inert quadratic orders $\mathbb{F}_q[[T]]+T^{m}\mathbb{F}_{q^{2}}[[T]]$ for every $m\geq 1$ in terms of a $2m$-fold multisum, and then show this multisum equals an $m$-fold Bressoud sum. This proves a recent conjecture of the second author, rounding up the line of exploration in the series of work by the authors and Jiang. The equality between the $2m$-fold multisum and the $m$-fold Bressoud sum is built upon generalizing the multisum by introducing a ``ghost'' parameter $a$ to its summands. We then show that such an $a$-generalization is surprisingly $a$-independent by purely $q$-theoretic techniques. Finally, we propose a refined multisum that interpolates two versions of Quot zeta functions for all three types of quadratic orders.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $Π$ be a regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic representation (RACAR) of $\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Q}})$. When $Π$ is $p$-nearly-ordinary for the maximal standard parabolic with Levi $\mathrm{GL}_1 \times \mathrm{GL}_2$, we construct a $p$-adic $L$-function for $Π$. More precisely, we construct a (single) bounded measure $L_p(Π)$ on $\mathbb{Z}_p^\times$ attached to $Π$, and show it interpolates all the critical values $L(Π\timesη,-j)$ at $p$ in the left-half of the critical strip for $Π$ (for varying $η$ and $j$). This proves conjectures of Coates-Perrin-Riou and Panchishkin in this case. We also prove a corresponding result in the right half of the critical strip, assuming near-ordinarity for the other maximal standard parabolic. Our construction uses the theory of spherical varieties to build a "Betti Euler system", a norm-compatible system of classes in the Betti cohomology of a locally symmetric space for $\mathrm{GL}_3$. We work in arbitrary cohomological weight, allow arbitrary ramification at $p$ along the Levi factor of the standard parabolic, and make no self-duality assumption. We thus give the first constructions of $p$-adic $L$-functions for RACARs of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Q}})$ of 'general type' (i.e., those that do not arise as functorial lifts) for any $n > 2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a new technique to study the distribution in residue classes of sets of integers with digit and sum-of-digits restrictions. From our main theorem, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for integers with missing digits to be uniformly distributed in arithmetic progressions, extending previous results going back to the work of Erdős, Mauduit and Sárközy. Our approach utilizes Markov chains and does not rely on Fourier analysis as many results of this nature do. Our results apply more generally to the class of multiplicatively invariant sets of integers. This class, defined by Glasscock, Moreira and Richter using symbolic dynamics, is an integer analogue to fractal sets and includes all missing digits sets. We address uniform distribution in this setting, partially answering an open question posed by the same authors.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A filtration of the morphisms of the $k$-linearization $k \mathbf{FS}$ of the category $\mathbf{FS}$ of finite sets and surjections is constructed using a natural $k \mathbf{FI}^{op}$-module structure induced by restriction, where $\mathbf{FI}$ is the category of finite sets and injections. In particular, this yields the `primitive' subcategory $ k \mathbf{FS}^0 \subset k \mathbf{FS}$ that is of independent interest; for example, the category of $k \mathbf{FS}^0$-modules is closely related to the category of $k \mathbf{FA}$-modules, where $\mathbf{FA}$ is the category of finite sets and all maps. Working over a field of characteristic zero, the subquotients of this filtration are identified as bimodules over $k \mathbf{FB}$, where $\mathbf{FB}$ is the category of finite sets and bijections, also exhibiting and exploiting additional structure. In particular, this describes the underlying $k \mathbf{FB}$-bimodule of $k \mathbf{FS}^0$.</p></details>

We prove that for any infinite subset $\mathcal{S}\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q[x]$, for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$, and for any dimension $m$, the probability distribution functions of both these random variables are equal to one another. This is significantly stronger than the real setting, where Balazard and Martin proved that these functions have asymptotically close averages, when there are no restrictions on the denominators.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Based on the fact that every finite-dimensional algebra over a field is isomorphic to the centralizer of \textbf{two} matrices, we approach the representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras over fields by centralizers of matrices. The first fundamental question is to study the centralizer of a single matrix, called a centralizer matrix algebra. By introducing three new equivalence relations on all square matrices over a field, we completely characterize Morita, derived and almost $ν$-stable derived equivalences between centralizer matrix algebras in terms of these matrix equivalences, respectively. Further, we show that a derived equivalence between centralizer matrix algebras of permutation matrices induces both a Morita equivalence and additional derived equivalences for $p$-regular parts and for $p$-singular parts. As an application, we show that the finitistic dimension conjecture and the Nakayama conjecture are valid for centralizer matrix algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The VC-dimension, introduced by Vapnik and Chervonenkis in 1968 in the context of learning theory, has in recent years provided a rich source of problems in combinatorial geometry. Given $E\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$ or $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, finding lower bounds on the VC-dimension of hypothesis classes defined by geometric objects such as spheres and hyperplanes is equivalent to constructing appropriate geometric configurations in $E$. The complexity of these configurations increases exponentially with the VC-dimension. These questions are related to the Erdős distance problem and the Falconer problem when considering a hypothesis class defined by spheres. In particular, the Erdős distance problem over finite fields is equivalent to showing that the VC-dimension of translates of a sphere of radius $t$ is at least one for all nonzero $t\in \mathbb{F}_q$. In this paper, we show that many of the existing techniques for distance problems over finite fields can be extended to a much broader context, not relying on the specific geometry of circles and spheres. We provide a unified framework which allows us to simultaneously study highly structured sets such as algebraic curves, as well as random sets.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an algebraic Hecke character defined on a CM field $F$ of degree $2d$, Katz constructed a $p$-adic $L$-function of $d+1+δ_{F,p}$ variables in his innovative paper published in 1978, where $δ_{F,p}$ denotes the Leopoldt defect for $F$ and $p$. In the present article, we generalise the result of Katz under several technical conditions (containing the absolute unramifiedness of $F$ at $p$), and construct a $p$-adic Artin $L$-function of $d+1+δ_{F,p}$ variables, which interpolates critical values of the Artin $L$-function associated to a $p$-unramified Artin representation of the absolute Galois group $G_F$. Our construction is an analogue over a CM field of Greenberg's construction over a totally real field, but there appear new difficulties which do not matter in Greenberg's case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this note, we provide three new, very short proofs of two interesting congruences for Merca's partition function $a(n)$, which enumerates integer partitions where the odd parts have multiplicity at most 2. These modulo 2 congruences were first shown elementarily by Sellers. We then frame $a(n)$ into the much broader context of eta-quotients, and suggest how to comprehensively describe its parity behavior. In particular, extensive computations suggest that $a(n)$ is odd precisely 25\% of the time.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties in the fully Hodge-Newton decomposable (or minute) case are the only larger class of ADLVs which could be described completely in the past. Instances of them play important roles in arithmetic geometry, from Harris-Taylor's proof of the local Langlands correspondence to applications in the Kudla program. We study generalizations for many of the equivalent conditions characterizing them to obtain in this way a larger class of ADLVs that still have a similarly good and computable description of their geometry. To generalize the minute condition itself, we introduce the notion of depth for a Shimura datum - the minute cases being those of depth bounded by 1, the cases we study being the ones of depth less than 2.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study in detail the hyperbolic covers $\tilde{W}$ and $\hat{W}$ of an elliptic Weyl system introduced by Saito. We show that they are isomorphic and also isomorphic to an extended Coxeter system of star type. For $\tilde{c}$ a Coxeter transformation in $\tilde{W}$ we can conclude the Hurwitz transitivity of the braid group action on the set of reduced reflection factorizations of $\tilde{c}$ from the Hurwitz transitivity in extended Coxeter systems of star type. This then enables us to establish for a weighted projective line $\mathbb{X}$ of tubular type an order preserving bijection between the poset of thick subcategories of $\mathrm{coh}(\mathbb{X})$ generated by an exceptional sequence and the poset $[\mathrm{id}, \tilde{c}]$ ordered by the absolute order. In an Appendix, we study the hyperbolic cover of a Coxeter system.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A famous conjecture of Keating and Snaith asserts that central values of $L$-functions in a given family admit a log-normal distribution with a prescribed mean and variance depending on the symmetry type of the family. Based on a recent work of Radziwill and Soundararajan, we obtain a conditional lower bound towards Keating-Snaith's conjecture for a "thin" family of cubic Hecke $L$-functions over the Eisenstein field. A key new input is certain twisted estimates of the 1-level density of zeros of cubic Hecke $L$-functions, extending the previous work of David and Güloğlu, under the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In many proofs of Fermat's Two Squares Theorem, the smallest least residue solution $x_0$ of the quadratic congruence $x^2 \equiv -1 \bmod p$ plays an essential role; here $p$ is prime and $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$. Such an $x_0$ is called a Størmer number, named after the Norwegian mathematician and astronomer Carl Størmer (1874-1957). In this paper, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for $x_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ to be a Størmer number of some prime $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$. Størmer's main interest in his investigations of Størmer numbers stemmed from his study of identities expressing $π$ as finite linear combinations of certain values of the Gregory-MacLaurin series for $\arctan(1/x)$. Since less than 600 digits of $π$ were known by 1900, approximating $π$ was an important topic. One such identity, discovered by Størmer in 1896, was used by Yasumasa Kanada and his team in 2002 to obtain 1.24 trillion digits of $π$. We also discuss Størmer's work on connecting these numbers to Gregory numbers and approximations of $π$. \u</p></details>

Tracking these categories under derived autoequivalences and the McKay correspondence, we show that (1) every point in Bridgeland's space of stability conditions on the resolution arises from a Kleinian orbifold, and (2) every positive half of the affine Yangian can be recovered from the COHA associated to some such stability condition. This provides the first example of a family of (pointwise) COHAs defined over the space of stability conditions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 2}$. By $P(n)$ we denote the set of all prime divisors of the integers in the sequence $n, n^2-1, (n^2-1)^2-1, \dots$. We ask whether the set $P(n)$ determines $n$ uniquely under the assumption that $n \neq m^2-1$ for $m \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 2}$. This problem originates in the structure theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras. We show that the sets $P(n)$ generate infinitely many equivalence classes of positive integers under the equivalence relation $n_1 \sim n_2 \iff P(n_1) = P(n_2)$. We also prove that the sets $P(n)$ separate all positive integers up to $2^{29}$, and we provide some heuristics on why the answer to our question should be positive.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $C$ be a curve of genus $g \geq 2$, and let $J$ be its Jacobian. The choice of a degree 1 divisor $e$ on $C$ gives an embedding of $C$ into $J$; we denote by $[C]_{}^{e}\in \mathrm{CH}\left( J;\mathbb{Q} \right) $ the class in the Chow group of $J$ defined by its image. It is known that the vanishing of the Ceresa cycle $\mathrm{Cer}(C,e):=[C]^{e} - [-1]_* [C]^e$ is equivalent to both the vanishing of the 1st Beauville component $[C]_{(1)}^e$ and the vanishing of the 3rd Gross--Kudla--Schoen modified diagonal cycle $Γ^3(C,e) \in \mathrm{CH}(C^3;\mathbb{Q})$. We extend this result to show that the vanishing of the $s$-th Beauville component $[C]^e_{(s)}$ for $s \geq 1$ is equivalent to the vanishing of the $(s+2)$-nd modified diagonal cycle $Γ^{s + 2}(C, e) \in \mathrm{CH}(C^{s+2};\mathbb{Q})$. Moreover, we establish "successive vanishing" results for these cycles. We apply our results to study the rational (non)-triviality of $[C]^{e}_{(s)}$ in the special case $s = 2$. Finally in the $s=1$ case, we show an integral refinement to the original statement, relating the order of torsion of $\mathrm{Cer}(C,e) \in \mathrm{CH}(J;\mathbb{Z})$ to that of $Γ^3(C,e) \in \mathrm{CH}(C^3;\mathbb{Z})$.</p></details>

Equivalently, we study holomorphic correspondences that admit an infinite completely invariant set contained in $\mathbb P^1(k)$. We show that if such a set exists, then there is a holomorphic Galois covering $Θ: R_0 \to \mathbb P^1(\mathbb C)$, where $R_0$ has genus zero or one, such that $ P $ and $ Q $ are ``compositional left factors" of $ Θ.$ We also consider a more general equation $ P^{-1}(K_1) = Q^{-1}(K_2),$ where $K_1$ and $K_2$ are infinite subsets of $\mathbb P^1(k)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $Q$ be an arbitrary finite quiver. We use nonabelian stable envelopes to relate representations of the Maulik-Okounkov Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ to representations of the BPS Lie algebra associated to the tripled quiver $\tilde Q$ with its canonical potential. We use this comparison to provide an isomorphism between the Maulik-Okounkov Lie algebra and the BPS Lie algebra. Via this isomorphism we prove Okounkov's conjecture, equating the graded dimensions of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ with the coefficients of Kac polynomials. Via general results regarding cohomological Hall algebras in dimensions two and three we furthermore give a complete description of $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ as a generalised Kac-Moody Lie algebra with Cartan datum given by intersection cohomology of singular Nakajima quiver varieties, and prove a conjecture of Maulik and Okounkov, stating that their Lie algebra is obtained from a Lie algebra defined over the rationals, by extension of scalars. Finally, we explain how our results suggest the correct definition of critical stable envelopes in vanishing cycle cohomology.</p></details>

For sums of length $\sqrt{c}$, our method produces a non-trivial bound for all moduli except near-primes, saving $c^{-1/12}$ for products of two primes of the same size. Combining this with previous results for prime moduli, we achieve savings beyond the Pólya-Vinogradov range for all moduli. We give applications to moments of twisted cuspidal $L$-functions, and to large sieve inequalities for exceptional cusp forms with composite levels.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 36 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $R$ be a principal ideal local ring of finite length with a finite residue field of odd characteristic. Let $G(R)$ denote either the general linear group or the general unitary group of degree two over $R$. We study the decomposition of tensor products of irreducible representations of $G(R)$. It is known that the irreducible representations of $G(R)$ are built from regular representations, which are classified into three types: cuspidal, split semisimple, and split non-semisimple. We prove that the tensor product of any two regular irreducible representations of distinct types has irreducible constituents with multiplicity at most two. Moreover, we show that the regular part of the tensor product of a cuspidal representation with any other regular representation is multiplicity free. When both factors are of split semisimple type, we show that the multiplicity of any regular irreducible constituent is at most $\mathrm{length}(R) + 1$, and that this bound is achieved only when the constituent is also split semisimple. In contrast, we demonstrate that the multiplicity in the tensor product of two split non-semisimple representations can grow with the cardinality of the residue field when the length of the ring is at least two. In the case when $R$ is a finite field, all such tensor product multiplicities are uniformly bounded above by two. This highlights a significant difference between the behaviour of tensor products in the field case and in the more general finite local ring setting.</p></details>

A single Cauchy--difference--quotient composition identity expresses all $β=1,4$ blocks in terms of the projection kernel and bounded rational multipliers. From these formulas we give short steepest-descent proofs of bulk and edge universality (sine/Airy/Bessel) with uniform error control, an explicit Meixner$\to$Laguerre hard-edge crossover, and a first $A^{-1}$ correction that follows directly from the integrable structure. Finally, we show that Archimedean Kuznetsov tests splice into the Pfaffian kernels by a bounded holomorphic symbol acting in the contour variable; the symbol enters only through the same Cauchy difference--quotient, so the leading sine/Airy/Bessel limits persist and the $A^{-1}$ term again comes from linearizing at the saddle(s).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Partition algebras with non-zero parameters are cellularly stratified and thus have the features of both cellular algebras and stratified algebras. Also, partition algebras form a tower of algebras. In this paper, we provide a diagrammatic approach to study the branching rules for cell modules on a tower of the partition algebras. This also allows us to calculate the structure constants of the Grothendieck ring of the tower.</p></details>

> **Comment:** There is a gap in the proof of the lower bound which we are working on fixing

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F_h(n)$ denote the minimum cardinality of an additive {\em $h$-fold basis} of $\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$: a set $S$ such that any integer in $\{1,2,\cdots, n\}$ can be written as a sum of at most $h$ elements from $S$. While the trivial bounds $h!n \; \lesssim \; F_h(n)^h \; \lesssim \; h^h n$ are well-known, comparatively little has been established for $h>2$. In this paper, we make significant improvements to both of the best-known bounds on $F_h(n)$ for sufficiently large $h$. For the lower bound, we use a probabilistic approach along with the Berry-Esseen Theorem to improve upon the best-known asymptotic result due to Yu. We also establish the first nontrivial asymptotic upper bound on $F_h(n)$ by leveraging a construction for additive bases of finite cyclic groups due to Jia and Shen. In particular, we show that given any $ε>0$, for sufficiently large $h$, we have $$ \left(\frac{1}{2}-ε\right)h!\sqrt{2πe} n\; \leq \; F_h(n)^h \; \leq \; \left(\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+ε\right)h\right)^h n. $$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a profinite group $G$ and a rigid analytic space $X$, we study when an $\mathcal O_X(X)$-linear representation $V$ of $G$ admits a lattice, i.e. an $\mathcal O_{\mathcal X(\mathcal X)}$-linear model for a suitable formal model $\mathcal X$ of $X$ in the sense of Berthelot. We give a positive answer, under mild assumptions, when $X$ is strictly quasi-Stein. As a consequence, we are able to describe explicit open rational subdomains of $X$ over which $V$ is constant after reduction modulo a power of $p$. We give applications in two different directions. First, we prove explicit results on the reduction modulo powers of $p$ of sheaves of crystalline and semistable representations of fixed weight. Second, we deduce a result on the pseudorepresentation carried by the Coleman--Mazur eigencurve, which can be made explicit whenever equations for a rational subdomain of the eigencurve are given.</p></details>

We show that this family contains infinitely many non-Pólya fields for which the cardinality of the Pólya group is unbounded. We also establish that, assuming Bunyakovsky's conjecture for $E(t)$, this family contains infinitely many Pólya fields. We further show that, for any fixed positive integer $m$, there exist infinitely many blocks of $m$ consecutive fields in this family whose cardinality of the Pólya groups can be made arbitrarily large. Finally, we demonstrate that infinitely many fields in this family are non-monogenic with field index one.</p></details>

Our proof relies on explicit Padé type approximations to solutions of a reducible Jordan-Pochhammer differential equation, which extends the Padé approximations for certain Abelian integrals in \cite{Hermite}. The main novelty of our approach lies in the proof of the non-vanishing of the determinants associated with these Padé type approximants.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Consider the action of a subgroup $G$ of the permutation group on the polynomial ring $S := k[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}]$ via permutations.

In particular, being independent of characteristic, they may be computed using characteristic zero techniques, such as Molien's formula.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a number field. We investigate the Mordell-Weil ranks of Jacobian varieties $J_C$ associated with algebraic curves $C$ of genus $g \geq 1$ defined by affine equations of the form $y^s=x(ax^r+b)$, where $a, b \in k$ ($ab \neq 0$), and $r \geq 1, s \geq 2$ are fixed integers. Assuming the strong version of Lang's conjecture concerning rational points on varieties of general type, we establish that the ranks $r(J_C(k))$ are uniformly bounded as $C$ varies within this family. Our methodology builds upon the geometric approach employed by H. Yamagishi and subsequently adapted by the author for the family $y^s=ax^r+b$. We construct a parameter space $\mathcal{W}_n$ for curves possessing $n+1$ specified rational points and analyze its birational model $\mathcal{X}_n$, a complete intersection variety. The geometric properties of the fibers of $\Xc_n \to \text{Sym}^{n+1}(\mathbb{P}^1)$, specifically their genus and gonality, are studied. Combining these geometric insights with Faltings' theorem, uniformity conjectures stemming from Lang's work, and recent results connecting rank with the number of rational points, we deduce the main boundedness result. In the case of genus one curves $C$, it states that the rank of elliptic curves $y^2=x (x^2+B)$ is uniformly bounded subject to the strong version of Lang's conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod n homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}$. As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod n homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected, area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated, and products of area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically area-minimizing. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we prove the following results: Given the Drinfeld double $\mathcal{A}^{ext}_{Q}$ of the localised preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+}_{Q}$ of quiver type $Q$ with the Cartan elements, there is a $\mathbb{Q}(q,t_e)_{e\in E}$-Hopf algebra isomorphism between $\mathcal{A}^{ext}_{Q}$ and the localised Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop group $U^{MO}_{q}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$ of quiver type $Q$. Moreover, we prove the isomorphism of $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm1},t_{e}^{\pm1}]_{e\in E}$-algebras between the negative half of the integral Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop group $U_{q}^{MO,-,\mathbb{Z}}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$ with the opposite algebra of the integral nilpotent $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+,nilp,\mathbb{Z}}_{Q}$ of the same quiver type $Q$. As a result, one can identify the universal $R$-matrix for the root subalgebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{m},w}$ of the slope subalgebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{m}}$ in $\mathcal{A}^{ext}_{Q}$ with the wall $R$-matrix of the wall subalgebra $U_{q}^{MO}(\mathfrak{g}_{w})$ in $U^{MO}_{q}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$. Moreover, under the integrality conjecture for the integral preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+,\mathbb{Z}}_{Q}$, we prove the isomorphism of $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm1},t_{e}^{\pm1}]_{e\in E}$-algebras between the positive half of the integral Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop group $U_{q}^{MO,+,\mathbb{Z}}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$ with the integral preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+,\mathbb{Z}}_{Q}$ of the same quiver type $Q$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we consider the set of non-normal numbers $\mathcal{N}^c$ and ask if there is a non-empty open interval $I$ and a nowhere constant continuous function $\varphi : I \to \mathbb{R}$ which maps all non-normal numbers to normal numbers, i.e., $\varphi(I \cap \mathcal{N}^c) \subset \mathcal{N}.$ We answer this question negatively. We call a set with this property \textit{super-dense}. The super-density of $\mathcal{N}^c$ illustrates further its topological size or geometric richness. Surprisingly, the measure-theoretically ``larger" set of normal numbers $\mathcal{N}$ does not share this property and we give an explicit Cantor-type construction of a nowhere constant continuous function $\hat{C}$, which maps all normal numbers to non-normal numbers. Our final result discusses the relation between super-density and the Baire categories employing various set-theoretic strategies.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The three-manifold topological invariants $\hat Z$ capture the half-index of the three-dimensional theory with ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ supersymmetry obtained by compactifying the M5 brane theory on the closed three-manifold. In 2019, surprising general relations between the $\hat Z$-invariants, quantum modular forms, and vertex algebras have been proposed. In the meanwhile, an extensive array of examples have been studied, but several important general structural questions remain. First, for many three-manifolds we have seen hints of concrete $\widetilde {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ representations underlying the different $\hat Z$-invariants of the given manifolds. At the same time, these invariants appear to only span a subspace of the representation, and the role of the latter remains mysterious. We elucidate the meaning of the modular group representation, realized as vector-valued quantum modular forms, by first proposing the analogue $\hat Z$-invariants with supersymmetric defects, and subsequently showing that the full vector-valued quantum modular form for $\widetilde {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ is precisely the object capturing all the $\hat Z$-invariants of a given three-manifold, when the newly defined defects $\hat Z$-invariants are included. Second, it was expected that matching radial limits is a key feature of $\hat Z$-invariants when changing the orientation of the plumbed three-manifold, suggesting the relevance of mock modularity. We substantiate the conjecture by providing explicit proposals for such $\hat Z$-invariants for three three-manifolds and verify their mock modularity and limits. Third, we initiate the study of the vertex algebra structure of the mock type invariants by showcasing a systematic way to construct cone vertex operator algebras associated to these mock invariants, which can be viewed as the partner of logarithmic vertex operator algebras in this context.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish power-saving estimates for general bilinear forms with Kloosterman sums modulo arbitrary q, including when both variables are shorter than the Polya-Vinogradov range. As an application, we obtain power-saving asymptotics for the second moment of (holomorphic or Maass) modular L-functions twisted with Dirichlet characters to an arbitrary large admissible modulus q. The bounds obtained are independent of the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture and remove all factorability conditions on q in the work of Blomer, Fouvry, Kowalski, Michel, Milicevic, and Sawin.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study Penrose tilings of the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ and nonperiodic infinite frieze patterns from the point of view of Cohen--Macaulay representation theory: Triangulations of the completed infinity-gon correspond to subcategories of the Frobenius category $\mathcal{C}_2=\mathrm{CM}_{\mathbb{Z}}(\mathbb{C}[x,y]/(x^2))$, the singularity category of the curve singularity of type $A_\infty$. We relate Penrose tilings to certain triangulations of the completed infinity-gon, and thus to the corresponding subcategories of $\mathcal{C}_2$. We then extend the cluster character of Paquette and Yıldırım for a triangulated category modelling said triangulations to our setting. This allows us to define nonperiodic infinite friezes patterns coming from triangulations of the completed infinity-gon and in particular from Penrose tilings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $\vecα=(α_1,\ldots,α_n)\in (0,\infty)^n$, $\vecβ=(β_1,\ldots,β_n)\in (\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\})^n$, $\vec{f}:=(f_1,\ldots, f_n)\in \mathcal{S}^n(\mathbb{R})$ and set $$H_{n,\vecα,\vecβ}(\vec{f})(x):=p.v. \int_{\mathbb{R}} f_1(x+β_1 t^{α_1})\ldots f_n(x+β_n t^{α_n}) \frac{dt}{t}, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}\,,$$ with $\mathcal{M}_{n,\vecα,\vecβ}$ being its maximal operator counterpart. Assume that $1<p_j<\infty$ and $\frac{1}{2}<r<\infty$ satisfy $\sum_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{p_j}=\frac{1}{r}$. Under the \emph{non-resonant} assumption that $\{α_j\}_{j=1}^n$ are pairwise distinct we show that $$\|H_{3,\vecα,\vecβ}(\vec{f})\|_{L^r}\lesssim_{\vecα,\vecβ} \prod_{j=1}^3\|f_j\|_{L^{p_j}}\qquad \textrm{and} \qquad \|\mathcal{M}_{n,\vecα,\vecβ}\|_{L^r}\lesssim_{n,\vecα,\vecβ} \prod_{j=1}^n\|f_j\|_{L^{p_j}} \qquad \forall\:n\geq 2\,.$$ (For the maximal operator the boundedness range can be extended to include the endpoint $\infty$ for both $p_j$ and $r$.)</p></details>
