<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we generalize Andrews' partitions separated by parity to overpartitions in two ways. We investigate the generating functions for 16 overpartition families whose parts are separated by parity, and we prove various $q$-series identities for these functions. These identities include relations to modular forms, $q$-hypergeometric series, and mock modular forms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we study the relation between the universal deformation rings and big Hecke algebras in the residually reducible case. Following the strategy of Skinner-Wiles and Pan's proof of the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture, we prove a pro-modularity result. Based on this result, we also give a conditional big $R=\mathbb{T}$ theorem over some totally real fields, which is a generalization of Deo's result.</p></details>

Our result is a sequel to Pan's work, based on some recent progress on $p$-adic Langlands correspondence, Galois deformation theory and a potential pro-modularity result.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $r,\,f$ be multiplicative functions with $r\geqslant 0$, $f$ is complex valued, $|f|\leqslant r$, and $r$ satisfies some standard growth hypotheses. Let $x$ be large, and assume that, for some real number $\tau$, the quantities $r(p)-\Re\{f(p)/p^{i\tau}\}$ are small in various appropriate average senses over the set of prime numbers not exceeding $x$. We derive from recent effective mean-value estimates an effective comparison theorem between the mean-values of $f$ and of $r$ on the set of integers $\leqslant x$. We also provide effective estimates for certain weighted moments of additive functions and for sifted mean-values of non-negative multiplicative functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Markov numbers, i.e. positive integers appearing in solutions to $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz$, can be viewed as specializations of cluster variables. The second author and Matsushita gave a generalization of the Markov equation, $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k_1yz + k_2xz + k_3xy = (3+k_1+k_2+k_3)xyz$, whose solutions can be viewed as specializations of cluster variables in generalized cluster algebras. We give two families of matrices in $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}[x_1^\pm,x_2^\pm,x_3^\pm])$ associated to these cluster structures. These matrix formulas relate to previous matrices appearing in the context of Markov numbers, including Cohn matrices and generalized Cohn matrices given by the second author, Maruyama, and Sato, as well as matrices appearing in the context of cluster algebras, including matrix formulas given by Kanatarc{\i} O\u{g}uz and Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m. We provide a classification of the two families of matrices and exhibit an explicit family of each. The latter is done by realizing cluster variables in generalized Markov cluster algebras as weight-generating functions of order ideals in certain fence posets which are related to Christoffel words. An interesting observation is that these functions resemble Caldero-Chapoton functions for string modules, and a byproduct of our proofs is a new skein-like formula for such functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a possibly twisted loop group $LG$, and any character sheaf of its Iwahori subgroup, we identify the associated affine Hecke category with a combinatorial category of Soergel bimodules. In fact, we prove such results for affine Hecke categories arising from central extensions of the loop group $LG$. Our results work for mod $\ell$ or integral $\ell$-adic coefficients. As applications, we obtain endoscopic equivalences between affine Hecke categories, including the derived Satake equivalence for metaplectic groups, and a series of conjectures by Gaitsgory in quantum geometric Langlands.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 19 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The signs of Fourier coefficients of certain eta quotients are determined by dissecting expansions for theta functions and by applying a general dissection formula for certain classes of quintuple products. A characterization is given for the coefficient sign patterns for $$ \frac{(q^i;q^i)_{\infty}}{(q^p;q^p)_{\infty}} $$ for integers \( i > 1 \) and primes \( p > 3 \). The sign analysis for this quotient addresses and extends a conjecture of Bringmann et al. for the coefficients of \( (q^2;q^2)_{\infty}(q^5;q^5)_{\infty}^{-1} \). The sign distribution for additional classes of eta quotients is considered. This addresses multiple conjectures posed by Bringmann et al.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16599v1'>2507.16599</a>\]&nbsp; **Trace and Observability Inequalities for Laplace Eigenfunctions on the Torus**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nicolas Burq, Pierre Germain, Massimo Sorella, Hui Zhu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AP &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate trace and observability inequalities for Laplace eigenfunctions on the d-dimensional torus, with respect to arbitrary Borel measures $\mu$. Specifically, we characterize the measures $\mu$ for which the inequalities $$ \int |u|^2 d \mu \lesssim \int |u|^2 d x \quad \text{(trace)}, \qquad \int |u|^2 d \mu \gtrsim \int |u|^2 d x \quad \text{(observability)}$$ hold uniformly for all eigenfunctions $u$ of the Laplacian. Sufficient conditions are derived based on the integrability and regularity of $\mu$, while necessary conditions are formulated in terms of the dimension of the support of the measure. These results generalize classical theorems of Zygmund and Bourgain--Rudnick to higher dimensions. Applications include results in the spirit of Cantor--Lebesgue theorems, constraints on quantum limits, and control theory for the Schr\"odinger equation. Our approach combines several tools: the cluster structure of lattice points on spheres; decoupling estimates; and the construction of eigenfunctions exhibiting strong concentration or vanishing behavior, tailored respectively to the trace and observability inequalities.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** D. V. Osipov &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 53 pages; v3: references added; v4: minor changes; to appear in Proc. Steklov Inst. Math. vol. 330 (2025)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the group $\mathcal G$ which is the semidirect product of the group of analytic functions with values in ${\mathbb C}^*$ on the circle and the group of analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle that preserve the orientation. Then we construct the central extensions of the group $\mathcal G$ by the group ${\mathbb C}^*$. The first central extension, so-called the determinant central extension, is constructed by means of determinants of linear operators acting in infinite-dimensional locally convex topological $\mathbb C$-vector spaces. Other central extensions are constructed by $\cup$-products of group $1$-cocycles with the application to them the map related with algebraic $K$-theory. We prove in the second cohomology group, i.e. modulo of a group $2$-coboundary, the equality of the $12$th power of the $2$-cocycle constructed by the first central extension and the product of integer powers of the $2$-cocycles constructed above by means of $\cup$-products (in multiplicative notation). As an application of this result we obtain the new topological Riemann-Roch theorem for a complex line bundle $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$, where $\pi :M \to B$ is a fibration in oriented circles. More precisely, we prove that in the group $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ the element $12 \, [ {\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is equal to the element $6 \, \pi_* ( c_1(L) \cup c_1(L))$, where $[{\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is the class of the determinant gerbe on $B$ constructed by $L$ and the determinant central extension.</p></details>

> **Comment:** We have corrected a few minor typos and updated two references. This paper will appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We revisit and elucidate the $\widehat{A}$-genus, Hirzebruch's $L$-genus and Witten's $W$-genus, cobordism invariants of special classes of manifolds. After slight modification, involving Hecke's trick, we find that the $\widehat{A}$-genus and $L$-genus arise directly from Jacobi's theta function. For every $k\geq 0,$ we obtain exact formulas for the quasimodular expressions of $\widehat{A}_k$ and $L_k$ as ``traces'' of partition Eisenstein series $$ \widehat{\mathcal{A}}_k(\tau)= \mathrm{Tr}_k(\phi_{\widehat{A}};\tau)\ \ \ \ \ \ {\text {and}}\ \ \ \ \ \ \mathcal{L}_k(\tau)= \mathrm{Tr}_k(\phi_L;\tau), $$ which are easily converted to the original topological expressions. Surprisingly, Ramanujan defined twists of the $\widehat{\mathcal{A}}_k(\tau)$ in his ``lost notebook'' in his study of derivatives of theta functions, decades before Borel and Hirzebruch rediscovered them in the context of spin manifolds. In addition, we show that the nonholomorphic $G_2^{\star}$-completion of the characteristic series of the Witten genus is the Jacobi theta function avatar of the $\widehat{A}$-genus.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Full version of a paper accepted to MFCS 2025

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Expansions of the monadic second-order (MSO) theory of the structure $\langle \mathbb{N} ; < \rangle$ have been a fertile and active area of research ever since the publication of the seminal papers of B\"uchi and Elgot & Rabin on the subject in the 1960s. In the present paper, we establish decidability of the MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N} ; <,P \rangle$, where $P$ ranges over a large class of unary ''dynamical'' predicates, i.e., sets of non-negative values assumed by certain integer linear recurrence sequences. One of our key technical tools is the novel concept of (effective) prodisjunctivity, which we expect may also find independent applications further afield.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 41 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A quasi-hereditary algebra is an algebra equipped with a certain partial order $\unlhd$ on its simple modules. Such a partial order -- called a quasi-hereditary structure -- gives rise to a characteristic tilting module $T_{\unlhd}$ by a classical result due to Ringel. A fundamental question is to determine which tilting modules can be realised as characteristic tilting modules. We answer this question by using the notion of IS-tilting module, which is a pair $(T,\unlhd)$ of a tilting module $T$ and a partial order $\unlhd$ on its direct summands such that iterative idempotent truncation along $\unlhd$ always reveals a simple direct summand. Specifically, we show that a tilting module $T$ is characteristic if, and only if, there is some $\unlhd$ so that $(T,\unlhd)$ is IS-tilting; in which case, we have $T=T_{\unlhd}$. This result enables us to study quasi-hereditary structures using tilting theory. As an application of the above result, we show that, for an algebra $A$, all tilting modules are characteristic if, and only if, $A$ is a quadratic linear Nakayama algebra. Furthermore, for such an $A$, we provide a decomposition of the set of its tilting modules that can be used to derive a recursive formula for enumerating its quasi-hereditary structures. Finally, we describe the quasi-hereditary structures of $A$ via `nodal gluing' and binary tree sequences.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages, no figures, accepted for publication in The Ramanujan Journal (Special Collection in Honor of Krishnaswami Alladi)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the theory of integral weight harmonic Maass forms of manageable growth, two key differential operators, the Bol operator and the shadow operator, play a fundamental role. Harmonic Maass forms of manageable growth canonically split into two parts, and each operator controls one of these parts. A third operator, called the flipping operator, exchanges the role of these two parts. Maass--Poincar\'e series (of parabolic type) form a convenient basis of negative weight harmonic Maass forms of manageable growth, and flipping has the effect of negating an index. Recently, there has been much interest in locally harmonic Maass forms defined by the first author, Kane, and Kohnen. These are lifts of Poincar\'e series of hyperbolic type, and are intimately related to the Shimura and Shintani lifts. In this note, we prove that a similar property holds for the flipping operator applied to these Poincar\'e series.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the unweighted error-sum function $\mathcal{E}(x) \coloneqq \sum_{n \geq 0} ( x- p_n(x)/q_n(x) )$, where $p_n(x)/q_n(x)$ is the $n$th convergent of the continued fraction expansion of $x \in \mathbb{R}$. We prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of $\mathcal{E}$ is exactly $1$. Our proof is number-theoretic in nature and involves M\"obius inversion, summation over coprime convergent denominators, and precise upper bounds derived via continued fraction recurrence relations. As a supplementary result, we rederive the known upper bound of $3/2$ for the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of the relative error-sum function $P(x) \coloneqq \sum_{n \geq 0} (q_n(x)x-p_n(x))$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Uchimura, in 1987, introduced a probability generating function for a random variable $X$ and using properties of this function he discovered an interesting $q$-series identity. He further showed that the $m$-th cumulant with respect to the random variable $X$ is nothing but the generating function for the generalized divisor function $\sigma_{m-1}(n)$. Simon, Crippa, and Collenberg, in 1993, explored the $G_{n,p}$-model of a random acyclic digraph and defined a random variable $\gamma_n^{*}(1)$. Quite interestingly, they found links between limit of its mean and the generating function for the divisor function $d(n)$. Later in 1997, Andrews, Crippa and Simon extended these results using $q$-series techniques. They calculated limit of the mean and variance of the random variable $\gamma_n^{*}(1)$ which correspond to the first and second cumulants. In this paper, we generalize the result of Andrews, Crippa and Simon by calculating limit of the $t$-th cumulant in terms of the generalized divisor function. Furthermore, we also discover limit forms for identities of Uchimura and Dilcher. This provides a fourth side to the Uchimura-Ramanujan-divisor type three way partition identities expounded by the first four authors recently.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a finite abelian $p$-group. We count \'etale $G$-extensions of global rational function fields $\mathbb F_q(T)$ of characteristic $p$ by the degree of what we call their Artin-Schreier conductor. The corresponding (ordinary) generating function turns out to be rational. This gives an exact answer to the counting problem, and seems to beg for a geometric interpretation. This is in contrast with the generating functions for the ordinary conductor (from class field theory) and the discriminant, which in general have no meromorphic continuation to the entire complex plane.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1973, Calder\'{o}n proved that an $m \times 2$ positive semidefinite (psd) biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of squares (sos) of ${3m(m+1) \over 2}$ quadratic forms. Very recently, by applying Hilbert's theorem, we proved that a $2 \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of squares of three quadratic forms. This improved Calder\'{o}n's result for $m=2$, and left the sos rank problem of $m \times 2$ biquadratic forms for $m \ge 3$ to further exploration. In this paper, we show that an $m \times n$ psd biquadratic form with a nontrivial zero {can} be expressed as an $(m-1) \times (n-1) \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic form. Furthermore, we show that an $m \times 2$ positive definite (pd) biquadratic form can be expressed as the sum of a square of a quadratic form, and an $(m-1) \times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic form. Thus, the sos rank problem of $m \times 2$ psd biquadratic forms is reduced to the sos rank problem of an $(m-1) \times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic forms. We then show that an $(m-1) \times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic form has at least two nontrivial zeros, and the discriminent of a $2 \times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic form can be expressed as the sum of the square of three cubic forms.</p></details>

We show that an irreducible discrete series representation of $\mathrm{GL}_n(D)$ is $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$-distinguished only if it is supercuspidal. Here, $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$ is the quaternionic symplectic group. Combined with the recent study on $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$-distinguished supercuspidal representations by S\'echerre and Stevens, this completes the classification of $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$-distinguished discrete series representations, as predicted by D.Prasad.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we elucidate the advantage of examining the connections between Hilbert-Kamke equations and geometric designs, or Chebyshev-type quadrature, for classical orthogonal polynomials. We first establish that if a $5$-design with $6$ rational points for a symmetric classical measure is parametrized by rational functions, then the corresponding measure should be the Chebyshev measure $(1-t^2)^{-1/2}dt/\pi$ on $(-1,1)$. Our proof is based on the collaboration of a certain polynomial identity and some advanced techniques on the computation of the genus of a certain irreducible curve. Next, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of rational $5$-designs for the Chebyshev measure. Moreover, as one of our main theorems, we construct an infinite family of ideal solutions for the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott (PTE) problem by utilizing rational $5$-designs for the Chebyshev measure, and then establish that, up to affine equivalence over $\mathbb{Q}$, such ideal solutions are included in the famous parametric solutions found by Borwein (2002).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Last passage percolation (LPP) in an $n\times n$ lower triangular domain has nice connections with various generalizations of Schur measures. LPP along an anti-diagonal, from $(1,n)$ to $(n,1)$, gives a distribution of a highest column of a random composition with respect to a Demazure measure (a non-symmetric analog of a Schur measure). LPP along a main diagonal, from $(1,1)$ to $(n,n)$, is distributed as a marginal of a Pfaffian Schur process. In the first case we show that the asymptotics for the constant specialization is governed by the GOE Tracy-Widom distribution, in the second case - by the GSE Tracy-Widom distribution. In the latter case we were also able to study the truncated lower triangular case, obtaining an interesting generalization of the GSE Tracy-Widom distribution.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let G be the group of rational points of a connected reductive group over a finite field. Based on work of Lusztig and Yun, we make the Jordan decomposition for irreducible G-representations canonical. It comes in the form of an equivalence between the category of G-representations with a fixed semisimple parameter s and the category of unipotent representations of an endoscopic group of G, enriched with an equivariant structure with respect to the component group of the centralizer of s. Next we generalize these results, replacing the connected reductive group by a smooth group scheme with reductive neutral component. Again we establish canonical equivalences for both the rational and the geometric series of G-representations, in terms of unipotent representations of endoscopic groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a local field of characteristic $p$ and $G$ be a connected reductive group over $F$. Recall that Shalika's germ expansion of orbital integrals of regular semi-simple elements near the identity, when it exists, is a sum indexed by the set of unipotent conjugacy classes in $G(F)$. Observe that if $G=SL(2)$ this set is always compact; it is finite if $p\ne2$ while it is uncountable if $p= 2$. As a consequence, Shalika's germ expansion for elliptic elements does not make sense if $p=2$. On the other hand the endoscopic expansion of elliptic orbital integrals always exists and yields a germ expansion equivalent if $p\ne2$ (up to a Fourier transform) to Shalika's germ expansion but is new if $p=2$. A conjecture for arbitrary groups is stated.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Digital signatures are essential cryptographic tools that provide authentication and integrity in digital communications. However, privacy-sensitive applications, such as e-voting and digital cash, require more restrictive verification models to ensure confidentiality and control. Strong Designated Verifier Signature (SDVS) schemes address this need by enabling the signer to designate a specific verifier, ensuring that only this party can validate the signature. Existing SDVS constructions are primarily based on number-theoretic assumptions and are therefore vulnerable to quantum attacks. Although post-quantum alternatives, particularly those based on lattices, have been proposed, they often entail large key and signature sizes. In this work, we introduce $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$, a novel isogeny-based SDVS scheme that offers a compact, quantum-resistant alternative. Our construction builds on the ideal class group action framework of CSIDH and the signature techniques of CSI-FiSh, and relies on the hardness of the Multi-Target Group Action Inverse Problem (MT-GAIP). $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$ achieves strong security guarantees; namely, Strong Unforgeability under Chosen-Message Attacks (SUF-CMA), Non-Transferability (NT), and Privacy of Signer's Identity (PSI), in the random oracle model. Remarkably, both the keys and signatures in $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$ are of size $\mathcal{O}(\lambda)$, representing a significant improvement over the typical $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^2)$ bounds in existing post-quantum SDVS schemes, thereby making it among the most compact PQC-based SDVS schemes and the only post-quantum secure construction based on isogenies.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let eta(z) be the Dedekind eta function. Newman studied the modularity of eta-quotients, giving necessary and sufficient conditions for a function of the form \prod_{0 < m | N} eta(mz)^{r_m} to be a (weakly) holomorphic modular form of level N. We explain a proof of Newman's theorem, developed while teaching a class for talented high school students at Canada/USA Mathcamp. The key observation is that although Gamma_1(N) is not generated by its upper triangular and lower triangular subgroups, it is generated by those subgroups together with any congruence subgroup. Modularity with respect to some congruence subgroup is established using one simple identity involving the multiplier system of eta(z), whose proof is elementary in the sense that it avoids the use of Dedekind sums.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper defines an asymptotic character map which is a morphism from the Grothendieck group of category $\mathcal{O}$ of an integral filtered quantization to rational functions on the Lie algebra of a torus. We show that the asymptotic character of a module computes the equivariant multiplicity of its characteristic cycle. We then apply this construction to truncated shifted Yangians coming from simple, simply-laced Lie algebras and draw connections with characters of modules over KLR algebras using an equivalence of categories of arXiv:1806.07519. Our main theorem shows how this new formalism gives formulas relating equivariant multiplicities of Mirkovi\'{c}-Vilonen cycles and characters of modules over cyclotomic KLR algebras. We explain how this result provides evidence that the change-of-basis between Lusztig's dual canonical basis and the Mirkovi\'{c}-Vilonen basis of $\mathbb{C}[N]$ is computed by a characteristic cycle map whose domain is category $\mathcal{O}$ for truncated shifted Yangians, implying that the coefficients are non-negative integers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 46 pages, fixed a gap in the proof of Proposition 3.6, using Propositions 2.10 and 2.11

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The descent method is one of the approaches to study the Brauer--Manin obstruction to the local--global principle and to weak approximation on varieties over number fields, by reducing the problem to ``descent varieties''. In recent lecture notes by Wittenberg, he formulated a ``descent conjecture'' for torsors under linear algebraic groups. The present article gives a proof of this conjecture in the case of connected groups, generalizing the toric case from the previous work of Harpaz--Wittenberg. As an application, we deduce directly from Sansuc's work the theorem of Borovoi for homogeneous spaces of connected linear algebraic groups with connected stabilizers. We are also able to reduce the general case to the case of finite (\'etale) torsors. When the set of rational points is replaced by the Chow group of zero-cycles, an analogue of the above conjecture for arbitrary linear algebraic groups is proved.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to better understand a family of linear degenerations of the classical Lagrangian Grassmannians $\Lambda(2n)$. It is the special case for $k=n$ of the varieties $X(k,2n)^{sp}$, introduced in previous joint work with Evgeny Feigin, Martina Lanini and Alexander P\"utz. These varieties are obtained as isotropic subvarieties of a family of quiver Grassmannians $X(n,2n)$, and are acted on by a linear degeneration of the algebraic group $Sp_{2n}$. We prove a conjecture proposed in the paper above for this particular case, which states that the ordering on the set of orbits in $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ given by closure-inclusion coincides with a combinatorially defined order on what are called symplectic $(n,2n)$-juggling patterns, much in the same way that the $Sp_{2n}$ orbits in $\Lambda(2n)$ are parametrized by a type C Weyl group with the Bruhat order. The dimension of such orbits is computed via the combinatorics of bounded affine permutations, and it coincides with the length of some permutation in a Coxeter group of affine type C. Furthermore, the varieties $X(n,2n)$ are GKM, that is, they have trivial cohomology in odd degree and are equipped with the action of an algebraic torus with finitely many fixed points and 1-dimensional orbits. In this paper it is proven that $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ is also GKM.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In previous work we computed the number $C_n(q)$ of ideals of codimension $n$ of the algebra ${\mathbb{F}}_q[x,y,x^{-1}, y^{-1}]$ of two-variable Laurent polynomials over a finite field: it turned out that $C_n(q)$ is a palindromic polynomial of degree $2n$ in $q$, divisible by $(q-1)^2$. The quotient $P_n(q) = C_n(q)/(q-1)^2$ is a palindromic polynomial of degree $2n-2$. For each $n\geq 1$ there is a unique degree $n-1$ polynomial ${\overline{P}}_n(X) \in {\mathbb{Z}}[X]$ such that ${\overline{P}}_n(q+q^{-1}) = P_n(q)/q^{n-1}$. In this note we show that for any integer $N$ the integer value ${\overline{P}}_n(N)$ is close to the value at $N$ of the degree $n-1$ polynomial $F_{n-1}(X) = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \, {\overline{T}}_k(X)$, which is a sum of monic versions ${\overline{T}}_k(X)$ of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. We give a precise formula for ${\overline{P}}_n(X)$ as a linear combination of $F_k(X)$'s, each appearance of the latter being parametrized by an odd divisor of $n$. As a consequence, ${\overline{P}}_n(X) = F_{n-1}(X)$ if and only if $n$ is a power of $2$. We exhibit similar formulas for $C_n(q)$.</p></details>

We hereby prove the two conjectures using the principle of holonomic Ansatz plus the approach of modular reduction for creative telescoping, and hence fill the gap.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages. Add examples in section 4.4. Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we generalize the notion of character for 2-representations of finite 2-groups. The properties of 2-characters bear strong similarities to those classical characters of finite groups, including conjugation invariance, additivity, multiplicativity and orthogonality. With a careful analysis using homotopy fixed points and quotients for categories with 2-group actions, we prove that the category of class functors on a 2-group $\mathcal G$ is equivalent to the Drinfeld center of the 2-group algebra $\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathcal G}$, which categorifies the Fourier transform on finite abelian groups. After transferring the canonical nondegenerate braided monoidal structure from $\mathfrak Z_1(\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathcal G})$, we discover that irreducible 2-characters of $\mathcal G$ coincide with full centers of the corresponding 2-representations, which are in a one-to-one correspondence with Lagrangian algebras in the category of class functors on $\mathcal G$. In particular, the fusion rule of $2\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal G)$ can be calculated from the pointwise product of Lagrangian algebras as class functors. From a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) point of view, the commutative Frobenius algebra structure on a 2-character is induced from a 2D topological sigma-model with target space $\lvert \mathrm{B} \mathcal G \rvert$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Polynomial optimization problems often arise in sequences indexed by dimension, and it is of interest to produce bounds on the optimal values of all problems in the sequence. Examples include certifying inequalities between symmetric functions or graph homomorphism densities that hold over vectors and graphs of all sizes, and computing the value of mean-field games viewed as limits of games with a growing number of players. In this paper, we study such any-dimensional polynomial problems using the theory of representation stability, and we develop a systematic framework to produce hierarchies of bounds for their limiting optimal values in terms of finite-dimensional polynomial optimization problems. Our bounds converge at explicit rates, and they follow as a consequence of new de Finetti-type theorems pertaining to sequences of random arrays projecting onto each other in different ways. The proofs of these theorems are based on applying results from probability to representations of certain categories. We apply our framework to produce new bounds on problems arising in a number of application domains such as mean-field games, extremal graph theory, and symmetric function theory, and we illustrate our methods via numerical experiments.</p></details>

We establish new formulae for the decompositions of the first $p-1$ symmetric powers of the Specht module $S^{(n-1,1)}$ and the irreducible module $D^{(n-1,1)}$ in characteristic $p$ as direct sums of Young permutation modules. As an application of the formulae, we show that these symmetric powers have Specht filtration and find the vertices of their indecomposable summands. Our main tool, constructed in this paper, is a lift of a splitting map of a short exact sequence of certain symmetric powers to a splitting map of a short exact sequence of higher symmetric powers.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>First, we prove an algebraization result for rig-smooth algebras over a general noetherian ring; this positively answers the question raised in [Sta24, Tag 0GAX]. Then we prove a general partial algebraization result in non-archimedean geometry. The result says that we can always algebraize a geometrically reduced affinoid rigid-analytic space in "one direction" in an appropriate sense. As an application of this result, we show the remaining cases of the Artin-Grothendieck Vanishing for affinoid algebras, which were previously conjectured in [BM21, {\S}7]. This allows us to deduce a stronger version of the rigid-analytic Artin-Grothendieck Vanishing Conjecture (see [Han20, Conj. 1.2]) over a field of characteristic 0. Using a completely different set of ideas, we also obtain a weaker version of this conjecture over a field of characteristic p>0.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $G$ a finite group, $k$ a field of prime characteristic $p$, and $S$ a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$, the Sylow permutation module $\mathrm{Ind}^G_S(k)$ plays a role in diverse facets of representation theory and group theory, ranging from Alperin's weight conjecture to statistical considerations of $S$-$S$-double cosets in $G$. The Sylow permutation module breaks up along the block decomposition of the group algebra $kG$, but the resulting block components are not invariant under splendid Morita equivalences. We introduce a summand of the block component, which we call source permutation module, which is shown to be invariant under such equivalences. We investigate general structural properties of the source permutation module and we show that well-known results relating the self-injectivity of the endomorphism algebra of the Sylow permutation to Alperin's weight conjecture carry over to the source permutation module. We calculate this module in various cases, such as certain blocks with cyclic defect group and blocks with a Klein four defect group, and for some blocks of symmetric groups, prompted by a question in a recent paper by Diaconis-Giannelli-Guralnick-Law-Navarro-Sambale-Spink on the self-injectivity of the endomorphism algebra of the Sylow permutation module for symmetric groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a $p$-adic theory of periods for 1-motives, extending the classical theory of complex periods into the non-archimedean setting. For 1-motives with good reduction over $p$-adic local fields, we construct a $p$-adic integration pairing that generalizes the Colmez--Fontaine--Messing theory for abelian varieties. This pairing is bilinear, perfect, Galois-equivariant, and compatible with the Hodge filtration, taking values in a quotient of the de Rham period ring. Building on this construction, we introduce a stratified formalism for $p$-adic periods, defining period spaces at various depths that capture increasingly refined relations among periods, and formulating conjectures that mirror the Grothendieck period conjecture in this new context. The classical period conjecture for 1-motives over $\bar{Q}$, previously resolved via the Huber--Wustholz analytic subgroup theorem, is recovered at depth 1 in our framework. For 1-motives over number fields with good reduction at $p$, we identify canonical $Q$-structures on the $p$-adic realizations arising from rational points of their associated formal $p$-divisible groups. Relative to these structures, we establish the conjectures at depths 1 and 2. A key tool is the development of a $p$-adic analytic subgroup theorem tailored to 1-motives, providing an analogue of Wustholz's classical result. Our work not only yields a $p$-adic counterpart to the Kontsevich--Zagier conjecture for 1-motives but also opens new pathways for the study of linear relations among $p$-adic periods and their transcendence properties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct two representations of the twin group $T_n, n\geq 2$, namely $\eta_1: T_n \rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbb{F}_n)$ and $\eta_2: T_n \rightarrow \text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm 1}])$, where $\mathbb{F}_n$ is a free group with $n$ generators and $t$ is indeterminate. We then analyze some characteristics of these two representations, such as irreducibility and faithfulness. Moreover, we prove that both representations can be extended to the virtual twin group $VT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 2$, and we find their $2$-local extensions. On the other hand, we obtain a different result for the welded twin group $WT_n$. More deeply, we show that $\eta_1$ cannot be extended to $WT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 3$, while $\eta_2$ can be extended to $WT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 2$, and we find its $2$-local extensions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The homology of free Lie algebras with coefficients in tensor products of the adjoint representation working over Q contains important information on the homological properties of polynomial outer functors on free groups. The latter category was introduced in joint work with Vespa, motivated by the study of higher Hochschild homology of wedges of circles. There is a splitting of this homology by polynomial degree (for polynomiality with respect to the generators of the free Lie algebra) and one can consider the polynomial degree relative to the number of tensor factors in the coefficients. It suffices to consider the Lie algebra homology in homological degree one; this vanishes in relative degree 0 and is readily calculated in relative degree 1. This paper calculates the homology in relative degree 2, which presents interesting features. This confirms a conjecture of Gadish and Hainaut.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Daniel Ayomide Olanrewaju &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This research introduces the Theory of Partial Symmetry Enforced Attention Decomposition (PSEAD), a new and rigorous group-theoretic framework designed to seamlessly integrate local symmetry awareness into the core architecture of self-attention mechanisms within Transformer models. We formalize the concept of local permutation subgroup actions on windows of biological data, proving that under such actions, the attention mechanism naturally decomposes into a direct sum of orthogonal irreducible components. Critically, these components are intrinsically aligned with the irreducible representations of the acting permutation subgroup, thereby providing a powerful mathematical basis for disentangling symmetric and asymmetric features. We show that PSEAD offers substantial advantages. These include enhanced generalization capabilities to novel biological motifs exhibiting similar partial symmetries, unprecedented interpretability by allowing direct visualization and analysis of attention contributions from different symmetry channels, and significant computational efficiency gains by focusing representational capacity on relevant symmetric subspaces. Beyond static data analysis, we extend PSEAD's applicability to dynamic biological processes within reinforcement learning paradigms, showcasing its potential to accelerate the discovery and optimization of biologically meaningful policies in complex environments like protein folding and drug discovery. This work lays the groundwork for a new generation of biologically informed, symmetry-aware artificial intelligence models.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a semisimple Lie group $G$ and a self-opposite flag manifold $\mathcal{F}$ of $G$, we establish a necessary condition for an infinite subgroup $H$ of $G$ to preserve a proper domain in $\mathcal{F}$. In the case where $G$ is a Hermitian Lie group of tube type, we introduce and study a notion of causal convexity in the Shilov boundary $\mathbf{Sb}(G)$ of the symmetric space of $G$, inspired by the one already existing in conformal Lorentzian geometry. We show that subgroups $H$ of $G$ that are transverse with respect to a parabolic subgroup of $G$ defining $\mathbf{Sb}(G)$ and that preserve a proper domain in $\mathbf{Sb}(G)$ satisfy a geometric property with respect to this causal convexity, close to the strong projective convex cocompactness defined by Danciger--Gu\'eritaud--Kassel. This result highlights the spatial nature of the dynamics of $H$. We construct Zariski-dense examples of such transverse subgroups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathrm{OD}_{n}$ be the monoid of all order-preserving functions and order-reversing functions on the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. We describe a quiver presentation for the monoid algebra $\Bbbk\mathrm{OD}_{n}$ where $\Bbbk$ is a field whose characteristic is not 2. We show that the quiver consists of two straightline paths, one with $n-1$ vertices and one with $n$ vertices, and that all compositions of consecutive arrows are equal to $0$. As part of the proof we obtain a complete description of all homomorphisms between induced left Sch\"utzenberger modules of $\Bbbk\mathrm{OD}_{n}$. We also define $\mathrm{COD}_{n}$ to be a covering of $\mathrm{OD}_{n}$ with an artificial distinction between order-preserving and order-reversing constant functions. We show that $\mathrm{COD}_{n}\simeq\mathrm{O}_{n}\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ where $\mathrm{O}_{n}$ is the monoid of all order-preserving functions on the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. Moreover, if $\Bbbk$ is a field whose characteristic is not $2$ we prove that $\Bbbk\mathrm{COD}_{n}\simeq\Bbbk\mathrm{O}_{n}\times\Bbbk\mathrm{O}_{n}$. As a corollary, we deduce that the quiver of $\Bbbk\mathrm{COD}_{n}$ consists of two straightline paths with n vertices, and that all compositions of consecutive arrows are equal to $0$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 33 pages, 1 figure. Initial article split in two parts; this part contains the irreducibility of degenerate representations

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper studies the analytic continuation of Liouville eigenstates and shows that they assemble into irreducible highest-weight representations of the Virasoro algebra, for all values of the conformal weights. This builds on previous results from the first author and Guillarmou, Kupiainen, Rhodes & Vargas, where such representations were constructed except for the conformal weight on the Kac table. In order to extend these results to the degenerate weights, we find explicit analytic expressions for the Virasoro descendants and uncover the probabilistic meaning of the Kac table. In the algebraic approach to conformal field theory, the irreducibility is a crucial property that must be satisfied by the representations in the spectrum, and is usually taken as an axiom. Computationally, it leads to the celebrated null-vector (or BPZ) equations for correlation functions and conformal blocks, which are the cornerstone of the integrability of the theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 42 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we prove a quantitative version of the Oppenheim conjecture for indefinite ternary quadratic forms: for any indefinite irrational ternary quadratic form $Q$ that is not extremely well approxiable by rational forms, and for $a<b$ the number of integral vectors of norm at most $T$ satisfying $a<Q(v)<b$ is asymptotically equivalent to $\big(\mathsf{C}_Q(b-a)+\mathsf{I}_{Q}(a,b)\big)T$ as $T$ tends to infinity, where the constant $\mathsf{C}_Q>0$ depends only on $Q$, and the term $\mathsf{I}_{Q}(a,b)T$ accounts for the contribution from rational isotropic lines and degenerate planes. The main technical ingredient is a uniform bound for the $\lambda$-moment of the Margulis $\alpha$-function along expanding translates of a unipotent orbit in $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$, for some $\lambda>1$. To establish this, we introduce a new height function $\widetilde{\alpha}$ on the space of lattices, which captures the failure of the classical Margulis inequality. This moment bound implies equidistribution of such translates with respect to a class of unbounded test functions, including the Siegel transform.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the study of Euclidean lattices, the product of the successive minima is bounded from above and below by explicit quantities. This result is known as Minkowski's second theorem, and can be refined to include Hermite's constant in the upper bound, which measures how short a non-zero vector can be in a given lattice. A version of this result exists in the context of number fields, where lattices are replaced with rigid adelic spaces, and successive minima with the Roy--Thunder minima. In this paper, drawing on the analogy between rank $2$ Euclidean lattices and points in $\mathbb{H}$, we will see an analogy between $2$-dimensional rigid adelic spaces and points in $\mathbb{H}^n$, and use that to translate the Minkowski-type theorem on Roy--Thunder minima into a theorem on the distances to cusps in $\mathbb{H}^n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the weighted multilinear polynomial averages in finite fields. The essential ingredient is the $u^s$-norm control of the corresponding weighted multilinear polynomial averages in finite fields, which is motivated by Ter\"av\"ainen \cite{T24}. As an application, we prove an asymptotic formula for the number of the following multidimensional rational function progressions in the subsets of $\mathbb{F}_p^D$: $$ \textbf{x}, \textbf{x}+ P_1(\varphi(y))v_1,\cdots, \textbf{x}+ P_k(\varphi(y))v_k, $$ where $\mathbb{V}=\{v_1, \cdots, v_{k} \in \mathbb{Z}^D\}$ is a collection of nonzero vectors, $\mathbb{P}= \{P_1, \cdots, P_{k}\in \mathbb{Z}[y]\}$ is a collection of linearly independent polynomials with zero constant terms, and $\varphi(y) \in \mathbb{Q}(y)$ is a nonzero rational function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The well-known sequence $\vartheta_n = \vartheta(p_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \ln p_i= \ln\left([p_n]\#\right)$ exhibits numerous extremely interesting properties. Since $p_n = \exp(\vartheta_n - \vartheta_{n-1})$, it is immediately clear that the two sequences $p_n \longleftrightarrow \vartheta_n$ must ultimately encode exactly the same information. But the sequence $\vartheta_n$, while being extremely closely correlated with the primes, (in fact, $\vartheta_n \sim p_n$), is very much better behaved than the primes themselves. Using numerous suitable extensions of various reasonably standard results, I shall demonstrate that the sequence $\vartheta_n$ satisfies suitably defined $\vartheta$-analogues of the usual Cramer, Andrica, Legendre, Oppermann, Brocard, Firoozbakht, Fourges, Nicholson, and Farhadian conjectures. (So these $\vartheta$-analogues are not conjectures, they are instead theorems.) The crucial key to enabling this pleasant behaviour is the regularity (and relative smallness) of the $\theta$-gaps $\mathfrak{g}_n = \vartheta_{n+1}-\vartheta_n= \ln p_{n+1}$. While superficially these results bear close resemblance to some recently derived results for the averaged primes, $\bar p_n = {1\over n} \sum_{i=1}^n p_i$, both the broad outline and the technical details of the arguments given and proofs presented are quite radically distinct.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate some classes of infinite series involving central binomial coefficients, particularly focusing on those arising from ratios such as $\binom{2n}{n}\binom{4n}{2n}^{-1}$,$\binom{4n}{2n}\binom{2n}{n}^{-1}$ and related expressions. We derive several new explicit identities and closed-form evaluations, building on and refining previous results by Bhandari (2022) and Adegoke et al. (2022).</p></details>
