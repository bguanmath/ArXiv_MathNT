<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\lambda\colon A\rightarrow A^{\vee}$ be a polarization on an abelian variety over a field $k$. If $k$ is not algebraically closed, there might not exist an ample line bundle on $A$ defined over $k$ that represents $\lambda$. To remedy this, Poonen and Stoll have asked the following question: does there exist a line bundle on an $A$-torsor that represents $\lambda$? We give a criterion for the existence of such a torsor and line bundle which only depends on the kernel of $\lambda$. Using this criterion, we show that the answer to the question is yes when the polarization has odd or small even degree. On the other hand, we show that for every $g\geq 7$, there exists a polarized $g$-dimensional abelian variety for which the answer to the question is no.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an irreducible variety $X$ over a field $k$, the degree of irrationality $\mathrm{irr}_k X$ is the minimal degree of a dominant rational map $X \dashrightarrow \mathbb{P}_k^{\mathrm{\dim} X}$. When $X$ is a curve, this is simply the gonality of $X$. We determine the possible degrees of irrationality of del Pezzo surfaces over an assortment of field types: number fields, local fields, finite fields, and arbitrary fields.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This revised version incorporates several significant changes. Sections 3 and 4 have been merged, the main theorem of this sections has been refined, and its proof simplified. In addition, the results concerning representations of types B_\ell, C_\ell, and D_\ell have been substantially modified, improving the precision regarding the primes p (the characteristics) for which our results hold

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a finite classical group of Lie type of rank $\ell$, defined over a field of characteristic $p>2$. In this work, we classify the irreducible representations of $G$ whose dimensions are bounded by a constant proportional to $\ell$, and splits into two cases according to $G$ is of type $A_{\ell}$ or not. Furthermore, we discuss explicit formulas for computing the dimensions of such representations. The motivation for this work arises, in part, from a desire to obtain new results on two classical problems concerning Galois representations: the large image conjecture for automorphic Galois representations and the inverse Galois problem. We conclude the paper by giving some remarks on potential implications in these addresses.</p></details>

> **Comment:** version 2: Minor corrections, fixed a mistake in Example 6.3. version 1: 9 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X=G/P$ be a partial flag variety, where $G$ is a semi-simple, simply connected algebraic group defined over an algebraically closed field $K$ of positive characteristic. Let $\mathsf{F}\colon X\to X$ be the absolute Frobenius morphism. Given a line bundle $\mathscr{L}$ on $X$ and an integer $r\geq1$, we describe all line bundles that are direct summands of the pushforward $\mathsf{F}_{*}^{r}\mathscr{L}$. For $\mathscr{L}$ corresponding to a dominant weight, we also compute, for $r$ sufficiently large, the multiplicity of $\mathscr{O}_{X}$ as a summand of $\mathsf{F}_{*}^{r}\mathscr{L}$. As an application we answer a question of Gros-Kaneda about the multiplcity of $\mathscr{L}(-\rho)$ as a direct summand of $\mathsf{F}_{*}\mathscr{O}_{G/B}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we provide a detailed study on effective versions of the celebrated Bilu's equidistribution theorem for Galois orbits of sequences of points of small height in the $N$-dimensional algebraic torus, identifying the qualitative dependence of the convergence in terms of the regularity of the test functions considered. We develop a general Fourier analysis framework that extends previous results obtained by Petsche (2005), and by D'Andrea, Narv\'aez-Clauss and Sombra (2017).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct new moduli spaces of quiver representations with multiplicities, i.e. over rings of truncated power series. This includes moduli of framed representations and analogues of Nakajima quiver varieties. Our construction relies on tools from relative affine Geometric Invariant Theory for non-reductive groups and new stability conditions for quiver representations with multiplicities. We also study the cohomology of smooth moduli spaces of quiver representations with multiplicities, and show that several of these moduli spaces are cohomologically pure, using torus actions, as is the case for Nakajima quiver varieties.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Piotr Borodako, Adam Sawicki &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any element $g$ of compact reductive group $G$ we investigate the asymptotic behavior of its normalized irreducible character in the high-dimension limit, $\frac{\chi_\lambda(g)}{d_\lambda}$. We show that when $G$ is simple the limit vanishes besides identity element. For semisimple groups one gets the same results under the additional assumption that dimensions of irreducible representations of all simple components are going to infinity. Using the notion of approximate $t$-designs we connect this observations with bounds on the production of quantum randomness in large quantum systems.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tamanna Chatterjee &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 19 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a theory of primitive pairs for $\mathbb{Z}$-graded Lie algebras when the sheaves have coefficients in a field $\Bbbk$ of positive characteristic, providing a graded analogue of the role played by cuspidal pairs in the generalized Springer correspondence. We consider the centralizer $G_0$ of a fixed cocharacter $\chi$ in a connected, reductive, algebraic group $G$ and its action on the eigenspaces $\mathfrak{g}_n$ of $\chi$. Building on the framework of parity sheaves and the Fourier transform established in \cite{Ch,Ch1}, we show that every indecomposable parity sheaf on $\mathfrak{g}_n$ can be expressed as a direct summand of a complex induced from primitive data on a Levi subgroup. This result extends the fact that, in the graded setting, any indecomposable parity sheaf is direct summand of an induced cuspidal datum \cite{Ch}. This confirms the organizing role of primitive pairs in the block decomposition of the category of $G_0$-equivariant parity sheaves on $\mathfrak{g}_n$. We further establish that primitive pairs on the nilpotent cone induce primitive pairs in the graded setting, and we prove that primitivity is preserved under the Fourier--Sato transform. These results reveal a deep compatibility between the geometry of graded Lie algebras and their representation-theoretic structures, forming the foundation for a graded version of the generalized Springer correspondence in positive characteristic.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $U$ be a tensor product of highest weight modules of $GL_n(\mathbb C)$ corresponding to multiples of fundamental weights (i.e. rectangles). We consider three ways to stratify $U^{\otimes k}$ into components: using isotypic components of the cyclic action on tensor factors, using a generalization of the charge statistic, and using certain generalizations of Assaf's dual equivalence graphs. We conjecture that all three ways coincide, and we prove that the latter two ways coincide. The Kirillov-Reshetikhin dual equivalence graphs (KR DEGs) we introduce for this purpose are defined on $0$-weight spaces of tensor products of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals. They generalize Kazhdan-Lusztig dual equivalence graphs (KL DEGs) that previously appeared in the study of Kazhdan-Lusztig cells in affine type A. While the tensor products of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals are connected as affine crystals, the KR DEGs in general are not.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is an open problem in additive number theory to compute and understand the full range of sumset sizes of finite sets of integers, that is, the set $\mathcal{R}_{\mathbf{Z}}(h,k)= \{|hA|:A \subseteq {\mathbf{Z}} \text{ and } |A|=k\}$ for all integers $h \geq 3$ and $k \geq 3$. This paper constructs certain infinite families of finite sets of size $k$ and computes their $h$-fold sumset sizes.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 55 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a crystal base of the negative half of a quantum orthosymplectic superalgebra. It can be viewed as a limit of the crystal bases of $q$-deformed irreducible oscillator representations. We also give a combinatorial description of the embedding from the crystal of a $q$-oscillator representation to that of the negative half subalgebra given in terms of a PBW type basis. It is given as a composition of embeddings into the crystals of intermediate parabolic Verma modules, where the most non-trivial one is from an oscillator module to a maximally parabolic Verma module with respect to a quantum subsuperalgebra for $\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n}$. A new crystal theoretic realization of Burge correspondence of orthosymplectic type plays an important role for the description of this embedding.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Thomas Peirce, Jordan Williamson &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 49pp, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We make a systematic study of duality phenomena in tensor-triangular geometry, generalising and complementing previous results of Balmer--Dell'Ambrogio--Sanders and Dwyer--Greenlees--Iyengar. A key feature of our approach is the use of proxy-smallness to remove assumptions on functors preserving compact objects, and to this end we introduce proxy-small geometric functors and establish their key properties. Given such a functor, we classify the rigid objects in its associated torsion category, giving a new perspective on results of Benson--Iyengar--Krause--Pevtsova. As a consequence, we show that any proxy-small geometric functor satisfies Grothendieck duality on a canonical subcategory of objects, irrespective of whether its right adjoint preserves compact objects. We use this as a tool to classify Matlis dualising objects and to provide a suitable generalisation of the Gorenstein ring spectra of Dwyer--Greenlees--Iyengar in tensor-triangular geometry. We illustrate the framework developed with various examples and applications, showing that it captures Matlis duality and Gorenstein duality in commutative algebra, duality phenomena in chromatic and equivariant stable homotopy theory, and Watanabe's theorem in polynomial invariant theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 86 pages, 11 tables. In this version we correct part (3) of Theorem 8.3

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a complete enumeration of all quotients of genus $0, 1$ and $2$ of the Shimura curves $X_0^D(N)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ by non-trivial subgroups of Atkin--Lehner involutions. For all $1270$ genus $1$ quotients $X$ with $N$ squarefree, we determine the isomorphism class of the Jacobian $X$. For $146$ non-elliptic genus $1$ curves $X$ and for $405$ curves genus $2$ quotients $X$, we provide a defining equation for $X$. A main tool for us is the theory of \v{C}erednik--Drinfeld uniformizations of the curves $X_0^D(N)$, which we implement in wider generality than has previously been done in the literature.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14716v2'>2408.14716</a>\]&nbsp; **Universal Koszul Duality for Kac-Moody Groups**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jens Niklas Eberhardt, Arnaud Eteve &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a monoidal equivalence, called universal Koszul duality, between genuine equivariant K-motives on a Kac-Moody flag variety and constructible monodromic sheaves on its Langlands dual. The equivalence is obtained by a Soergel-theoretic description of both sides which extends results for finite-dimensional flag varieties by Taylor and the first author. Universal Koszul duality bundles together a whole family of equivalences for each point of a maximal torus. At the identity, it recovers an ungraded version of Beilinson-Ginzburg-Soergel's and Bezrukavnikov-Yun's Koszul duality for equivariant and unipotently monodromic sheaves. It also generalizes Soergel-theoretic descriptions for monodromic categories on finite-dimensional flag varieties by Lusztig-Yun, Gouttard and the second author. For affine Kac-Moody groups, our work sheds new light on the conjectured quantum Satake equivalences by Cautis-Kamnitzer and Gaitsgory. On our way, we establish foundations on six functors for reduced K-motives and introduce a formalism of constructible monodromic sheaves.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime $\equiv 3$ mod 4, $p>3$, and suppose that 10 has the order $(p-1)/2$ mod p. Then $1/p$ has a decimal period of length $(p-1)/2$. We express the frequency of each digit $0,\ldots,9$ in this period in terms of the class numbers of two imaginary quadratic number fields. We also exhibit certain analogues of this result, so for the case that 10 is a primitive root mod $p$ and for octal digits of $1/p$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Final version, to appear in Mathematische Annalen

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Northcott and Bogomolov property for special values of Dedekind $\zeta$-functions at real values $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}$. We prove, in particular, that the Bogomolov property is not satisfied when $\sigma \geq \frac{1}{2}$. If $\sigma > 1$, we produce certain families of number fields having arbitrarily large degrees, whose Dedekind $\zeta$-functions $\zeta_K(s)$ attain arbitrarily small values at $s = \sigma$. On the other hand, if $\frac{1}{2} \leq \sigma \leq 1$, we construct suitable families of quadratic number fields, employing either Soundararajan's resonance method, which works when $\frac{1}{2} \leq \sigma < 1$, or results on random Euler products by Granville and Soundararajan, and by Lamzouri, which work when $\frac{1}{2} < \sigma \leq 1$. We complete the study by proving that the Dedekind $\zeta$ function together with the degree satisfies the Northcott property for every complex $s\in{\mathbb{C}}$ such that $\mathrm{Re}(s) <0$, generalizing previous work of G\'en\'ereux and Lal\'in.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We are motivated by a result of Alzer and Luca who presented all the integer solutions to the relations $(k!)^n-k^n=(n!)^k-n^k$ and $(k!)^n+k^n=(n!)^k+n^k$. We modify the equations by considering the double factorial instead and present all integer solutions. We also consider some variations of these equations. Furthermore, we study equations of the form $f(x)=A_1^{n_1}n_1!!\cdots A_r^{n_r}n_r!!$, where $f(x)$ is a rational polynomial, and show that under the ABC conjecture there are only finitely many integer solutions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In arXiv:2503.19532 new examples of ribbon Hopf algebras based on the construction due to Nenciu were presented. This piece serves as a sequel where we study the representation theory of these new examples of ribbon Hopf algebras. We classify indecomposable projective and simple modules, find the Krull-Schmidt decomposition of the adjoint representation of Nenciu algebras, and prove fusion rules between its components. We also comment on the properties of M\"uger centres of their representation categories, in particular that they can be non-semisimple. Finally, we consider a new family of ribbon Hopf algebras over fields of prime characteristic $p>2$ in the context of 4-dimensional TQFTs presented in arXiv:2306.03225 that constitute an improvement over examples given therein, although still seemingly falling short of producing powerful invariants of 4-manifolds.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a reductive group G over a non-archimedean local field, we compare smooth representations over C with smooth representations over Qbar (an algebraic closure of Q). For example, we show that tensoring with C over Qbar preserves irreducibility of representations. We also show that an elliptic G-representation (in the sense of Arthur) can be realized over Qbar if and only if its central character takes values in Qbar. That applies in particular to all essentially square-integrable G-representations. We also study the action of the automorphism group of C/Q on complex G-representations. We prove that the classes of essentially square-integrable representations and of elliptic representations are stable under Aut(C/Q).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Exploiting the symmetry topological field theory/topological order correspondence (SymTFT/TO), together with the higher-categorical structure of 6D N =(2,0) SCFTs, we prove that the total quantum dimension of the relative gaugeable algebra leading to intrinsic non-invertible symmetries between class S theories is greater with respect to the non-intrinsic case. From a higher-categorical perspective, this supports the idea that multiplicity is allowed to exceed unity in some superselection sectors.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the first cohomology group of the symmetric algebra of the universal \'etale $p$-adic local system on the tower of coverings of Drinfeld's $p$-adic half-plane. The result takes a factorized form, using the $p$-adic Langlands correspondence in families over Kisin rings. This work extends the corresponding results of Colmez, Dospinescu, and Niziol for trivial coefficients. It relies on the computation of automorphic multiplicities in the \'etale cohomology group of the local system, done in a previous paper, as well as on the determination of the Kisin rings for the special type as functions on an analytic open subset of the projective line.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we present complete classifications, up to isomorphism, of all two-element dimonoids, all commutative three-element dimonoids, and all abelian three-element dimonoids. We show that, up to isomorphism, there exist exactly 8 two-element dimonoids, of which 3 are commutative. Among these, 4 are abelian, and the remaining nonabelian dimonoids form 2 pairs of dual dimonoids. Furthermore, there are exactly 5 pairwise nonisomorphic trivial dimonoids of order 2. For dimonoids of order 3, we prove that there are precisely 14 pairwise nonisomorphic commutative dimonoids, including 12 trivial dimonoids and a single pair of nonabelian nontrivial dual dimonoids. We also establish that, up to isomorphism, there are 17 abelian dimonoids of order 3, consisting of 12 trivial commutative dimonoids and 5 noncommutative nontrivial ones. In addition, we demonstrate the existence of at least 26 pairwise nonisomorphic nonabelian noncommutative dimonoids of order 3.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a non Archimedean local field, and $G$ be the $F$-points of a connected quasi-split reductive group defined over $F$. In this note we propose a converse theorem statement for generic Langlands parameters of $G$ when the Langlands dual group of $G$ is acceptable. We then prove it when $G$ is $F$-split. We also prove that the statement does not apply to $\mathrm{SO}_{2n}(F)$ for certain choices of $F$, as soon as $n\geq 3$.Then we consider a variant which we prove for $G=\mathrm{G}_2(F)$ and all quasi-split classical groups. When $F$ has characteristic zero and assuming the validity of the Gross-Prasad and Rallis conjecture, this latter variant translates via the generic local Langlands correspondence of Jantzen and Liu, into the usual local converse theorems for classical groups expressed in terms of Shahidi's gamma factors.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the cohomology of a chiral supercharge $Q$ in the $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory at tree level. The cohomology classes correspond one-to-one to the $\frac1{16}$ Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) states at one-loop. We argue that monotone classes on the Coulomb branch respect the S-duality between the theories with $\mathrm{SO}(2N+1)$ and $\mathrm{USp}(2N)$ gauge groups, but find an explicit example of a pair of cohomology classes that "violate" the S-duality in the sense that the tree-level $Q$-cohomologies are not isomorphic between the neighborhoods near the two free points. Within this pair, one is a fortuitous class and the other is a monotone chiral ring element. Assuming the non-perturbative validity of S-duality, our results disprove a long-standing conjecture on the one-loop exactness of the $\frac1{16}$-BPS spectrum (including the $\frac1{8}$-BPS chiral ring spectrum) in the $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. Mathematically, this shows that, the relative Lie algebra cohomology $H^\bullet(\mathfrak{g}[A],\mathfrak{g})$ is generally not graded-isomorphic to $H^\bullet({}^L\mathfrak{g}[A],{}^L\mathfrak{g})$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ and ${}^L\mathfrak{g}$ are a pair of Langlands dual Lie algebras and $A=\mathbb{C}[z^+,z^-]\otimes\Lambda(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider generalisations of the elliptic Calogero--Moser systems associated to complex crystallographic groups in accordance to [1]. In our previous work [2], we proposed these systems as candidates for Seiberg--Witten integrable systems of certain SCFTs. Here we examine that proposal for complex crystallographic groups of rank one. Geometrically, this means considering elliptic curves $T^2$ with $\mathbb{Z}_m$-symmetries, $m=2,3,4,6$, and Poisson deformations of the orbifolds $(T^2\times\mathbb{C})/\mathbb{Z}_m$. The $m=2$ case was studied in [2], while $m=3,4,6$ correspond to Seiberg--Witten integrable systems for the rank 1 Minahan--Nemeshansky SCFTs of type $E_{6,7,8}$. This allows us to describe the corresponding elliptic fibrations and the Seiberg--Witten differential in a compact elegant form. This approach also produces quantum spectral curves for these SCFTs, which are given by Fuchsian ODEs with special properties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Intrinsic volumes are fundamental geometric invariants generalizing volume, surface area, and mean width for convex bodies. We establish a unified Laplace-Grassmannian representation for intrinsic and dual volumes of convex polynomial sublevel sets. More precisely, let $f$ be a convex $d$-homogeneous polynomial of even degree $d \ge 2$ which is positive except at the origin. We show that the intrinsic and dual volumes of the sublevel set $[f \le 1]$ admit Laplace-type integral formulas obtained by averaging the infimal projection and restriction of $f$ over the Grassmannian. This explicit representation yields three main consequences: (1) L\"owner--John-type existence and uniqueness results extending beyond the classical volume case; (2) a block decomposition principle describing factorization of intrinsic volumes under direct-sum splitting; (3) a coordinate-free formulation of Lipschitz-type lattice discrepancy bounds. These formulas enable analytic treatment of a broad class of geometric quantities, providing direct access to variational and arithmetic applications as well as new structural insights.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski-dense subgroup of a reductive group $\mathbf{G}$ defined over a field $F$. Given a finite collection of finite subgroups $H_i$ ($i \in I$) of $\mathbf{G}(F)$ avoiding the center, we establish a criterion to ensure that the set of elements of $\Gamma$ that form a free product with every $H_i$ (the so-called simultaneous ping-pong partners for $H_i$) is both Zariski- and profinitely dense in $\Gamma$. This criterion applies namely to direct products $\mathbf{G}$ of inner $\mathbb{R}$-forms of $\mathrm{(P)GL}_n$, and gives a positive answer to this particular case of a question asked by Bekka, Cowling and de la Harpe. For torsion elements, a complication arises due to the fact that a finite cyclic group can split into a direct product. When $\mathbf{G}$ is the multiplicative group of a semisimple algebra, we also give a more explicit method to obtain free products between two given finite subgroups, via first-order deformations. In the second half, we investigate the case where $\mathbf{G}$ is the multiplicative group of the group algebra $FG$ of a finite group $G$, and $\Gamma$ is the group of units of an order in $FG$. In this regard, we prove that the set of bicylic units that play ping-pong with a given shifted bicyclic unit, is Zariski- and profinitely dense, addressing a long-standing belief in the field of group rings. This result is deduced from the criterion above, combined with sharp existence results for well-behaved irreducible representations of $G$ that are center-preserving on a given subgroup.</p></details>

We prove that under suitable assumptions these Schwartz spaces are naturally a representation of a group that we christen the modulation group. This provides a broad generalization of the defining representation of the metaplectic group. The example of a vector space and the zero locus of a quadric cone in an even number of variables are discussed in detail. In both of these cases the modulation group is closely related to algebraic groups, and we propose a conjectural method of linking modulation groups to ind-algebraic groups in general. At the end of the paper we discuss adelization and the relationship between representations of modulation groups and the Poisson summation conjecture.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Version 2: Includes results on dual invariant

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate structural properties of finite groups that are detected by certain group invariants arising from Dijkgraaf--Witten theory, a topological quantum field theory, in one space and one time dimension. In this setting, each finite group $G$ determines a family of numerical invariants associated with closed orientable surfaces, expressed in terms of the degrees of the complex irreducible characters of $G$. These invariants can be viewed as natural extensions of the commuting probability $d(G)$, which measures the likelihood that two randomly chosen elements of $G$ commute and has been extensively studied in the literature. By analyzing these higher-genus analogues, we establish new quantitative criteria relating the values of these invariants to key structural features of finite groups, such as commutativity, nilpotency, supersolvability and solvability. Our results generalize several classical theorems concerning the commuting probability, thereby linking ideas from finite group theory and topological quantum field theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop representation theory of general linear groups in the category $\text{Ver}_4^+$, the simplest tensor category which is not Frobenius exact. Since $\text{Ver}_4^+$ is a reduction of the category of supervector spaces to characteristic $2$ (by a result of Venkatesh, arXiv:1507.05142), these groups may be viewed as general linear supergroups in characteristic $2$. More precisely, every object in $\text{Ver}_4^+$ has the form $m\mathbf{1}+nP$ where $P$ is the indecomposable projective, and $\text{GL}(m\mathbf{1}+nP)$ is the reduction to characteristic $2$ of $\text{GL}(m+n|n)$. We explicitly describe the irreducible representations of $\text{GL}(P)$ and then use this description to classify the irreducible representations of $\text{GL}(m\mathbf{1}+nP)$ for general $m,n$. We also define some subgroups of $\text{GL}(m\mathbf{1}+nP)$ and classify their irreducible representations. Finally, we conjecture a Steinberg tensor product theorem for $\text{Ver}_4^+$ involving the square of the Frobenius map.</p></details>

This extends Balmer's classification of radical thick tensor ideals to noncommutative tensor-triangular geometry. To achieve this, we utilize the notion of support data for lattices and frames, under which the classification is a consequence of Stone duality. We also give a characterization for when the noncommutative Balmer spectrum behaves as it does in tensor-triangular geometry, that is, when it is a spectral space with quasi-compact opens given by complements of supports, and show that rigid centrally generated monoidal-triangulated categories satisfy this property.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct Grothendieck topologies on the path category of a finite graph, examining both coarse and discrete cases that offer different perspectives on quiver representations. The coarse topology declares each vertex covered by all incoming morphisms, giving the minimal non-trivial Grothendieck topology where sheaves correspond to dual representations via dualization. The discrete topology is the finest possible, forcing sheaves to be locally constant with isomorphic restriction maps. We verify these satisfy Grothendieck's axioms, characterize their sheaf categories, and establish functorial relationships between them. Sheaves on the coarse site arise naturally from quiver representations through dualization, while discrete sheaves correspond to representations of the groupoid completion. This work suggests intermediate topologies could capture subtler representation-theoretic phenomena.</p></details>

Our main results provide improved upper bounds for the Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv constant of rank-two-like $p$-groups, and their direct products with cyclic groups of order coprime to $p$. In particular, we determine the exact value of this constant, and also confirm a conjecture of Gao, for a new infinite family of groups of arbitrarily large rank.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Rooted trees are essential for describing numerical schemes via the so-called B-series. They have also been used extensively in rough analysis for expanding solutions of singular Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs). When one considers scalar-valued equations, the most efficient combinatorial set is multi-indices. In this paper, we investigate the existence of intermediate combinatorial sets that will lie between multi-indices and rooted trees. We provide a negative result stating that there is no combinatorial set encoding elementary differentials in dimension $d\neq 1$, and compatible with the rooted trees and the multi-indices aside from the rooted trees. This does not close the debate of the existence of such combinatorial sets, but it shows that it cannot be obtained via a naive and natural approach.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a problem with three equivalent formulations: describing Gibbs measures for five-vertex model in quadrant; classifying coherent systems on a p-deformation of the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph related to Grothendieck polynomials; finding the Martin boundary for discrete time TASEP with p-geometric jumps. We find a wide family of the Gibbs measures, parameterized by certain analytic functions. A subset of our measures have probabilistic interpretation as interacting particle systems with fixed particles speeds. In contrast to previous related boundary problems, we find that admissible speeds are not arbitrary, but must be larger than $\frac{p}{1-p}$. For this subset we further establish Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem, connecting the fluctuations to families of independent GUE eigenvalues. As a consequence, the measures from the subset are extreme points of the Martin boundary. It remains open whether our list of measures is exhaustive.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we consider recurrence sequences $x_n=\xi_1 \alpha_1^n+\xi_2 \alpha_2^n$ ($n=0,1,\ldots$) with companion polynomial $P(X)$. For example, the sequence $x_n=\xi_1(4+\sqrt{2})^n+\xi_2(4-\sqrt{2})^n$ satisfies the recurrence $x_{n+2}-8x_{n+1}+14x_n=0$ and has companion polynomial $P(X)=X^2-8X+14=(X-4-\sqrt{2})(X-4+\sqrt{2})$. We call $(\xi_1,\xi_2)$ normal with respect to the recurrence relation determined by $P(X)$ when $(x_n)_{n\ge 0}$ is uniformly distributed modulo one. Determining the Borel complexity of the set of normal vectors for a fixed recurrence sequence is unresolved even for most geometric progressions. Under certain assumptions, we prove that the set of normal vectors is $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_3^0$-complete. A special case is the new result that the sets of numbers normal in base $\alpha$, i.e. $\{\xi\in \mathbb{R}\mid (\xi\alpha^n)_{n\geq 0}\mbox{ is u.d. modulo one.} \}$, are $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_3^0$-complete for every real number $\alpha$ with $|\alpha|$ Pisot. We analyze the fractional parts of recurrence sequences in terms of finite words via certain numeration systems. One of the difficulties in proving the main result is that even when recurrence sequences are uniformly distributed modulo one, it is not known what the average frequencies of the digits in the corresponding digital expansions are or if they even must exist.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a new framework for studying the distribution of rational points on DM stacks of positive characteristic. Our primary focus is on wild stacks, which existing frameworks do not address. There was not even a satisfactory notion of heights for such stacks. First, we introduce a new kind of height function that extends the authors' idea from their preceding paper on characteristic-zero stacks. This new height function is more general and flexible than the previous one. Examples of the new height function include discriminants of torsors, minimal discriminants, and conductors of elliptic curves in characteristic three. Next, we formulate a generalization of the Batyrev-Manin conjecture for rational points of DM stacks in positive characteristic relative to this new type of height function. We provide several pieces of evidence for this generalization.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct some Iwahori types, in the sense of Bushnell-Kutzko, for the double cover of an almost simple simply-laced simply-connected Chevalley group $\Gt$ over any $2$-adic field. These types capture the covering group analog of the Bernstein block of unramified principal series. We also prove that the associated Hecke algebra essentially admits an Iwahori-Matsumoto (IM) presentation. The complete presentation is obtained for types $A_{r}$, $D_{2r+1}$, $E_{6}$, $E_{7}$; for the other types, some technical obstacles remain. Those Hecke algebras with the complete IM presentation are isomorphic to Iwahori-Hecke algebras of explicit linear Chevalley groups, giving rise to Shimura correspondences. Along the way, we show that the Iwahori type extends to a hyperspecial maximal compact subgroup $\Kt\subseteq \Gt$. This extension has minimal depth among the genuine $\Kt$-representations and allows us to construct a finite Shimura correspondence, generalizing a result of Savin.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let K be a non-archimedean local field and phi: P^1 -> P^1 a rational endomorphism of degree d >= 2 defined over K. We relate the reduction of phi to the Galois action on its preimage towers by introducing the *orbital colimit* G_{O+(x)} := colim_n Im(rho_{phi^n(x)}), a canonical Galois object encoding the dynamics along a forward orbit. Our main theorem (Theorem 3.1) gives a precise equivalence: phi has *strict good reduction* if and only if there exists a nonempty open set of integral points x in P^1(O_K) whose reductions avoid the reduced postcritical set PC(tilde{phi}), such that the reduced level-1 fibers have degree d and are etale -- equivalently, the associated fiber polynomials have unit leading coefficient and unit discriminant. In particular, for every such x, the extensions K(X_n(x))/K are unramified for all n >= 1. This yields a dynamical Neron--Ogg--Shafarevich criterion in arboreal terms, valid on the natural open locus. We provide complete proofs and explicit examples over Q_p.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Kedlaya proves certain formula describing explicitly the Frobenius structure on a hypergeometric equation. In this paper, we give a generalization of it. In our case, the Frobenius matrix is no longer described by p-adic gamma function, and then we describe it by the p-adic polygamma functions. Since the p-adic polygamma values are linear combinations of p-adic L-values of Dirichlet characters, it turns out that the Frobenius matrix is described by p-adic L-values. Our result has an application to the study on Frobenius on p-adic cohomology. We show that, for a projective smooth family such that the Picard-Fuchs equation is a hypergeometric equation, the Frobenius matrix on the log-crystalline cohomology is described by some values of the logarithmic function and p-adic L-functions of Dirichlet characters.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a new construction of vertex operators of the elliptic quantum toroidal algebra $U_{t_1,t_2,p}(\mathfrak{gl}_{N,tor})$ by combining representations of the algebra and formulas of the elliptic stable envelopes for the $A^{(1)}_{N-1}$ quiver variety ${\cal M}(v,w)$. Compositions of the vertex operators turn out consistent to the shuffle product formula of the elliptic stable envelopes. Their highest to highest expectation values provide K-theoretic vertex functions for ${\cal M}(v,w)$. We also derive exchange relation of the vertex operators and construct a $L$-operator satisfying the $RLL=LLR^*$ relation with $R$ and $R^*$ being elliptic dynamical $R$-matrices defined as transition matrices of the elliptic stable envelopes. Assuming a universal form of $L$ and defining a comultiplication $\Delta$ in terms of it, we show that our vertex operators are intertwining operators of the $U_{t_1,t_2,p}(\mathfrak{gl}_{N,tor})$-modules w.r.t $\Delta$.</p></details>

Using the relation between the trace of Frobenius on an elliptic curve and the Fourier coefficients of the cusp-form part of the theta series corresponding to $Q$, we establish a relation between the number of integer solutions to the equation $Q(\mathbf{x}) = p$ and the number of $\mathbb{F}_p$-rational points on the associated elliptic curve under certain congruence conditions on $p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove explicit Erd\H{o}s--Wintner bounds for Cantor series via a simple trailing-window decomposition. We temporarily discard the last block of digits (the ``window'') and analyze the remaining prefix. The resulting bound has three contributions: (i) a bridge loss from discarding the window; (ii) a variance-type tail for the prefix; and (iii) a regime-dependent smoothing term (Esseen, bounded density, or cancellation of the third cumulant). Optimizing the window length yields rates that are explicit in the sample size. In the fixed-base (q-adic) case we recover Delange's product and obtain effective convergence bounds; the same scheme applies unchanged to Cantor series. We also include a brief guide indicating when each regime is preferable.</p></details>

To better understand the effect of this functor, we explicitly determine the finite induction of irreducible modules for standard subVOAs of the rank-one lattice/affine VOA $V_{A_1}$, as well as the finite induction of irreducible modules over a parabolic-type subVOA $V_P$ of the rank-two lattice/affine VOA $V_{A_2}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper addresses the interactions between three properties that a group algebra or more generally a pointed Hopf algebra may possess: being noetherian, having finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, and satisfying the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence. First it is shown that the second and third of these properties are equivalent for group algebras $kG$ of polycyclic-by-finite groups, and are, in turn, equivalent to $G$ being nilpotent-by-finite. In characteristic $0$, this enables us to extend this equivalence to certain cocommutative Hopf algebras. In sections 3 and 4 of the paper finiteness conditions for group algebras are studied. Thus in $\S$3 we examine when a group algebra satisfies the Goldie conditions, while in the final section we discuss what can be said about a minimal counterexample to the conjecture that if $kG$ is noetherian then $G$ is polycyclic-by-finite.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix a prime $p$ and a cuspidal newform $f$ of level coprime to $p$ with $a_p=0$. Attached to $f$ are signed $p$-adic $L$-functions $L_p^\pm(f)$ and Mazur-Tate elements $\theta_n(f)$, both of which encode arithmetic data about $f$ along the cyclotomic $\mathbf{Z}_p$-extension of $\mathbf{Q}$. We compute the Iwasawa invariants of Mazur-Tate elements in terms of the corresponding invariants of the signed $p$-adic $L$-functions. As corollaries, we determine the $p$-adic valuation of critical values of the $L$-function of $f$, and describe a relation between the Iwasawa invariants of congruent modular forms of weights 2 and $p+1$. Our results provide an asymptotic method for computing the signed Iwasawa invariants attached to newforms of any weight $k\geq 2$ with $a_p=0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let \(K\) be a perfectoid field. We describe all quotient fields of the perfectoid Tate algebra \begin{equation*}T_{n, K}^{\text{perfd}}=K\langle X_{1}^{1/p^{\infty}},\dots, X_{n}^{1/p^{\infty}}\rangle \end{equation*}in any number $n\geq1$ of variables in terms of (completed perfections of) the nonarchimedean fields $K_{r_1,\dots, r_l}$ occuring in Berkovich geometry. We prove that every quotient field \begin{equation*}L=T_{n, K}^{\text{perfd}}/\mathfrak{m}\end{equation*}is a so-called semi-immediate extension of $K_{r_1,\dots, r_l}^{\text{perfd}}$ for some \begin{equation*} l \leq \max(0, n-\text{ht}(\mathfrak{m}^{\flat} \cap (T_{n, K^{\flat}})^{\text{coperf}})-1), \end{equation*}which pins down the value groups and the residue fields of the possible quotient fields $L$. The main ingredient in our proof is a qualitative generalization of Berkovich's classification of points on the nonarchimedean closed unit ball. Namely, we introduce the notion of topologically simple valuations, which generalize type (IV) points in the classification of points on $\text{Spa}(K\langle T\rangle)$. We also consider Abhyankar valuations (i.e., those for which Abhyankar's inequality is an equality), which generalize type (II) and (III) points. We prove that, on an affinoid algebra in the sense of Tate which is not a field, the topologically simple valuations are never Abhyankar, and we derive our result on the perfectoid Tate algebra from this statement. Along the way, we also show that our topologically simple valuations are the same as Pr\"ufer-Manis valuations in the sense of \cite{Knebusch-Zhang}. Finally, we also show that all allowed possibilities for the quotient fields $L$ do indeed occur (i.e., the above bound on $l$ is optimal) by generalizing an example of Gleason in \cite{Gleason22N}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Ruzsa's inequality states that $|A+A+A| \leq |A+A|^{3/2}$ for any finite set $A$ in a commutative group. Ruzsa has constructed examples showing that this inequality is sharp asymptotically, up to a constant factor. We prove an inverse result which says that if $|A+A+A| \geq \frac{1}{M} |A+A|^{3/2}$ for some parameter $M,$ then the set $A$ resembles the sets in Ruzsa's construction. We then construct more families of examples which suggest that our inverse result is likely best possible qualitatively. The method extends to give an inverse result for a higher sumset analogue of Ruzsa's inequality, namely $|(h+1)A| \leq |hA|^{\frac{h+1}{h}}$ for any $h\geq 2.$ We also provide a "99%-stability" version of Ruzsa's inequality, which describes near optimal structures when $M$ is very close to $1.$</p></details>

> **Comment:** Adv. Math. to appear, former title: Fractal counterparts of density combinatorics theorems in continued fractions

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We build a bridge from density combinatorics to dimension theory of continued fractions. We establish a fractal transference principle that transfers common properties of subsets of $\mathbb N$ with positive upper density to properties of subsets of irrationals in $(0,1)$ for which the set $\{a_n(x)\colon n\in\mathbb N\}$ of partial quotients induces an injection $n\in\mathbb N\mapsto a_n(x)\in\mathbb N$. Let $(*)$ be a certain property that holds for any subset of $\mathbb N$ with positive upper density. The principle asserts that for any subset $S$ of $\mathbb N$ with positive upper density, there exists a set $E_S$ of Hausdorff dimension $1/2$ such that the set $\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb N}\bigcap_{x\in E_S}\{a_n(x)\}\cap S$ has the same upper density as that of $S$, and thus inherits property $(*)$. Examples of $(*)$ include the existence of arithmetic progressions of arbitrary lengths and the existence of arbitrary polynomial progressions, known as Szemer\'edi's and Bergelson-Leibman's theorems respectively. In the same spirit, we establish a relativized version of the principle applicable to the primes, to the primes of the form $y^2+z^2+1$, to the sets given by the Piatetski-Shapiro sequences.</p></details>

This generalizes the result of Endo (2011) on the rationality problem for norm one tori. To accomplish it, we introduce a generalization of character groups of multinorm one tori. Moreover, we establish systematic reduction methods originating in work of Endo (2001) for an investigation of the rationality problem for arbitrary multinorm one tori.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The stable category of modules over the algebra of a finite group with coefficients in a field is a compactly generated tensor triangulated category, that has been studied extensively in representation theory. In this paper, we provide a plethora of infinite groups G, for which the category of kG-modules (where k is a commutative coherent ring of finite global dimension) admits a monoidal model structure, in the sense of Hovey, whose associated homotopy category is a compactly generated tensor triangulated category. To that end, we use a technique recently introduced by the authors, which is based on Kropholler's operation LH and the second author's operation {\Phi}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $N$ be a positive integer. For every $d\mid N$ such that $(d,N/d)=1$ there exists an Atkin-Lehner involution $w_d$ of the modular curve $X_0(N)$. The curve $X_0^*(N)$ is a quotient curve of $X_0(N)$ by $B(N)$, the group of all involutions $w_d$. In this paper we determine all quotient curves $X_0^*(N)$ whose $\mathbb C$-gonality is equal to $4$. We also determine all curves $X_0^*(N)$ whose $\mathbb Q$-gonality is equal to $4$ with the exception of level $N=378$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Any $\mathbb{N}$-graded commutative Gorenstein ring $R$ of Krull dimension one with $R_0$ a field admits a standard silting object $V$ in the stable category $\underline{\mathrm{CM}}_0^{\mathbb{Z}}R$, and the object $V$ is tilting if and only if the $a$-invariant $a$ is non-negative, as shown by Buchweitz, the first author, and Yamaura. In this article, under the additional assumption that $R$ is a hypersurface singularity, we prove that endomorphism algebra of $V$ is Iwanaga-Gorenstein of self-injective dimension at most $2$, and we give its explicit presentation in terms of a quiver with relation. In the case of where $a$ is negative, we prove that the dg endomorphism algebra of $V$ is Gorenstein, and we give its explicit presentation in terms of a dg path algebra. We explain our results by several examples including numerical semigroup algebras generated by two elements. Moreover, for each finite and countable Cohen-Macaulay representation type, we include the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the category $\mathrm{CM}_0^{\mathbb{Z}}R$ with the position of the standard silting object. As a step of the proof of our results, we give a characterization of Gorensteinness of homologically finite dg algebras in terms of Serre functors.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the generalized Lebesgue-Ramanujan-Nagell equation $x^2+17^k41^\ell 59^m=2^\delta y^n$ in the unknown integers $x\geq 1, y>1,n\geq 3$ and $k, \ell, m\geq 0$ satisfying $\gcd(x,y)=1$. We first find all the integer solutions of the above equation, and then use this result to determine all the integer solutions of some other Lebesgue-Ramanujan-Nagell type equations. Our method uses the classical results of Bilu, Hanrot and Voutier on existence of primitive divisors of Lehmer sequences in combination with number theoretic arguments and computer search.</p></details>
