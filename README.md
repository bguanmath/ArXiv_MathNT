<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a morphism $f : X \to Y$ of schemes, we give a tropical criterion for which points of $Y$ (valued in a field, discrete valuation ring, number ring, or Dedekind domain) lift to $X$. Our criterion extends the firmaments of Abramovich to a wide range of morphisms, even logarithmic stable maps.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We produce graded monoidal categorifications of the quantum boson algebras in any symmetrizable Kac-Moody type. Our categories are defined in terms of diagrammatic generators and relations and have a faithful 2-representation on Khovanov-Lauda and Rouquier's categorification of the corresponding positive part quantum group. We use our construction to produce interesting bases of the quantum boson algebras and quantum bosonic extensions.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04860v3'>2411.04860</a>\]&nbsp; **Hyperrigidity II: $R$-dilations, ideals and decompositions**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Paweł Pietrzycki, Jan Stochel &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.OA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the hyperrigidity of subsets of unital $C^*$-algebras annihilated by states (or, more generally, by completely positive maps). This is closely related to the concept of rigidity at $0$ introduced by G. Salomon, who studied hyperrigid subsets of Cuntz and Cuntz-Krieger algebras. The absence of the unit in a hyperrigid set allows for the existence of $R$-dilations with non-isometric $R$. The existence of such an $R$-dilation forces the state annihilating the hyperrigid set to be a character. Using a dilation-theoretic approach, we provide multiple equivalent criteria for hyperrigidity involving intertwining relations for representations, valid in both commutative and noncommutative settings. We develop structural models for such dilations via orthogonal decompositions into two or three components, determined by defect operators and generalized eigenspaces associated with underlying representations.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Pramath Anamby, Soumya Das &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Comments are most welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the following statement about any Siegel modular form $F$ of degree $n$ and arbitrary odd level $N$ on the group $\Gamma_1^{(n)}(N)$. Let $A(F,T)$ denote the Fourier coefficients of $F$ and write $T=(T(i,j))$. Suppose that $F$ has a non-zero Fourier coefficient $A(F,T_0)$ such that $(T_0(n,n),N)=1$. Then there exist infinitely many odd and square-free (and thus fundamental) integers $m$ such that $m=\mathrm{discriminant}(T)$ and $A(F,T)\neq 0$. In the case of odd degrees, we prove a stronger result by replacing odd and square-free with odd and prime. We also prove quantitative results towards this. As a consequence, we can show in particular that the statement of the main result in arXiv:2408.03442 about the algebraicity of certain critical values of the spinor $L$-functions of holomorphic newforms (in the ambit of Deligne's conjectures) on congruence subgroups of $\mathrm{GSp}(3)$ is unconditional.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Scott Ahlgren, Cruz Castillo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Ramanujan proved three famous congruences for the partition function modulo 5, 7, and 11. The first author and Boylan proved that these congruences are the only ones of this type. In 1984 Andrews introduced the $m$-colored Frobenius partition functions $c\phi_m$; these are natural higher-level analogues of the partition function which have attracted a great deal of attention in the ensuing decades. For each $m\in \{5, 7, 11\}$ there are two analogues of Ramanujan's congruences for $c\phi_m$, and for these $m$ we prove there are no congruences like Ramanujan's other than these six. Our methods involve a blend of theory and computation with modular forms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a field of prime order $p$ and let $\bar{F}$ denote an algebraic closure of $F$. Then for any finite group $G$ we obtain a well-defined surjective map $\Gamma$ from the set of finitely generated isomorphism types of indecomposable $\bar{F}G$-modules, $(\text{ITI}(\bar{F}G))$ to the corresponding set of $FG$-modules $(\text{ITI}(FG))$ such that if $X$ is a finitely generated indecomposable $\bar{F}G$-module, then $X$ and $\Gamma(X)$ share some important common Green Theory Invariants. We also prove a similar result for simple modules and a formula for the number of isomorphism types of simple $\bar{F}G$-modules.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gunther Cornelissen, David Hokken, Berend Ringeling &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 58 pages, 3 figures (v2: several small corrections based on feedback from readers)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a sequence of cyclotomic integers (Gaussian periods) of particularly small Mahler measure/height. We study the asymptotics of their Mahler measure as a function of their conductor, to find that the growth rate is the (multivariate) Mahler measure of a family of log Calabi-Yau varieties of increasing dimension. In turn, we study the asymptotics of some of these Mahler measures as the dimension increases, as well as properties of the associated algebraic dynamical system. We describe computational experiments that suggest that these cyclotomic integers realise the smallest non-zero logarithmic Mahler measure in the set of algebraic integers with cyclic Galois group of a given odd order. Finally, we discuss some precise conjectures that imply double logarithmic growth for those Mahler measures as a function of that order. The proofs use ideas from the theory of quantitative equidistribution, reflexive polytopes and toric varieties, the theory of random walks, Bessel functions, class field theory, and Linnik's constant.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 6 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide two new proofs of the infinitude of prime numbers, using the additive Ramsey-theoretic result known as Folkman's theorem (alternatively, one can think of these proofs as using Hindman's theorem). This adds to the existing literature deriving the infinitude of primes from Ramsey-type theorems.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05629v2'>2509.05629</a>\]&nbsp; **Diagonal Frobenius Number via Gomory's Relaxation and Discrepancy**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Dmitry Gribanov, Dmitry Malyshev, Panos Pardalos &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** cs.DM &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a matrix $A \in Z^{k \times n}$ of rank $k$, the diagonal Frobenius number $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ is defined as the minimum $t \in Z_{\geq 1}$, such that, for any $b \in \text{span}_{Z}(A)$, the condition \begin{equation*} \exists x \in R_{\geq 0}^n,\, x \geq t \cdot 1 \colon \quad b = A x \end{equation*} implies that \begin{equation*} \exists z \in Z_{\geq 0}^n \colon\quad b = A z. \end{equation*} In this work, we show that \begin{equation*} F_{\text{diag}}(A) = \Delta + O(\log k), \end{equation*} where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum absolute value of $k \times k$ sub-determinants of $A$. From the computational complexity perspective, we show that the integer vector $z$ can be found by a polynomial-time algorithm for some weaker values of $t$ in the described condition. For example, we can choose $t = O( \Delta \cdot \log k)$ or $t = \Delta + O(\sqrt{k} \cdot \log k)$. Additionally, in the assumption that a $2^k$-time preprocessing is allowed or a base $J$ with $|{\det A_{J}}| = \Delta$ is given, we can choose $t = \Delta + O(\log k)$. Finally, we define a more general notion of the diagonal Frobenius number for slacks $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$, which is a generalization of $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ for canonical-form systems, like $A x \leq b$. All the proofs are mainly done with respect to $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$. The proof technique uses some properties of the Gomory's corner polyhedron relaxation and tools from discrepancy theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that there exists a bound $N'_L(W)$ for a positively weighted Coxeter group $(W, S, L)$ of finite rank. In particular, Lusztig's $\boldsymbol{a}$-function of $(W, S, L)$ is bounded.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11841v1'>2509.11841</a>\]&nbsp; **The tame Deligne-Simpson problem**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Cheng Shu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The objective of this article is to prove the necessity statement in Crawley-Boevey's conjectural solution to the (tame) Deligne-Simpson problem. We use the nonabelian Hodge correspondence, variation of parabolic weights and results of Schedler-Tirelli to reduce to simpler situations, where every conjugacy class is semi-simple and the underlying quiver is (1) an affine Dynkin diagram or (2) an affine Dynkin diagram with an extra vertex. In case (1), a nonexistence result of Kostov applies. In case (2), the key step is to show that simple representations, if exist, lie in the same connected component as direct sums of lower dimensional ones.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages; fixed typo in Theorem 2.8

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate Eisenstein discriminants, which are squarefree integers $d \equiv 5 \pmod{8}$ such that the fundamental unit $\varepsilon_d$ of the real quadratic field $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ satisfies $\varepsilon_d \equiv 1 \pmod{2\mathcal{O}_K}$. These discriminants are related to a classical question of Eisenstein and have connections to the class groups of orders in quadratic fields as well as to real cubic fields. We present numerical computations of Eisenstein discriminants up to $10^{11}$, suggesting that their counting function up to $x$ is approximated by $\pi_{\mathcal{E}}(x) \approx \frac{1}{3\pi^2}x - 0.024x^{5/6}$. This supports a conjecture of Stevenhagen while revealing a surprising secondary term, which is similar to (but subtly different from) the secondary term in the counting function of real cubic fields. We include technical details of our computation method, which uses a modified infrastructure approach implemented on GPUs.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages. Comments are welcome. Accepted to Journal of the Instute of Mathemacs of Jussieu

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we prove the following result advocating the importance of monomial quadratic relations between holomorphic CM periods. For any simple CM abelian variety $A$, we can construct a CM abelian variety $B$ such that all non-trivial Hodge relations between the holomorphic periods of the product $A\times B$ are generated by monomial quadratic ones which are also explicit. Moreover, $B$ splits over the Galois closure of the CM field associated with $A$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 62 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The periodic Temperley-Lieb category consists of connectivity diagrams drawn on a ring with $N$ and $N'$ nodes on the outer and inner boundary, respectively. We consider families of modules, namely sequences of modules $\mathsf{M}(N)$ over the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra for varying values of $N$, endowed with an action $\mathsf{M}(N') \to \mathsf{M}(N)$ of the diagrams. Examples of modules that can be organised into families are those arising in the RSOS model and in the XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain, as well as several others constructed from link states. We construct a fusion product which outputs a family of modules from any pair of families. Its definition is inspired from connectivity diagrams drawn on a disc with two holes. It is thus defined in a way to describe intermediate states in lattice correlation functions. We prove that this fusion product is a bifunctor, and that it is distributive, commutative, and associative.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a purely geometric explanation of the coincidence between the Coulomb Branch equations for the 3D GLSM describing the quantum $K$-theory of a flag variety, and the Bethe Ansatz equations of the 5-vertex lattice model. In doing so, we prove two explicit presentations for the quantum $K$-ring of the flag variety, resolving conjectures of Gu-Sharpe-Mihalcea-Xu-Zhang-Zou and Rimanyi-Tarasov-Varchenko. We also prove that the stable map and quasimap $K$-theory of the partial flag varieties are isomorphic, using the work of Koroteev-Pushkar-Smirnov-Zeitlin identifying the latter ring with the Bethe algebra of the 5-vertex lattice model. Our isomorphism gives an additional interpretation of the quantum tautological bundles described in the quasimap ring.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Lorenzo Furio, Davide Lombardo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 32 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent years, significant progress has been made on Mazur's Program B, with many authors beginning a systematic classification of all possible images of $p$-adic Galois representations attached to elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$. Currently, the classification is only complete for $p \in \{2,3,13,17\}$. The main difficulty for other primes arises from the need to understand elliptic curves whose mod-$p^n$ Galois representations are contained in the normaliser of a non-split Cartan subgroup. Equivalently, this amounts to determining the rational points on the modular curves $X_{ns}^+(p^n)$. Here, we consider the case $p=7$ and show that the modular curve $X_{ns}^+(49)$, of genus 69, has no non-CM rational points. To achieve this, we establish a correspondence between the rational points on $X_{ns}^+(49)$ and the primitive integer solutions of the generalised Fermat equation $a^2 + 28b^3 = 27 c^7$, the resolution of which can be reduced to determining the rational points of several genus-three curves. Furthermore, we reduce the complete classification of $7$-adic images to the determination of the rational points of a single plane quartic.</p></details>

Some interesting examples arise as quotients by monomial or binomial ideals or determinantal rings. We also explain a geometric method with a view toward constructing rings with certain singularities.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 8 pages; revised version; the proof of Proposition 3.4 has been simplified; to appear in Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the Schur polynomials in all primitive $n$th roots of unity are $1$, $0$, or $-1$, if $n$ has at most two distinct odd prime factors. This result can be regarded as a generalization of properties of the coefficients of the cyclotomic polynomial and its multiplicative inverse. The key to the proof is the concept of a unimodular system of vectors. Namely, this result can be reduced to the unimodularity of the tensor product of two maximal circuits (here we call a vector system a maximal circuit, if it can be expressed as $B \cup \{ -\sum B \}$ with some basis $B$).</p></details>

We also discuss subnormalisers of unipotent and semisimple elements in connected as well as in disconnected reductive linear algebraic groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any set $A$ of natural numbers with positive upper Banach density and any $k\geq 1$, we show the existence of an infinite set $B\subset{\mathbb N}$ and a shift $t\geq0$ such that $A-t$ contains all sums of $m$ distinct elements from $B$ for all $m\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$. This can be viewed as a density analog of Hindman's finite sums theorem.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article considers the family of elliptic curves given by $E_{p}: y^2=x^3-5px$ and certain conditions on an odd prime $p$. More specifically, we have shown that if $p \equiv 7, 23 \pmod {40}$, then the rank of $E_{p}$ is zero for both $ \mathbb{Q} $ and $ \mathbb{Q}(i) $. Furthermore, if the prime $ p $ is of the form $ 40k_1 + 3 $ or $ 40k_2 + 27$, where $k_1, k_2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $(5k_1+1)$ or $(5k_2 +4)$ are perfect squares, then the given family of elliptic curves has rank one over $\mathbb{Q}$ and rank two over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$. Moreover, if the prime $ p $ is of the form $ 40k_3 + 11 $ or $ 40k_4 + 19$ where $k_3 ~\text{and}~ k_4 \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $(160k_3+49)$ or $(160k_4 + 81) $ are perfect squares, then the given family of elliptic curves has rank at least one over $\mathbb{Q}$ and rank at least two over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove G\"ortz's combinatorial conjecture \cite{Go01} on dual shellability of admissible sets in Iwahori-Weyl groups, proving that the augmented admissible set $\widehat{\mathrm{Adm}}(\mu)$ is dual shellable for any dominant coweight $\mu$. This provides a uniform, elementary approach to establishing Cohen-Macaulayness of the special fibers of the local models with Iwahori level structure for all reductive groups-including residue characteristic $2$ and non-reduced root systems-circumventing geometric methods. Local models, which encode singularities of Shimura varieties and moduli of shtukas, have seen extensive study since their introduction by Rapoport-Zink, with Cohen-Macaulayness remaining a central open problem. While previous work relied on case-specific geometric analyses (e.g., Frobenius splittings \cite{HR23} or compactifications \cite{He13}), our combinatorial proof yields an explicit labeling that constructs the special fiber by sequentially adding irreducible components while preserving Cohen-Macaulayness at each step, a new result even for split groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We will employ the method of contour integration to investigate the parity results of non-embedded cyclotomic multiple $t$-values, which we refer to as cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums. We can provide explicit parity formulas for the linear and quadratic cases of cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums, as well as state a parity theorem for the general case. We also present illustrative examples and corollaries. From this, some parity results for classical cyclotomic multiple $t$-values can be derived. Furthermore, we present several general formulas for cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums with denominators involving arbitrary rational polynomials through residue computations. By evaluating these polynomials and computing residues, many other formulas analogous to cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums can be derived. In particular, we also obtain certain parity results for the cyclotomic versions of multiple $T$-values as defined by Kaneko and Tsumura. Finally, we propose some conjectures and questions regarding the parity of cyclotomic multiple $t$-values and cyclotomic multiple $T$-values.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a bijective correspondence between the set of rigid modules over a gentle algebra and the set of admissible arc systems on the associated coordinated-marked surface. In particular, a maximal rigid module aligns with an equivalence class of admissible $5$-partial triangulations, which is an (admissible) set of simple arcs dissecting the surface into $s$-gons with $3\leqslant s\leqslant 5$. Furthermore, the rank of the maximal rigid module is equal to the rank of the algebra plus the number of internal $4$-gons and $5$-gons in the associated $5$-partial triangulation. Subsequently, these results facilitate an exploration of the higher Auslander-Reiten theory for gentle algebras with global dimension $n$. The $\tau_m$-closures of injective modules are realized as admissible $(m+2)$-partial triangulations, where $\tau_m$ are higher Auslander-Reiten translations with $2\leqslant m \leqslant n$. Finally, we provide a complete classification of gentle algebras that are $\tau_n$-finite or $n$-complete introduced by Iyama [I11].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $J_{1,m}(N)$ be the vector space of Jacobi forms of weight one and index $m$ on $\Gamma_0(N)$. In 1985, Skoruppa proved that $J_{1,m}(1)=0$ for all $m$. In 2007, Ibukiyama and Skoruppa proved that $J_{1,m}(N)=0$ for all $m$ and all squarefree $N$ with $\mathrm{gcd}(m,N)=1$. This paper aims to extend their results. We determine all levels $N$ separately, such that $J_{1,m}(N)=0$ for all $m$; or $J_{1,m}(N)=0$ for all $m$ with $\mathrm{gcd}(m,N)=1$. We also establish explicit dimension formulas of $J_{1,m}(N)$ when $m$ and $N$ are relatively prime or $m$ is squarefree. These results are obtained by refining Skoruppa's method and analyzing local invariants of Weil representations. As applications, we prove the vanishing of Siegel modular forms of degree two and weight one in some cases.</p></details>

We study how the cards need to be prepared in the deck to be dealt in order. The order in which the $N$ cards are prepared defines a permutation. In this work, we analyze general dealing patterns, considering properties of the resulting permutations. We give recursive formulas for these permutations, their inverses, the final dealt card, and the dealing order of the first card. We discuss some particular examples of dealing patterns and conclude with an analysis of several existing and novel magic card tricks making use of dealing patterns. Our discussions involve 30 existing sequences in the OEIS, and we introduce 44 new sequences to that database.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the structural and characterizing properties of the so-called {\it 2-UQ rings}, that are rings such that the square of every unit is the sum of an idempotent and a quasi-nilpotent element that commute with each other. We establish some fundamental connections between 2-UQ rings and relevant widely classes of rings including 2-UJ, 2-UU and tripotent rings. Our novel results include: (1) complete characterizations of 2-UQ group rings, showing that they force underlying groups to be either 2-groups or 3-groups when $3 \in J(R)$; (2) Morita context extensions preserving the 2-UQ property when trace ideals are nilpotent; and (3) the discovery that potent 2-UQ rings are precisely the semi-tripotent rings. Furthermore, we determine how the 2-UQ property interacts with the regularity, cleanness and potent conditions. Likewise, certain examples and counter-examples illuminate the boundaries between 2-UQ rings and their special relatives. These achievements of ours somewhat substantially expand those obtained by Cui-Yin in Commun. Algebra (2020) and by Danchev {\it et al.} in J. Algebra \& Appl. (2025).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\alpha$ be a Steinhaus random multiplicative function. For a wide class of multiplicative functions $f$ we construct a multiplicative chaos measure arising from the Dirichlet series of $\alpha f$, in the whole $L^1$-regime. Our method does not rely on the thick point approach or Gaussian approximation, and uses a modified second moment method with the help of an approximate Girsanov theorem. We also employ the idea of weak convergence in $L^r$ to show that the limiting measure is independent of the choice of the approximation schemes, and this may be seen as a non-Gaussian analogue of Shamov's characterisation of multiplicative chaos. Our class of $f$-s consists of those for which the mean value of $|f(p)|^2$ lies in $(0,1)$. In particular, it includes the indicator of sums of two squares. As an application of our construction, we establish a generalised central limit theorem for the (normalised) sums of $\alpha f$, with random variance determined by the total mass of our measure.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish the limiting distribution of $\frac{{(\log \log x)}^{1/4}}{\sqrt{x}} \sum_{n\le x}\alpha(n)$ where $\alpha$ is a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, answering a question of Harper. The distributional convergence is proved by applying the martingale central limit theorem to a suitably truncated sum. This truncation is inspired by work of Najnudel, Paquette, Simm and Vu on subcritical holomorphic multiplicative chaos setting, but analysed with a different conditioning argument generalised from Harper's work on fractional moments to circumvent integrability issues at criticality. A significant part of the proof is devoted to the convergence in probability of the associated partial Euler product to a critical multiplicative chaos measure, independent of the mild shift away from the critical line. Our approach to the universality of critical non-Gaussian multiplicative chaos bypasses the barrier analysis with the help of a modified second moment method, and employs a novel argument based on coupling and homogenisation by change of measure, which could be of independent interest.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 31pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is natural to consider extending the typical construction of relative Poisson algebras from commutative differential algebras to the context of bialgebras. The known bialgebra structures for relative Poisson algebras, namely relative Poisson bialgebras, are equivalent to Manin triples of relative Poisson algebras with respect to the symmetric bilinear forms which are invariant on both the commutative associative and Lie algebras. However, they are not consistent with commutative and cocommutative differential antisymmetric infinitesimal (ASI) bialgebras as the bialgebra structures for commutative differential algebras. Alternatively, with the invariance replaced by the commutative $2$-cocycles on the Lie algebras, the corresponding Manin triples of relative Poisson algebras are proposed, which are shown to be equivalent to certain bialgebra structures, namely relative PCA bialgebras. They serve as another approach to the bialgebra theory for relative Poisson algebras, which can be naturally constructed from commutative and cocommutative differential ASI bialgebras. The notion of the relative PCA Yang-Baxter equation (RPCA-YBE) in a relative PCA algebra is introduced, whose antisymmetric solutions give coboundary relative PCA bialgebras. The notions of $\mathcal{O}$-operators of relative PCA algebras and relative pre-PCA algebras are also introduced to give antisymmetric solutions of the RPCA-YBE.</p></details>

Leveraging the geometry of the Bruhat--Tits building, the structure of $(\theta,k)$-split tori, and the $K\mathcal{B}_kH_k$ decomposition of $G_k$, we establish that any nontrivial Chabauty limit $L$ of $H_k$ is $G_k$-conjugate to a subgroup of $$U_{\sigma_+}(k) \rtimes (Ker(\alpha)^0 \cdot (H_k \cap M_{\sigma_{\pm}})) \leq P_{\sigma_+}(k),$$ where $\alpha$ is a projection map arising from a Levi factor $M_{\sigma_{\pm}}$ of a parabolic subgroup $P_{\sigma_+} \subset G$, and $Ker(\alpha)^0$ denotes the subgroup of elliptic elements in the kernel of $\alpha$. Our analysis distinguishes between elliptic and hyperbolic elements and constructs explicit unipotent elements in the limit group $L$ using the Moufang property of $G_k$. Furthermore, we show that $L$ acts transitively on the set of ideal simplices opposite to $\sigma_+$. These results yield a detailed description of the Chabauty compactification of $H_k$, and provide new insights into its interaction with the non-Archimedean geometry of $G_k$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper introduces the notion of locally algebraic representations and corresponding sheaves in the context of the cohomology of arithmetic groups. These representations are of relevance for the study of integral structures and special values of cohomological automorphic representations, as well as corresponding period relations. We introduce and investigate related concepts such as locally algebraic $({\mathfrak g},K)$-modules and cohomological types of automorphic representations. Applying the recently developed theory of tdos and twisted $\mathcal D$-modules over schemes by Hayashi and the author, we establish the existence of canonical global $1/N$-integral structures on spaces of automorphic cusp forms. As an application, we define canonical periods attached to regular algebraic automorphic representations, potentially related to the action of Venkatesh's derived Hecke algebra on cuspidal cohomology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Katz and Sarnak conjectured that the behavior of zeros near the central point of any family of $L$-functions is well-modeled by the behavior of eigenvalues near $1$ of some classical compact group (either the symplectic, unitary, or even, odd, or full orthogonal group). In 2018, Knightly and Reno proved that the symmetry group can vary depending on how the $L$-functions in the family are weighted. They observed both orthogonal and symplectic symmetry in the one-level densities of families of cuspidal newform $L$-functions for different choices of weights. We observe the same dependence of symmetry on weights in the $n^{\text{th}}$ centered moments of these one-level densities, for smooth test functions whose Fourier transforms are supported in $\left(-\frac{1}{2n}, \frac{1}{2n}\right)$. To treat the new terms that emerge in our $n$-level calculations when $n>1$, i.e., the cross terms that emerge from $n$-fold products of primes rather than individual primes, we generalize Knightly and Reno's weighted trace formula from primes to arbitrary positive integers. We then perform a delicate analysis of these cross terms to distinguish their contributions to the main and error terms of the $n^{\text{th}}$ centered moments. The final novelty here is an elementary combinatorial trick that we use to rewrite the main number theoretic terms arising from our analysis, facilitating comparisons with random matrix theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The celebrated Artin conjecture on primitive roots asserts that given any integer $g$ which is neither $-1$ nor a perfect square, there is an explicit constant $A(g)>0$ such that the number $\Pi(x;g)$ of primes $p\le x$ for which $g$ is a primitive root is asymptotically $A(g)\pi(x)$ as $x\to\infty$, where $\pi(x)$ counts the number of primes not exceeding $x$. Artin's conjecture has remained unsolved since its formulation in 1927. Nevertheless, Hooley demonstrated in 1967 that Artin's conjecture is a consequence of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) for Dedekind zeta functions of certain cyclotomic-Kummer extensions over $\mathbb{Q}$. In this paper, we use GRH to establish a uniform version of the Artin--Hooley asymptotic formula. Specifically, we prove that $\Pi(x;g) \sim A(g) x/\log{x}$ whenever $\log{x}/\log\log{2|g|} \to \infty$, i.e., whenever $x$ tends to infinity faster than any power of $\log{(2|g|)}$. Under GRH, we also show that the least prime $p_g$ possessing $g$ as a primitive root satisfies the upper bound $p_g=O(\log^{19}(2|g|))$ uniformly for all non-square $g\ne-1$. We conclude with an application to the average value of $p_g$ and a discussion of an analogue concerning the least "almost-primitive'' root.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 61 pages, final version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a construction of "integral local Shimura varieties" which are formal schemes that generalize the well-known integral models of the Drinfeld $p$-adic upper half spaces. The construction applies to all classical groups, at least for odd $p$. These formal schemes also generalize the formal schemes defined by Rapoport-Zink via moduli of $p$-divisible groups, and are characterized purely in group-theoretic terms. More precisely, for a local $p$-adic Shimura datum $(G, b, \mu)$ and a quasi-parahoric group scheme $\mathcal G$ for $G$, Scholze has defined a functor on perfectoid spaces which parametrizes $p$-adic shtukas. He conjectured that this functor is representable by a normal formal scheme which is locally formally of finite type and flat over $O_{\breve E}$. Scholze-Weinstein proved this conjecture when $(G, b, \mu)$ is of (P)EL type by using Rapoport-Zink formal schemes. We prove this conjecture for any $(G, \mu)$ of abelian type when $p\neq 2$, and when $p=2$ and $G$ is of type $A$ or $C$. We also relate the generic fiber of this formal scheme to the local Shimura variety, a rigid-analytic space attached by Scholze to $(G, b, \mu, {\mathcal G})$.</p></details>

Buan and Marsh [4] have introduced the concept of $\tau$-exceptional sequences to generalize the definitions and theorems to all finite dimensional algebras.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the structure of the category of representations of $\mathbf{FA}$, the category of finite sets and all maps, mostly working over a field of characteristic zero. This category is not semi-simple and exhibits interesting features. We first construct the simple representations, recovering the classification given by Wiltshire-Gordon. The construction given here also yields explicit descriptions of the indecomposable projectives. These results are used to give a convenient set of projective generators of the category of representations of $\mathbf{FA}$ and hence a Morita equivalence result. This is used to explain how to calculate the multiplicities of the composition factors of an arbitrary object, based only on its underlying $\mathbf{FB}$-representation, where $\mathbf{FB}$ is the category of finite sets and bijections. This is applied to show how to calculate the morphism spaces between projectives in our chosen set of generators, as well as for a closely related family of objects (the significance of which can be shown by relative nonhomogeneous Koszul duality theory).</p></details>

Singer conjectured that the algebraic transfer is always a monomorphism, but this remains open for all homology degrees $q\geq 5.$ In this paper, by constructing a novel algorithm implemented in the computer algebra system OSCAR for computing $GL(q)$-invariants of the kernel of the Kameko homomorphism, we disprove Singer's conjecture for bidegree $(6, 6+36).$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be an algebraic group over a field $k$, and $M$ and $N$ be $G$-modules. In 1961, Hochschild showed how one can define the cohomology groups $\text{Ext}_{G}^{i}(M,N)$. Kimura, in 1965, showed that one can generalize this to get relative cohomology for algebraic groups. The original cohomology groups play an important role in understanding the representation theory of $G$, but the role of relative cohomology is still not well understood. In this paper the author expands upon the work of Kimura to prove foundational results about the relative cohomology. The author starts by giving the definitions of relative exact sequences and relative injective modules and proves a variety of basic properties for each that will be essential to define relative cohomology and obtain a relative Grothendieck spectral sequence. In particular, the induction functor will play an important role when studying the relative injective modules. Once the necessary ground work is laid, the definition of relative cohomology is given. Finally, it is stated when there is a relative Grothendieck spectral sequence, and many consequences and examples are provided.</p></details>

To prove this, we show a structure theorem on the rational group algebra $\mathbf{Q}[G]$ of ramification groups, refining a theorem of Serre and generalizing results on $p$-groups of Roquette and Ford.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Heegner cycles are higher weight analogues of Heegner points. Their arithmetic intersection numbers also appear as Fourier coefficients of modular forms and often belong to abelian extensions of imaginary-quadratic fields. Rotger and Seveso propose a precise recipe for the $p$-adic Abel-Jacobi images of cycle classes whose existence is predicted by conjectures of Bloch and Beilinson and which would be a real-quadratic analogue to Heegner cycles: the Stark-Heegner cycles of the title. In this paper, we generalize Darmon-Vonk's theory of rigid meromorphic cocycles to higher weight, producing a higher Green's pairing of real-quadratic divisors on the $p$-adic upper half-plane, which seems to be the real-quadratic analogue of the pairing of Heegner cycles. Computation of these values for "principal cycles'' gives evidence that they lie in abelian extensions of real-quadratic fields. The algebraicity of certain values of the higher Green's function is indirect evidence for the existence of algebraic Stark-Heegner cycles.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, the first author with A. Ardehali, M. Lemos, and L. Rastelli introduced the notion of graded unitarity for vertex algebras. This generalization of unitarity is motivated by the SCFT/VOA correspondence and introduces a novel Hilbert space structure on the state space of a large class of vertex algebras that are not unitary in the conventional sense. In this paper, we study the relative semi-infinite cohomology of graded-unitary vertex algebras that admit a chiral quantum moment map for an affine current algebra at twice the critical level. We show that the relative semi-infinite chain complex for such a graded-unitary vertex algebra has a structure analogous to that of differential forms on a compact K\"ahler manifold, generalizing a strong form of the classic construction of Banks--Peskin and Frenkel--Garland--Zuckerman. We deduce that the relative semi-infinite cohomology is itself graded-unitary, which establishes graded unitarity for a large class of vertex operator algebras arising from three- and four-dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theories. We further establish an outer USp$(2)$ action on the semi-infinite cohomology (which does not respect cohomological grading), analogous to the Lefschetz $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ in K\"ahler geometry. We also show that the semi-infinite chain complex is quasi-isomorphic as a differential graded vertex algebra to its cohomology, in analogy to the formality result of Deligne--Griffiths--Morgan--Sullivan for the de Rham cohomology of compact K\"ahler manifolds. We conclude by observing consequences of these results to the associated Poisson vertex algebras and related finite-type derived Poisson reductions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is the second part of a series that intends to study the resolving subcategories for gentle algebras over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{K}$. As in the first part, we continue to focus on gentle quivers $(Q,R)$, where $Q$ is a directed tree, known as gentle trees. In our previous work, via a modified surface model for gentle algebras with finite global dimension, we studied the join-irreducible elements of the lattice of resolving subcategories of $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R \rangle - \text{mod}$, which happen to be those generated by a non-projective indecomposable object. In this paper, we notice that this lattice is not semidistributive in general and, accordingly, introduce a so-called upper join-decomposition, replacing the canonical one. Together with the techniques we develop in our geometric model, it allows us to describe the resolving subcategories of any gentle tree. These same techniques let us explicitly construct the resolving subcategory generated by any collection of indecomposable $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R\rangle$-modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct an explicit field-independent SL$_2$-equivariant isomorphism between an invariant space of tensors and a plethysm space. The existence of such an isomorphism was only known in characteristic 0, and only indirectly via character theory. Our isomorphism naturally extends the web of field-independent isomorphisms given by Hermite reciprocity, Hodge duality, and the Wronskian isomorphism. This is a characteristic free generalization of a classical situation in characteristic zero: certain rectangular Kronecker coefficients coincide with certain plethysm coefficients, and their non-negativiy proves the unimodality of the $q$-binomial coefficient. We also give a short combinatorial field-independent proof that the Hermite reciprocity map over the standard basis is a triangular matrix with 1s on the main diagonal.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An Egyptian fraction is a sum of the form $1/n_1 + \cdots + 1/n_r$ where $n_1, \dots, n_k$ are distinct positive integers. We prove explicit lower bounds for the cardinality of the set $E_N$ of rational numbers that can be represented by Egyptian fractions with denominators not exceeding $N$. More precisely, we show that for every integer $k \geq 4$ such that $\ln_k N \geq 3/2$ it holds $$ \frac{\ln(|E_N|)}{\ln 2} \geq \Big(2 - \frac{3}{\ln_k N}\Big)\frac{N}{\ln N}\prod_{j=3}^{k} \ln_j N , $$ where $\ln_k$ denotes the $k$-th iterate of the natural logarithm. This improves on a previous result of Bleicher and Erd\H{o}s who established a similar bound but under the more stringent condition $\ln_k N\geq k$ and with a leading constant of $1$. Furthermore, we provide some methods to compute the exact values of $|E_N|$ for large positive integers $N$, and we give a table of $|E_N|$ for $N$ up to $154$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the probability that some weighted partial sums of a random multiplicative function $f$ are positive. Applying the characteristic decomposition, we obtain that if $S$ is a non-empty subset of the multiplicative residue class group $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ with $m$ being a fixed positive integer and $A=\{a+mn\mid n=0,1,2,3,\cdots\}$ with $a\in S,$ then there exists a positive number $\delta$ independent of $x$, such that $$ \mathbb{P}\left(\sum_{A\cap[1,x)}\frac{f(n)}{n}<0\right)>\delta $$ unless the coefficients of the real characters in the expansion of the characteristic function of $S$ according to the characters of $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ are all non-negative, and the coefficients of the complex characters are all zero, in which case we have $$ \mathbb{P}\left(\sum_{A\cap[1,x)}\frac{f(n)}{n}<0\right)=O\left(\exp\left(-\exp\left(\frac{\ln x}{C\ln_{2}x}\right)\right)\right) $$ for a positive constant $C.$ This includes as a special case a result of Angelo and Xu. We also extend the result to the cyclotomic field $K_{n}=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{n})$ with $\zeta_{n}=e^{2\pi i/n}$ and study the probability that these generalized weighted sums are positive. In addition, we deal with the positivity problem of certain partial sums related to the celebrated Ramanujan tau function $\tau(n)$ and the Ramanujan modular form $\Delta(q),$ and obtain an upper bound for the probability that these partial sums are negative in a more general situation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The adjunction between coalgebras and Hopf algebras, first described by Takeuchi, allows one to prove that the semi-abelian category of cocommutative Hopf algebras has enough $\mathcal E$-projective objects with respect to the class $\mathcal{E}$ of cleft extensions. One then proves that, for any cocommutative Hopf algebra, there exists a weak $\mathcal{E}$-universal normal (=central) extension. This fact allows one to apply the methods of categorical Galois theory to classify normal $\mathcal{E}$-extensions and to provide an explicit description of the fundamental group of a cocommutative Hopf algebra in terms of a generalized Hopf formula. Moreover, with any cleft extension, we associate a 5-term exact sequence in homology that can be seen as a Hopf-theoretic analogue of the classical Stallings-Stammbach exact sequence in group theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite subset $A$ of a group $G$, we define the right quotient set and the left quotient set of $A$, respectively, as $AA^{-1} := \{a_1a_2^{-1}:a_1,a_2\in A\}$, $A^{-1}A := \{a_1^{-1}a_2:a_1,a_2\in A\}$. While the right and left quotient sets are equal if $G$ is abelian, subtleties arise when $G$ is a nonabelian group, where the cardinality difference $|AA^{-1}| - |A^{-1}A|$ may be take on arbitrarily large values. Using the results of Martin and O'Bryant on the cardinality differences of sum sets and difference sets in $\mathbb{Z}$, we prove in the infinite dihedral group, $D_\infty \cong \mathbb{Z} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, every integer difference is achievable. Further, we prove that in $F_2$, the free group on $2$ generators, an integer difference is achievable if and only if that integer is even, and we explicitly construct subsets of $F_2$ that achieve every even integer. We further determine the minimum cardinality of $A \subset G$ so that the difference between the cardinalities of the left and right quotient sets is nonzero, depending on the existence of order $2$ elements in $G$. To prove these results, we construct difference graphs $D_A$ and $D_{A^{-1}}$ which encode equality, respectively, in the right and left quotient sets. We observe a bijection from edges in $D_A$ to edges in $D_{A^{-1}}$ and count connected components in order to obtain our results on cardinality differences $|AA^{-1}| - |A^{-1}A|$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a rigorous proof of the Gang-Yonekura formula describing the transformation of the 3D index under Dehn filling a cusp in an orientable 3-manifold. The 3D index, originally introduced by Dimofte, Gaiotto and Gukov, is a physically inspired q-series that encodes deep topological and geometric information about cusped 3-manifolds. Building on the interpretation of the 3D index as a generating function over Q-normal surfaces, we introduce a relative version of the index for ideal triangulations with exposed boundary. This notion allows us to formulate a relative Gang-Yonekura formula, which we prove by developing a gluing principle for relative indices and establishing an inductive framework in the case of layered solid tori. Our approach makes use of Garoufalidis-Kashaev's meromorphic extension of the index, along with new identities involving q-hypergeometric functions. As an application, we study the limiting behaviour of the index for large fillings. We also develop code to perform certified computations of the index, guaranteeing correctness up to a specified accuracy. Our extensive computations support the topological invariance of the 3D index and suggest a well-defined extension to closed manifolds.</p></details>

In contrast, Mockenhaupt and Tao proved in the special case $N = p$ the stronger estimate $$\left(\frac{1}{|\Sigma|}\sum\limits_{m\in\Sigma}|\widehat{f}(m)|^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq C N^{-1}\left(\sum\limits_{x\in (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2}|f(x)|^\frac{4}{3}\right)^\frac{3}{4}.$$ We extend the Mockenhaupt-Tao bound to the case of squarefree $N$, proving $$\left(\frac{1}{|\Sigma|}\sum\limits_{m\in\Sigma}|\widehat{f}(m)|^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq C_\epsilon N^\epsilon\cdot N^{-1}\left(\sum\limits_{x\in (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2}|f(x)|^\frac{4}{3}\right)^\frac{3}{4},$$ and discuss applications of this result to uncertainty principles and signal recovery.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is well-known that an averaging operator on a commutative associative algebra gives rise to a perm algebra. This paper lifts this process to the level of bialgebras. For this purpose, we first give an infinitesimal bialgebra structure for averaging commutative associative algebras and characterize it by double constructions of averaging Frobenius commutative algebras. To find the bialgebra counterpart of perm algebras that is induced by such averaging bialgebras, we need a new two-part splitting of the multiplication in a perm algebra, which differs from the usual splitting of the perm algebra (into the pre-perm algebra) by the characterized representation. This gives rise to the notion of an averaging-pre-perm algebra, or simply an apre-perm algebra. Furthermore, the notion of special apre-perm algebras which are apre-perm algebras with the second multiplications being commutative is introduced as the underlying algebra structure of perm algebras with nondegenerate symmetric left-invariant bilinear forms. The latter are also the induced structures of symmetric Frobenius commutative algebras with averaging operators. Consequently, a double construction of averaging Frobenius commutative algebra gives rise to a Manin triple of special apre-perm algebras. In terms of bialgebra structures, this means that an averaging commutative and cocommutative infinitesimal bialgebra gives rise to a special apre-perm bialgebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1988, Andrews, Dyson, and Hickerson showed that a $q$-series $\sigma$ found in Ramanujan's lost notebook and related to partitions could be interpreted as counting ideals in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})$, and found similar formulas for $\sigma$ in terms of ideals of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$. Cohen followed this by showing more generally that for certain triples of quadratic fields, there is abelian extension and conductor so that the ray class character theta series for all three fields coincide. In the intervening years, several $q$-series counting ideals in quadratic fields have been explored, nearly all relating to the fields explored by Andrews et al. In this paper we give an example of a ray class character theta series which stems from $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-6})$, $\mathbb{Q}(i)$, and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})$. We use recent work of Okano to give explicit formulas via quadratic form theta series with congruence conditions stemming from each field. We isolate an analogue of $\sigma$ for this series and show that it has coefficients also given by a partition generating function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A sequence $\mathbf{A}$ is said to be realizable if satisfies so called sign and Dold conditions. We will say that a sequence almost satisfies the Dold condition if there exists a constant $c\in\mathbb{N}_+$ such that $(cA_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}_+}$ satisfies the Dold condition. In this paper we give characterisation of sequences defined by linear recursion of any order that almost satisfy the Dold condition. We also give an upper bound on the value of $c$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this note, we provide three new, very short proofs of two interesting congruences for Merca's partition function $a(n)$, which enumerates integer partitions where the odd parts have multiplicity at most 2. These modulo 2 congruences were first shown elementarily by Sellers. We then frame $a(n)$ into the much broader context of eta-quotients, and suggest how to comprehensively describe its parity behavior. In particular, extensive computations suggest that $a(n)$ is odd precisely 25\% of the time.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>If $G$ is a linearly reductive group acting rationally on a polynomial ring $S$, then the inclusion $S^{G} \hookrightarrow S$ possesses a unique $G$-equivariant splitting, called the Reynolds operator. We describe algorithms for computing the Reynolds operator for the classical actions as in Weyl's book. The groups are the general linear group, the special linear group, the orthogonal group, and the symplectic group, with their classical representations: direct sums of copies of the standard representation and copies of the dual representation.</p></details>
