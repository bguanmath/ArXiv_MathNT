 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Brody Lynch &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 28 pages, 1 figure. V3 has a rewritten version of section 3, a corrected proof of Proposition 3.6 and a simplified proof of Theorem 1.4

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\ell$ be prime, and $K$ be a number field containing the $\ell$-th roots of unity. We use classical algebraic number theory and some analytic techniques to prove that the Steinitz classes of $\mathbb Z/\ell\mathbb Z$ extensions of $K$ ordered by relative discriminant are equidistributed among realizable classes in the ideal class group of $K$. For $\ell = 2$, this was proved by Kable and Wright using the deep theory of prehomogeneous vector spaces. Foster proved that Steinitz classes are uniformly distributed between realizable classes for tamely ramified elementary-$m$ extensions using the theory of Galois modules; our approach eliminates this tameness hypothesis.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zhenhua Liu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Supersedes arXiv:2310.19860 and arXiv:2401.18074

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod $n$ homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}.$ As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod $n$ homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected and area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05890v2'>2211.05890</a>\]&nbsp; **Sparse Equidistribution of Geometric Invariants of Real Quadratic Fields**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Peter Humphries, Asbjørn Christian Nordentoft &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Duke, Imamo\=glu, and T\'oth have recently constructed a new geometric invariant, a hyperbolic orbifold, associated to each narrow ideal class of a real quadratic field. Furthermore, they have shown that the projection of these hyperbolic orbifolds onto the modular surface $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}$ equidistributes on average over a genus of the narrow class group as the fundamental discriminant $D$ of the real quadratic field tends to infinity. We extend this construction of hyperbolic orbifolds to allow for a level structure, akin to Heegner points and closed geodesics of level $q$. Additionally, we refine this equidistribution result in several directions. First, we investigate sparse equidistribution in the level aspect, where we prove the equidistribution of level $q$ hyperbolic orbifolds when restricted to a translate of $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}$ in $\Gamma_0(q) \backslash \mathbb{H}$, which presents some new interesting features. Second, we explore sparse equidistribution in the subgroup aspect, namely equidistribution on average over small subgroups of the narrow class group. Third, we prove small scale equidistribution and give upper bounds for the discrepancy. Behind these refinements is a new interpretation of the Weyl sums arising in these equidistribution problems in terms of ad\`elic period integrals, which in turn are related to Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions via Waldspurger's formula. The key remaining inputs are hybrid subconvex bounds for these $L$-functions and a certain homological version of the sup-norm problem.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 19 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables; v.3: Extended and corrected version with references to several new OEIS sequences

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A cryptarithm (or alphametic) is a mathematical puzzle in which numbers are represented with words in such a way that identical letters stand for equal digits and distinct letters for unequal digits. An alphametic puzzle is usually given in the form of an equation that needs to be solved, such as SEND + MORE = MONEY. Alternatively, here we will consider cryptarithms constrained not by an equation but by a particular subsequence of natural numbers, for example perfect squares or primes. Such a cryptarithm has a unique solution if there is exactly one term in the sequence that has the corresponding pattern of digits. We will call such terms cryptarithmically unique. Here we estimate the density of such terms in an arbitrary sequence for which the overall density of terms among integers is known. In particular, among all perfect squares below 10^12, slightly less than one half are cryptarithmically unique, their density increasing toward larger numbers. Cryptarithmically unique prime numbers, however, are initially very scarce. Combinatorial estimates suggest that their density should drop below 10^-300 for decimal lengths of approximately 1829 digits, but then it recovers and is asymptotic to unity for very large primes. Finally, we introduce and discuss primonumerophobic digit patterns that no prime number happens to have.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish the geometric Bogomolov conjecture for semiabelian varieties over function fields. We show a closed subvariety contains Zariski dense sets of small points, if and only if, after modulo its stabilizer, it is a torsion translate of a constant variety. A new phenomenon is that a special subvariety may not have a Zariski dense set of points of height 0.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We solve the classical and quantum problems for the 1D sigma model with target space the flag manifold $\mathrm{U}(3)\over \mathrm{U}(1)^3$, equipped with the most general invariant metric. In particular, we explicitly describe all geodesics in terms of elliptic functions and demonstrate that the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator may be found by solving polynomial (Bethe) equations. The main technical tool that we use is a mapping between the sigma model and a Gaudin model, which is also shown to hold in the $\mathrm{U}(n)$ case.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Omkar Baraskar, Ingrid Vukusic &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages; comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $s(n)$ be the number of different remainders $n \bmod k$, where $1 \leq k \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$. This rather natural sequence is sequence A283190 in the OEIS and while some basic facts are known, it seems that surprisingly it has barely been studied. First, we prove that $s(n) = c \cdot n + O(n/(\log n \log \log n))$, where $c$ is an explicit constant. Then we focus on differences between consecutive terms $s(n)$ and $s(n+1)$. It turns out that the value can always increase by at most one, but there exist arbitrarily large decreases. We show that the differences are bounded by $O(\log \log n)$. Finally, we consider ''iterated remainder sets''. These are related to a problem arising from Pierce expansions, and we prove bounds for the size of these sets as well.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Matthew Stover &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Suppose $\Gamma < \mathrm{PU}(n,1)$ is a cocompact arithmetic lattice of simplest type with profinite completion $\widehat{\Gamma}$. This paper proves there is an open subgroup $\widehat{\Gamma}_0 \le \widehat{\Gamma}$ such that $H^j(\widehat{\Delta}, \mathbb{F}_p)$ is nontrivial for every open subgroup ${\widehat{\Delta} \le \widehat{\Gamma}_0}$, $j \le 2n$, and sufficiently large prime $p$. If $n \ge 2$, nonvanishing is new for all $j \ge 2$. Consequently, the virtual cohomological dimension of $\widehat{\Gamma}$ is at least $2n$, improving the previous lower bound of $1$. The proof shows there is a profinite fundamental class for the associated ball quotient and that its canonical class is profinite modulo torsion. For congruence $\Gamma$ and $j < \frac{n+1}{2}$, restriction ${H^j(\widehat{\Gamma}, \mathbb{F}_p) \to H^j(\Gamma, \mathbb{F}_p)}$ is shown to be almost surjective in a precise sense; this is related to whether lattices in $\mathrm{PU}(n,1)$ are good in the sense of Serre, which is only known to hold for $n=1$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Brandon Alberts &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a Dirichlet series $L(s) = \sum a_n n^{-s}$, the asymptotic growth rate of $\sum_{n\le X} a_n$ can be determined by a Tauberian theorem. Bounds on the error term are typically controlled by the size of $|L(\sigma+it)|$ for fixed real part $\sigma$. We modify this approach to prove new Tauberian theorems with error terms depending only on the average size of $L(\sigma+it)$ as $t$ varies, and we take care to track explicit dependence on various parameters. This often leads to stronger error bounds, and introduces strong connections between asymptotic counting problems and moments of $L$-functions. We provide self-contained statements of Tauberian theorems in anticipation that these results can be used ``out of the box'' to prove new asymptotic expansions. We demonstrate this by proving square root saving error bounds for the number of $C_n$-extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ of bounded discriminant when $n=3$, $4$, $8$, $16$, or $2p$ for $p$ an odd prime.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20719v1'>2508.20719</a>\]&nbsp; **The lattice packing problem in dimension 9 by Voronoi's algorithm**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Mathieu Dutour Sikirić, Wessel van Woerden &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1908, Voronoi introduced an algorithm that solves the lattice packing problem in any dimension in finite time. Voronoi showed that any lattice with optimal packing density must be a so-called perfect lattice, and his algorithm enumerates the finitely many perfect lattices up to similarity in a fixed dimension. However, due to the high complexity of the algorithm this enumeration had, until now, only been completed up to dimension 8. In this work we compute all 2237251040 perfect lattices in dimension 9 via Voronoi's algorithm. As a corollary, this shows that the laminated lattice $\Lambda_9$ gives the densest lattice packing in dimension 9. Equivalently, we show that the Hermite constant $\gamma_9$ in dimension 9 equals $2$. Furthermore, we extend a result by Watson (1971) and show that the set of possible kissing numbers in dimension 9 is precisely $2 \cdot \{ 1, \ldots, 91, 99, 120, \ldots, 129, 136 \}$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Victor de Vries, Haowen Zhang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 28 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a homogeneous space $X$ over a number field $k$, the Brauer-Manin obstruction has been used to study strong approximation for $X$ away from a finite set $S$ of places, and known results state that $X(k)$ is dense in the omitting-$S$ projection of the Brauer-Manin set $\mathrm{pr}_S(X(\mathbb{A}_k)^{\mathrm{br}})$, under certain assumptions. In order to completely understand the closure of $X(k)$ in the set of $S$-adelic points $X(\mathbb{A}_k^S)$, we ask: (i) whether $\mathrm{pr}_S(X(\mathbb{A}_k)^{\mathrm{br}})$ is closed in $X(\mathbb{A}_k^S)$; (ii) whether $X(k)$ is dense in the closed subset of $X(\mathbb{A}_k^S)$ cut out by elements in $\mathrm{br}X$ which induce zero evaluation maps at all the places in $S$. We also ask these questions considering only the algebraic Brauer group. We give answers to such questions for homogeneous spaces $X$ under semisimple simply connected groups with commutative stabilizers.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Li Zhu, Juncheng Zhou, Jinle Liu, Hongfeng Wu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we introduce the definition of equal-difference cyclotomic coset, and prove that in general any cyclotomic coset can be decomposed into a disjoint union of equal-difference subsets. Among the equal-difference decompositions of a cyclotomic coset, an important class consists of those in the form of cyclotomic decompositions, called the multiple equal-difference representations of the coset. There is an equivalent correspondence between the multiple equal-difference representations of $q$-cyclotomic cosets modulo $n$ and the irreducible factorizations of $X^{n}-1$ in binomial form over finite extension fields of $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. We give an explicit characterization of the multiple equal-difference representations of any $q$-cyclotomic coset modulo $n$, through which a criterion for $X^{n}-1$ factoring into irreducible binomials is obtained. In addition, we present an algorithm to simplify the computation of the leaders of cyclotomic cosets.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f_1,f_2$ be holomorphic modular forms of the same weight for a cocompact lattice $\Gamma < \mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbf{R})$. We estimate the rate of decay of the coefficients in the expansion of $f_1\overline{f_2}$ in a Laplace eigenbasis. By specializing our main theorem to the case where $\Gamma$ is arithmetic, we obtain new instances of the Weyl bound for triple product $L$-functions in the spectral aspect. Our method builds on the conformal bootstrap in physics.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a generalized class of weighted $k$-regular partitions defined by $$ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_{k, r_1, r_2}(n) q^n = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(1 - q^{nk})^{r_1}}{(1 - q^n)^{r_2}}, $$ which extends the classical $k$-regular partition function $b_k(n)$. We establish new infinite families of Ramanujan-type congruences, divisibility results, and positive-density prime sets for which $c_{k, r_1, r_2}(n)$ vanishes modulo a given prime. These results generalize recent work on $5$-regular partitions and reveal deeper modular and combinatorial structures underlying weighted partition functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime number and $\zeta_p$ a primitive $p$-th root of unity. Chebotarev's theorem states that every square submatrix of the $p \times p$ matrix $(\zeta_p^{ij})_{i,j=0}^{p-1}$ is non-singular.

As an application, an uncertainty principle for cyclic groups of order $n$ is established when $n=pr$ as described above.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a linear--independence principle for finite families of translates in irreducible, square--integrable modulo the center (SI/Z) representations of step--two nilpotent Lie groups with one--dimensional center. Fix a one--parameter subgroup $\exp(\mathbb R X)$ and a noncentral element $Y$ (not assumed to commute with $X$). For every nonzero smooth vector $f$, any finite collection $\{\pi(\exp(x_k X))f\}_{k=1}^m$ (with distinct parameters $x_k$) of translates along $\exp(\mathbb R X)$, together with the single translate $\pi(\exp Y)f$, is linearly independent. The proof combines Schwartz regularity of matrix coefficients in the noncentral variables with an ergodic log--product estimate on a compact torus generated by commutator phases. As a result, we obtain an HRT--type statement for $(m,1)$ configurations (on--line direction with zero $X_{k_0}$--component and rogue $\exp X_{k_0}$) for all nonzero Schwartz windows, without spacing restrictions.</p></details>

Specifically, among other things, I shall show that $$ \forall n \geq 4, \qquad\forall x \geq \exp(\exp(33)), \qquad \hbox{there are primes in the interval} \left[x, x+ x^{1-{1\over n}}\right]; $$ $$ \forall n \geq 91, \qquad\forall x \geq [90^{90}]^{n/(n-90)} , \qquad \hbox{there are primes in the interval} \left[x, x+ x^{1-{1\over n}}\right]. $$ Furthermore $$ \forall n \geq 106, \qquad\forall x \geq 1, \qquad \hbox{there are primes in the interval} \left[x, x+ x^{1-{1\over n}}\right]. $$ In particular this last observation makes both the Hoheisel and Heilbronn results fully explicit and effective. This (relatively) specific observation can be extended and generalized in various manners.</p></details>

Manchon introduces the contracting arborification (resp. the simple arborification), which is maps from the BCK Hopf algebras of the decorated rooted trees corresponding to the series expression (resp. the integral expression) to the non-commutative polynomial algebras of the set $\mathbb{N}$ (resp. the set $\{0,1\}$). There is a natural map between the two non-commutative polynomial algebras. Manchon posed the question of finding a natural map between the two BCK Hopf algebras that would make the diagram commutative. In this paper, we consider planar rooted trees and use a recursive method to construct such a map between the two BCK Hopf algebras, making the diagram commutative.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A well-known and fundamental property of the Macdonald polynomials $P_\lambda(x;q,t)$ is their invariance under the transformation sending $(q,t)$ to $(q^{-1},t^{-1})$. Recently, Concha and Lapointe showed that this property extends in an interesting, nontrivial way to an identity for partially symmetric Macdonald polynomials. Their identity played a key role in the work of Bechtloff Weising and Orr linking partially symmetric Macdonald polynomials to parabolic flag Hilbert schemes. In this paper, we refine the Concha-Lapointe identity to a sub-family of Alexandersson's permuted basement Macdonald polynomials and give a combinatorial proof of the refined identity. We show also that the Concha-Lapointe identity is equivalent to the assertion that (normalized) partially symmetric Macdonald polynomials are fixed under the Kazhdan-Lusztig involution.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages, latex; new section 4 of rigidity of braided non-semisimple r-categories added in v2

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a field, and let $\mathcal{C}$ be a Cauchy complete $k$-linear braided category with finite dimensional morphism spaces and ${{\rm End}(\bf 1)}=k$. We call an indecomposable object $X$ of $\mathcal C$ non-negligible if there exists $Y\in \mathcal{C}$ such that $\bf 1$ is a direct summand of $Y\otimes X$. We prove that every non-negligible object $X\in \mathcal{C}$ such that ${\rm dim}{\rm End}(X^{\otimes n})<n!$ for some $n$ is automatically rigid. In particular, if $\mathcal{C}$ is semisimple of moderate growth and weakly rigid, then $\mathcal{C}$ is rigid. As applications, we simplify Huang's proof of rigidity of representation categories of certain vertex operator algebras, and we get that for a finite semisimple monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$, the data of a $\mathcal{C}$-modular functor is equivalent to a modular fusion category structure on $\mathcal{C}$, answering a question of Bakalov and Kirillov. Finally, we show that if $\mathcal{C}$ is rigid and has moderate growth, then the quantum trace of any nilpotent endomorphism in $\mathcal{C}$ is zero. Hence $\mathcal{C}$ admits a semisimplification, which is a semisimple braided tensor category of moderate growth. Finally, we discuss rigidity in braided r-categories which are not semisimple, which arise in logarithmic conformal field theory. These results allow us to simplify a number of arguments of Kazhdan and Lusztig.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Version 2: Removed Remark 2.1, which contained an imprecise application of Harish-Chandra's theory. The main results of the paper are unaffected by this removal

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper explicitly constructs a family of weight-shifting operators mapping from the space of weight-k smooth automorphic functions, A_k(Gamma), to the space of weight-t automorphic functions, A_t(Gamma). These operators are defined as integral transforms whose kernel, K, is the product of the covariant factor P given in Definition 1.2 and a function, F, which is invariant under the diagonal action of SL(2, R). The key assumption in the operator's construction is the spectral condition posited in Hypothesis 1.1, namely that the kernel K is an eigenfunction of the weight-t hyperbolic Laplacian Delta_t with respect to the first variable. This partial differential equation reduces to an ordinary differential equation for the invariant function F, which is shown to be equivalent to the Hypergeometric Differential Equation (HDE). The main result of this paper, presented in Theorem 2.1, is the explicit determination of the HDE parameters (a,b,c) as functions of the initial automorphic data (k, t, q) and the operator's spectral parameter lambda_K. This work presents an analytic methodology for the explicit construction of an intertwining operator that maps a Laplacian eigenspace to its corresponding eigenspace, demonstrating how the kernel is determined from the automorphic data via the Hypergeometric Differential Equation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The $\frak{sl}_2$ KZ differential equations with values in the tensor power of the fundamental representation with parameter $\kappa=\pm 2$ are considered. A Satake-type correspondence is established over complex numbers and subsequently reduced to finite characteristic. This correspondence enables the study of the KZ equations on the lower weight subspaces of the tensor power in terms of the wedge powers of the weight subspace of the weight just below the highest weight. We apply this approach to analyze the $p$-curvature operators associated with our KZ equations, evaluate the dimension of the solution space in characteristic $p$, and determine whether all solutions are generated by the so-called $p$-hypergeometric solutions. In particular, we show that not all solutions of the KZ equations with $\kappa=2$ in characteristic $p$ are generated by $p$-hypergeometric solutions. Previously, no such examples were known.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 16 pages, 4 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and analyze the ordered Zeckendorf game, a novel combinatorial two-player game inspired by Zeckendorf's Theorem, which guarantees a unique decomposition of every positive integer as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Building on the original Zeckendorf game\ -- previously studied in the context of unordered multisets\ -- we impose a new constraint: all moves must respect the order of summands. The result is a richer and more nuanced strategic landscape that significantly alters game dynamics. Unlike the classical version, where Player 2 has a dominant strategy for all $n > 2$, our ordered variant reveals a more balanced and unpredictable structure. In particular, we find that Player 1 wins for nearly all values $n \leq 25$, with a single exception at $n = 18$. This shift in strategic outcomes is driven by our game's key features: adjacency constraints that limit allowable merges and splits to neighboring terms, and the introduction of a switching move that reorders pairs. We prove that the game always terminates in the Zeckendorf decomposition\ -- now in ascending order\ -- by constructing a strictly decreasing monovariant. We further establish bounds on game complexity: the shortest possible game has length exactly $n - Z(n)$, where $Z(n)$ is the number of summands in the Zeckendorf decomposition of $n$, while the longest game exhibits quadratic growth, with $M(n) \sim \frac{n^2}{2}$ as $n \to \infty$. Empirical simulations suggest that random game trajectories exhibit log-normal convergence in their move distributions. Overall, the ordered Zeckendorf game enriches the landscape of number-theoretic games, posing new algorithmic challenges and offering fertile ground for future exploration into strategic complexity, probabilistic behavior, and generalizations to other recurrence relations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish an effective Bertini-type theorem for hypersurfaces $X_f \colon f = 0$ defined over a finite field $k$ for which $f$ has no linear factors over the algebraic closure $\overline{k}$. Given a line $L$ defined over $k$ and a nonreduced $\overline{k}$-point $x$ on $X_f \cap L$, we give an upper bound on the number of planes $P$ containing $L$ for which $X_f \cap P$ contains a line through $x$. Underlying this result is a factorization algorithm for bivariate polynomials originally due to Kaltofen, which we present with slightly relaxed hypotheses. Our primary application is to Artin's conjecture on $p$-adic forms of degree 7: if $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is a finite extension with residue field isomorphic to $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $F(x_0, \ldots, x_n) \in K[x_0, \ldots, x_{49}]$ is a homogeneous form of degree 7, then there exists a $K$-solution to $F=0$ whenever $q>679$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A hyperbinary partition of the nonnegative integer n is a partition where every part is a power of 2 and every part appears at most twice. We give three applications of the length generating function for such partitions, denoted by h_q(n).

As our first application we show that [r/s]_q = q h_q(n-1)/h_q(n) where r/s occurs as the nth entry in the Calkin-Wilf enumeration of the non-negative rationals. Next we consider fence posets which are those which can be obtained from a sequence of chains by alternately pasting together maxima and minima. For every n we show there is a fence poset F(n) whose lattice of order ideals is isomorphic to the poset of hyperbinary partitions of n ordered by refinement. For our last application, Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko also showed that [r/s]_q can be computed by taking products of certain matrices which are q-analogues of the standard generators for the special linear group SL(2,R). We express the entries of these products in terms of the polynomials h_q(n).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Zeckendorf proved that every positive integer can be written as a decomposition of non-adjacent Fibonacci numbers. Baird-Smith, Epstein, Flint, and Miller converted the process of decomposing an integer $n$ into a 2-player game, using the moves of $F_i + F_{i-1} = F_{i+1}$ and $2F_i = F_{i+1} + F_{i-2}$, where $F_i$ is the $ith$ Fibonacci number. They showed non-constructively that for $n \neq 2$, Player 2 has a winning strategy: a constructive solution remains unknown. We expand on this by investigating ``black hole'' variants of this game. The $F_m$ Black Hole Zeckendorf game is played with any $n$ but solely in columns $F_i$ for $i < m$. Gameplay is similar to the original Zeckendorf game, except any piece that would be placed on $F_i$ for $i \geq m$ is locked out in a ``black hole'' and removed from play. With these constraints, we analyze the games with black holes on $F_3$ and $F_4$ and construct a solution for specific configurations, using a non-constructive proof to lead to a constructive one. We also examine a pre-game in which players take turns placing down $n$ pieces in the outermost columns before the decomposition phase, and find constructive solutions for any $n$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish uniform bounds on the multiplicities of irreducible admissible representations appearing in spaces of functions on symmetric spaces over $p$-adic fields. These multiplicities can exceed one and depend intricately on the group, the space, and the representation, making exact computations often infeasible. This motivates the search for bounds depending only on simple structural parameters. More precisely, let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a non-Archimedean local field $F$ of odd residual characteristic, and let $\theta$ be a rational involution with fixed-point subgroup $H = G^\theta$. For any unramified smooth character $\chi$ of $H$, we show that the multiplicity $$ \dim \mathrm{Hom}_G(\rho, C^\infty(G/H,\chi)) $$ is uniformly bounded for a broad class of irreducible admissible representations $\rho$ of $G$, conjecturally including all such representations. The bound depends only on the rank of $G$ and the residue degree of $F$. Our method combines Mackey theory with cohomological techniques. As an application, we deduce a uniform bound on such multiplicities for all but finitely many local completions of a fixed number field.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of brick-splitting torsion pairs as a modern analogue and generalization of the classical notion of splitting torsion pairs. A torsion pair is called brick-splitting if any given brick is either torsion or torsion-free with respect to that torsion pair. After giving some properties of these pairs, we fully characterize them in terms of some lattice-theoretical properties, including left modularity. This leads to the notion of brick-directed algebras, which are those for which there does not exist any cycle of non-zero non-isomorphisms between bricks. This class of algebras is a novel generalization of representation-directed algebras. We show that brick-directed algebras have many interesting properties and give several characterizations of them. In particular, we prove that a brick-finite algebra is brick-directed if and only if the lattice of torsion classes is left modular (or equivalently, extremal). We also give a characterization of brick-directed algebras in terms of their wall-and-chamber structure, as well as of a certain Newton polytope associated to them. Moreover, we introduce an explicit construction of an abundance of brick-directed algebras, both of the tame and wild representation types.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the Habiro ring of a number field $\mathbb{K}$ and modules over it graded by $K_3(\mathbb{K})$. Elements of these modules are collections of power series at each complex root of unity that arithmetically glue with each other after applying a Frobenius endomorphism, and after dividing at each prime by a collection of series that depends solely on an element of the Bloch group. The main theorems of this paper concern number fields, their algebraic $K$-theory and its regulator maps (Borel, $p$-adic and \'etale), whereas the explicit collections of series are defined by a careful algebraic analysis of the infinite Pochhammer symbol at roots of unity. The origin of the above mentioned power series comes from perturbative Chern--Simons theory and by expansions of the admissible series of Kontsevich--Soibelman, both ultimately related to the infinite Pochhammer symbol. This link suggests that some Donaldson-Thomas invariants have arithmetic meaning and that some elements of the Habiro ring of a number field have enumerative meaning. Added subsection 1.1 explaining what the paper is about and subsection 1.8 explaining the relation to perturbative complex Chern-Simons theory.</p></details>

We prove that $$L(1,\lambda\nu)\neq 0$$ for all but finitely many finite order characters $\nu$ of $\Gamma_{\mathfrak{p}}$ such that $\epsilon(\lambda\nu)=+1$. For an ordinary prime $\ell$ with respect to the CM quadratic extension $K/F$, we also determine the $\ell$-adic valuation of the normalised Hecke $L$-values $L^{{\mathrm{alg}}}(1,\lambda\nu)$. As an application, we complete Hsieh's proof of Eisenstein congruence divisibility towards the CM Iwasawa main conjecture over $K$. Our approach and results complement the prior work initiated by Hida's ideas on the arithmetic of Hilbert modular Eisenstein series, studied via mod $\ell$ analogue of the Andr\'e--Oort conjecture. The previous results established the non-vanishing only for a Zariski dense subset of characters $\nu$. Our approach is based on the arithmetic of a CM modular form on a Shimura set, studied via arithmetic of the CM field and Ratner's ergodicity of unipotent flows.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Macdonald operator is known to coincide with a certain element of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra in the Fock representation of levels $(1,0)$. A generalization of this operator to higher levels $(r,0)$ can be built using the coproduct structure, it is diagonalized by the generalized Macdonald symmetric functions, indexed by $r$-tuple partitions and depending on $r$ alphabets. In this paper, we extend to the generalized case some of the known formulas obeyed by ordinary Macdonald symmetric functions, such as the $e_1$-Pieri rule or the identity relating them to Whittaker vectors obtained by Garsia, Haiman, and Tesler. We also propose a generalization of the five-term relation, and the Fourier/Hopf pairing.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using the ratios theorems, we calculate the leading order terms in $N$ for the following averages of the characteristic polynomial and its derivative: $\left< \left|\Lambda_A(1 )\right| ^{r} \frac{ \Lambda_A'(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi}) }{ \Lambda_A(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi})} \right>_{SO(2N)}$ and $\left< \left|\Lambda_A(1 )\right| ^{r} \frac{ \Lambda_A'(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi}) }{ \Lambda_A(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi})} \right>_{USp(2N)}$. Our expression, derived for integer $r$, permits analytic continuation in $r$ and we conjecture that this agrees with the above averages for non-integer exponents. We use this result to obtain an expression for the one level density of the `excised ensemble', a subensemble of $SO(2N)$, to next-to-leading order in $N$. We then present the analogous calculation for the one level density of quadratic twists of elliptic curve $L$-functions, taking into account a number theoretical bound on the central values of the $L$-functions. The method we use to calculate the above random matrix averages uses the contour integral form of the ratios theorems, which are a key tool in the growing literature on averages of characteristic polynomials and their derivatives, and as we evaluate the next-to-leading term for large matrix size $N$, this leads to some multi-dimensional contour integrals that are slightly asymmetric in the integration variables, which might be useful in other work.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For nonzero coprime integers $a$ and $b$, a positive integer $\ell$ is said to be \emph{good with respect to $a$ and $b$} if there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $\ell$ divides $a^{k} + b^{k}$. The concept of good integers has been the subject of continuous investigation since the 1990s due to their elegant number-theoretic properties and their significant applications in various areas, particularly in coding theory. This paper provides a comprehensive review of good integers, emphasizing both their theoretical foundations and their practical implications. We first revisit the fundamental number-theoretic properties of good integers and present their characterizations in a systematic manner. The exposition is enriched with well-structured algorithms and illustrative diagrams that facilitate their computation and classification. Subsequently, we explore applications of good integers in the study of algebraic coding theory. In particular, their roles in the characterization, construction, and enumeration of self-dual cyclic codes and complementary dual cyclic codes are discussed in detail. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the theory. This review not only consolidates existing results but also highlights the unifying role of good integers in bridging number theory and coding theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 130 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce limit categories for cotangent stacks of smooth stacks as an effective version of classical limits of categories of D-modules on them. We develop their general theory and pursue their relation with categories of D-modules. In particular, we establish the functorial properties of limit categories such as the smooth pull-back and projective push-forward. Using the notion of limit categories, we propose a precise formulation of the Dolbeault geometric Langlands conjecture, proposed by Donagi-Pantev as the classical limit of the de Rham geometric Langlands equivalence. It states an equivalence between the derived categories of moduli stacks of semistable Higgs bundles and limit categories of moduli stacks of all Higgs bundles. We prove the existence of a semiorthogonal decomposition of the limit category into quasi-BPS categories, which are categorical versions of BPS invariants on a non-compact Calabi-Yau 3-fold. This semiorthogonal decomposition is interpreted as a Langlands dual to the semiorthogonal decomposition constructed in our previous work on the category of coherent sheaves on the moduli stack of semistable Higgs bundles. We also construct Hecke operators on limit categories for Higgs bundles. They are expected to be compatible with Wilson operators under our formulation of Dolbeault geometric Langlands conjecture. The conjectured equivalence implies an equivalence between BPS categories for semistable Higgs bundles, which we expect to be a categorical version of the topological mirror symmetry conjecture for Higgs bundles by Hausel-Thaddeus.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a general and effective algebraic framework for enumerating finite-length quotients of a torsion-free sheaf of arbitrary rank (the Quot zeta function) and finite-length coherent sheaves (the Coh zeta function) over reduced singular curves. We show that the Coh zeta function can be recovered as a transparent high-rank limit of Quot zeta functions. We prove that Quot zeta functions are motivically rational, using a novel parametrization and the geometry of affine Grassmannians, and that they satisfy an arbitrary-rank reflection principle, via harmonic analysis. As a first application, we compute explicit formulas for these zeta functions for all $y^2 = x^n$ singularities, revealing a surprising and previously unknown connection to Rogers--Ramanujan type $q$-series. Further applications to the enumerative geometry of affine Springer fibers and commuting varieties are also discussed.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We address two questions related to the semiampleness of line bundles arising from Hodge theory. First, we prove there is a functorial compactification of the image of a period map of a polarizable integral pure variation of Hodge structures for which the Griffiths bundle extends amply. In particular the Griffiths bundle is semiample. We prove more generally that the Hodge bundle of a Calabi--Yau variation of Hodge structures is semiample subject to some extra conditions, and as our second result deduce the b-semiampleness conjecture of Prokhorov--Shokurov. The semiampleness results (and the construction of the Baily--Borel compactifications) crucially use o-minimal GAGA, and the deduction of the b-semiampleness conjecture uses work of Ambro and results of Koll\'ar on the geometry of minimal lc centers to verify the extra conditions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Word maps have been studied for matrix groups over a field. We initiate the study of problems related to word maps in the context of the group $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathscr O_2)$, where $\mathscr O_2$ is a finite local principal ideal ring of length two (e.g. $\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb F_q[t]/\langle t^2\rangle$). We study the power map $g\mapsto g^L$, where $L$ is a positive integer. We consider $L$ to be coprime to $p$ (an odd prime), the characteristic of the residue field $k$ of $\mathscr O_2$. We classify all the elements in the image, whose mod-$\mathfrak m$ reduction in $\mathrm{GL}_n(k)$ are either regular semisimple or cyclic, where $\mathfrak m$ is the unique maximal ideal of $\mathscr O_2$. Our main tool is a Hensel lifting for polynomial equations over $\mathrm{M}_n(\mathscr O_2)$, which we establish in this work. A central contribution of this work is the construction of canonical forms for certain natural classes of matrices over $\mathscr O_2$. As applications, we derive explicit generating functions for the probabilities that a random element of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathscr O_2)$ is regular semisimple, $L$-power regular semisimple, compatible cyclic, or $L$-power compatible cyclic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a conservative ergodic measure-preserving transformation $T$ of the measure space $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$ with $\mu$ a $\sigma$-finite measure and $\mu(X)=\infty$. Given an observable $g:X\to \mathbb{R}$, it is well known from results by Aaronson that in general the asymptotic behaviour of the Birkhoff sums $S_Ng(x):= \sum_{j=1}^N\, (g\circ T^{j-1})(x)$ strongly depends on the point $x\in X$, and that there exists no sequence $(d_N)$ for which $S_Ng(x)/d_N \to 1$ for $\mu$-almost every $x\in X$. In this paper we consider the case $g\not\in L^1(X,\mu)$ assuming that there exists $E\in\mathcal{B}$ with $\mu(E)<\infty$ and $\int_E g\,\mathrm{d}\mu=\infty$ and continue the investigation initiated in previous work by the authors. We show that for transformations $T$ with strong mixing assumptions for the induced map on a finite measure set, the almost sure asymptotic behaviour of $S_Ng(x)$ for an unbounded observable $g$ may be obtained using two methods, adding a number of summands depending on $x$ to $S_Ng$ and trimming. The obtained sums are then asymptotic to a scalar multiple of $N$. The results are applied to a couple of non-regular continued fraction algorithms, the backward (or R\'enyi type) continued fraction and the even-integer continued fraction algorithms, to obtain the almost sure asymptotic behaviour of the sums of the digits of the algorithms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For coprime $p,q\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$, the triplet vertex operator algebra $W_{p,q}$ is a non-simple extension of the universal Virasoro vertex operator algebra of central charge $c_{p,q}=1-\frac{6(p-q)^2}{pq}$, and it is a basic example of a vertex operator algebra appearing in logarithmic conformal field theory. Here, we give a new construction of $W_{p,q}$ different from the original screening operator definition of Feigin-Gainutdinov-Semikhatov-Tipunin. Using our earlier work on the tensor category structure of modules for the Virasoro algebra at central charge $c_{p,q}$, we show that the simple modules appearing in the decomposition of $W_{p,q}$ as a module for the Virasoro algebra have $PSL_2$-fusion rules and generate a symmetric tensor category equivalent to $\mathrm{Rep}\,PSL_2$. Then we use the theory of commutative algebras in braided tensor categories to construct $W_{p,q}$ as an appropriate non-simple modification of the canonical algebra in the Deligne tensor product of $\mathrm{Rep}\,PSL_2$ with this Virasoro subcategory. As a consequence, we show that the automorphism group of $W_{p,q}$ is $PSL_2(\mathbb{C})$. We also define a braided tensor category $\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ consisting of modules for the Virasoro algebra at central charge $c_{p,q}$ that induce to untwisted modules of $W_{p,q}$. We show that $\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ tensor embeds into the $PSL_2(\mathbb{C})$-equivariantization of the category of $W_{p,q}$-modules and is closed under contragredient modules. We conjecture that $\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ has enough projective objects and is the correct category of Virasoro modules for constructing logarithmic minimal models in conformal field theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The $g$-fan $\Sigma(A)$ of a finite dimensional algebra $A$ is a non-singular fan in its real Grothendieck group, defined by tilting theory. If the union ${\rm P}(A)$ of the simplices associated with the cones of $\Sigma(A)$ is convex, we call $A$ $g$-convex. In this case, the $g$-polytope ${\rm P}(A)$ of $A$ is a reflexive polytope. Thus, in each dimension, there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of fans that can be realized as $g$-fans of $g$-convex algebras. An important problem is to classify such fans for a fixed dimension $d$. In this paper, we give a complete answer for the case $d=3$: we prove that there are precisely 61 convex $g$-fans of dimension 3 up to isomorphism. Our method is based on the decomposition of fans into the $2^3$ orthants in the real Grothendieck group of $A$, together with a detailed analysis of possible sequences of $g$-vectors arising from iterated mutations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study cancellation in sums of Hecke eigenvalues over irreducible quadratic polynomials over short intervals. In particular, we look at an average over bases of Hecke forms of weight $k$ in the range $\vert k-K\vert<K^\theta$ where $1/3<\theta<1$. We see that when averaged over this family such sums admit square root cancellation. The key new arithmetic input for such a result is a bound on sums of Kloosterman sums over irreducible quadratic polynomials. Then using work of Nelson, we relate such sums to the mass equidistribution conjecture for modular forms on compact arithmetic surfaces, and we show that almost all forms satisfy the mass equidistribution conjecture. Furthermore, such forms will satisfy the conjecture with an effective convergence rate of $k^{-\delta}$ for any $\delta<1/2$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jianmin Chen, Yiting Zheng &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a combinatorial description of morphisms in the coherent sheaf category ${\rm coh}\mbox{-}\mathbb{X}(p,q)$ over weighted projective line of type $(p,q)$ via a marked annulus. This leads to a geometric realization of exceptional sequences in ${\rm coh}\mbox{-}\mathbb{X}(p,q)$. As applications, we present a classification of complete exceptional sequences, an effective method for enlarging exceptional sequences, and a new proof of the transitivity of the braid group action on complete exceptional sequences. Besides, we offer a combinatorial description of tilting bundles via lattice paths and count the number of tilting sheaves in ${\rm coh}\mbox{-}\mathbb{X}(p,q)$, up to the Auslander-Reiten translation.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Two distinct earlier preprints are relevant. The first covers half-iterates of $x(1+x)$, sin$(x)$ & exp$(x/e)$ and appears at arXiv:2506.07625v1. The second covers half-iterates of $x$exp$(x)$, $x+1/x$ & arcsinh$(x)$ and appears at arXiv:2506.07625v2. Reading these will help to motivate the study of $\delta$ in the current paper. 9 pages; 2 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The vivid contrast between two competing algorithms for solving Abel's equation $g(\theta(x)) = g(x) + 1$, given $\theta(x)$, is easily sketched. EJ is faster and more efficient, but ML evaluates a limit characterizing the principal solution $g(x)$ directly. EJ finds $g(x)+\delta$, where $\delta$ is possibly nonzero but independent of $x$. If we were to know an exact expression for $\delta$, then the "intrinsicality" of ML would be subsumed by EJ. Filling this gap in our knowledge is the aim of this paper.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that if $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k$ are algebraic numbers, then $$|A+\lambda_1\cdot A+\dots+\lambda_k\cdot A|\geq H(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k)|A|-o(|A|)$$ for all finite subsets $A$ of $\mathbb{C}$, where $H(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k)$ is an explicit constant that is best possible. The proof combines several ingredients, including a lower bound estimate on the measure of sums of linear transformations of compact sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$, a variant of Freiman's theorem tuned specifically to sums of dilates and the analysis of what we call lattice density, which succinctly captures how a subset of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is arranged relative to a given flag of lattices. As an application, we revisit the study of sums of linear transformations of finite sets, in particular proving an asymptotically best possible lower bound for sums of two linear transformations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present new expressions for the $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers, say $F_k(n)$. They satisfy the recurrence $F_k(n) = F_k(n-1) +\dots+F_k(n-k)$. Explicit expressions for the roots of the auxiliary (or characteristic) polynomial are presented, using Fuss-Catalan numbers. Properties of the roots are enumerated. We quantify the accuracy of asymptotic approximations for $F_k(n)$ for $n\gg1$. Our results subsume and extend some results published by previous authors. We also present a basis (or `fundamental solutions') to solve the above recurrence for arbitrary initial conditions. We comment on the use of generating functions and multinomial sums for the $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers and related sequences. We note that the resulting multinomial sums are Dickson polynomials of the second kind in several variables. We also present what may be a new identity for companion matrices.</p></details>
