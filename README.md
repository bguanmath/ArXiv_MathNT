 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Egor Voronetsky &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Extended bibliography, simplified proof of theorem 5, and fixed definition of isotropic reductive group schemes

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We begin to study model-theoretic properties of non-split isotropic reductive group schemes. In this paper we show that the base ring $K$ is e-interpretable in the point group $G(K)$ of every sufficiently isotropic reductive group scheme $G$. In particular, the Diophantine problems in $K$ and $G(K)$ are equivalent. We also compute the centralizer of the elementary subgroup of $G(K)$ and the common normalizer of all its root subgroups.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Thomas Nicosanti, Pavel Putrov, Johann Quenta-Raygada &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** hep-th &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by some previously known facts from mathematical and physics literature, we explore certain relations between 3-dimensional topological gauge theories with continuous and finite gauge groups, commonly known as Chern-Simons (CS) and Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories, respectively. Specifically, we consider the continuous and finite gauge groups to be the same algebraic group over the complex numbers and a finite field, respectively. In this paper, we focus on the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ example and consider the relationship on the level of the corresponding partition functions on closed 3-manifolds. Mathematically, these are Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev and DW invariants. We find that the asymptotics of the DW theory when the number of elements of the finite field is large recovers the leading asymptotics of the CS theory at large level when the 3-manifold contains no hyperbolic components. As a byproduct, we develop efficient techniques to count the number of points over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$ of $\mathrm{SL}(2)$ representation varieties of fundamental groups of 3-manifolds, possibly with weights pulled back from a chosen class in $H^3(\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{F}_q),\mathrm{U}(1))$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Basudev Pattanayak &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 1st version; Comments and suggestions are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper proves the branching laws for the full class of unitarizable representations of general linear groups in non-Archimedean local fields, extending the original notion of Gan-Gross-Prasad relevant pair for Arthur-type representations \cite{GGP2, Gur, Cha_crelle}. Further, we provide an explicit computable algorithm to determine the generalized GGP relevant pair, as developed in \cite{Cha_qbl}. In particular, we show that if $π$ and $π'$ are any irreducible smooth representations of $\mathrm{GL_{n+1}(F)}$ and $\mathrm{GL_{n}(F)}$ respectively, and their Langlands data or Zelevinsky data are given in terms of multisegments, then through an algorithmic process we can determine whether the space $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{GL_n(F)}}(π, π')$ is non-zero. Finally, when one of the represntations $π$ and $ π'$ is a generalized Speh representation, we give a complete classification for the other one for which the Hom space is non-zero.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the Diophantine equation $x^4 + y^4 - w^2 = n$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, which is related to near misses for the quartic case of Fermat's Last Theorem. For certain $n$ we show that the set of solutions is infinite, or more generally not thin. Our approach is via the geometry of del Pezzo surfaces of degree $2$, and we prove a more general result on non-thinness of integral points on double conic bundle surfaces.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11595v1'>2512.11595</a>\]&nbsp; **On a tree of rational functions related to continued fractions**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Niels Langeveld, David Ralston &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DS &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we present a binary tree with vertices given by rational functions $p(x)/q(x)$; the root and functional derivation of children are inspired by continued fractions. We prove some special properties of the tree. For example, the zero solutions of the denominators $q(x)$ are all real negative numbers and are dense in $(-\infty,-1]$. For $x>0$ functions are non intersecting and form a dense subset of $(0,1)$. Furthermore, when evaluating the tree for positive rational values, the tree contains every rational in $(0,1)$ exactly once if and only if $x\in \mathbb{N}$. For $x=1$, one finds back the classical Farey tree which is related to regular continued fractions. In the last part, we will make a similar tree in a similar way but for backward continued fractions. We highlight some similarities and differences.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17023v2'>2410.17023</a>\]&nbsp; **The relatively universal cover of the natural embedding of the long root geometry for the group $\mathrm{SL}(n+1,\mathbb{K})$**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** I. Cardinali, L. Giuzzi, A. Pasini &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Revised version/30 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The long root geometry $A_{n,\{1,n\}}(\mathbb{K})$ for the special linear group $\mathrm{SL}(n+1,\mathbb{K})$ admits an embedding in the (projective space of) the vector space of the traceless square matrices of order $n+1$ with entries in the field $\mathbb{K}$, usually regarded as the {\em natural} embedding of $A_{n,\{1,n\}}(\mathbb{K})$. S. Smith and H. Völklein (A geometric presentation for the adjoint module of $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{K})$, {\em J. Algebra}, vol. 127) have proved that the natural embedding of $A_{2,\{1,2\}}(\mathbb{K})$ is relatively universal if and only if $\mathbb{K}$ is either algebraic over its minimal subfield or perfect with positive characteristic. They also give some information on the relatively universal embedding of $A_{2,\{1,2\}}(\mathbb{K})$ which covers the natural one, but that information is not sufficient to exhaustively describe it. The "if" part of Smith-Völklein's result also holds true for any $n$, as proved by Völklein in his investigation of the adjoint modules of Chevalley groups (H. Völklein, On the geometry of the adjoint representation of a Chevalley group, {\em J. Algebra}, vol. 127). In this paper we give an explicit description of the relatively universal embedding of $A_{n,\{1,n\}}(\mathbb{K})$ which covers the natural one. In particular, we prove that this relatively universal embedding has (vector) dimension equal to $\mathfrak{d}+n^2+2n$ where $\mathfrak{d}$ is the transcendence degree of $\mathbb{K}$ over its minimal subfield (if $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{K}) = 0$) or the generating rank of $\mathbb{K}$ over ${\mathbb K}^p$ (if $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{K}) = p > 0$). Accordingly, both the "if" and the "only if" part of Smith-Völklein's result hold true for every $n \geq 2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine the minimal spectral radii among all skew-reciprocal integer matrices of a fixed even dimension that are primitive or nonnegative and irreducible. In particular, except for dimension six, we show that each such class of matrices realises smaller spectral radii than the corresponding reciprocal class.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kaiji Kondo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the present paper, we study the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local fields from the point of view of anabelian geometry. In particular, we show that, under certain mild assumptions, the image of the natural homomorphism from the automorphism group of a mixed-characteristic local field to the outer automorphism group of the associated absolute Galois group is not a normal subgroup. Furthermore, we show that, for the absolute Galois group of a mixed-characteristic local field satisfying certain assumptions, there exist a continuous representation and a continuous automorphism of the group such that the former is irreducible, abelian, and crystalline, but the continuous representation obtained as the composite of the former with the latter is not even Hodge-Tate. These results significantly generalize previous works by Hoshi and Nishio. A key observation in obtaining these results is to focus on the analogy between the mapping class groups of topological surfaces and the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local fields. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first work applying results from the theory of mapping class groups to the anabelian geometry of mixed-characteristic local fields, going beyond a mere analogy between the two.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Emre Sen &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** v2. New results added: endomorphism algebras of convex subcategories, d-representation finite higher Nakayama algebras. References updated. Comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the derived category of mod-KQ for Dynkin quiver Q, we construct a full subcategory in a canonical way, so that its endomorphism algebra is a higher Auslander algebra of global dimension $3k+2$ for any $k\geq 1$. Furthermore, we extend this construction for higher analogues of representation finite and hereditary algebras. Specifically, if $M$ is an n-cluster tilting object in the bounded derived category of n-representation finite and n-hereditary algebra, then we construct a full subcategory in a canonical way, so that its endomorphism algebra is a higher Auslander algebra of global dimension $(n+2)k+n+1$ for any $k\geq 1$. As an application, we revisit the higher Auslander correspondence. Firstly, we describe the corresponding module categories that have higher cluster-tilting objects, and then we discuss their relationship with certain full subcategories of the derived category. Consequently, we obtain a vast list of n-representation finite n-hereditary algebras whose n-cluster tilting objects are always minimal generator-cogenerator. Moreover, resulting algebras can be realized as endomorphism algebras of certain full subcategories of (higher) cluster categories.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Martí Roset, Peter Xu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 44 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Starting from a topological treatment of the Eisenstein class of a torus bundle, we define log-rigid analytic classes for $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$. These are group cohomology classes for $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ valued on log-rigid analytic functions on Drinfeld's $p$-adic symmetric domain. Such classes can be evaluated at points attached to totally real fields of degree $n$ where $p$ is inert. We conjecture that these values are $p$-adic logarithms of Gross--Stark units in the narrow Hilbert class field of totally real fields. We provide evidence for the conjecture by comparing our constructions to $p$-adic $L$-functions. In addition, we prove it in certain situations where the totally real field is Galois over $\mathbb{Q}$, as a consequence of the fact that in this case there is a conjugate of a Gross--Stark unit in $\mathbb{Q}_p$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Oliver Gregory, Andreas Langer &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 38 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct log-motivic cohomology groups for semistable varieties and study the $p$-adic deformation theory of log-motivic cohomology classes. Our main result is the deformational part of a $p$-adic variational Hodge conjecture for varieties with semistable reduction: a rational log-motivic cohomology class in bidegree $(2n,n)$ lifts to a continuous pro-class if and only if its Hyodo-Kato class lies in the $n$-th step of the Hodge filtration. This generalises a theorem of Bloch-Esnault-Kerz which treats the good reduction case. In the case $n=1$ the lifting criterion is the one obtained by Yamashita for the logarithmic Picard group. Along the way, we relate log-motivic cohomology to logarithmic Milnor $K$-theory and the logarithmic Hyodo-Kato Hodge-Witt sheaves.</p></details>

> **Comment:** There are many mistakes and lapping with published in the literature

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper introduces and systematically studies Weyl-type, Witt-type, and non-associative algebras defined over expolynomial rings -- commutative rings generated by exponential functions $e^{αx}$, exponentials of exponentials $e^{\pm x^p e^{t}}$, and power functions $x^α$ for $α$ in an additive subgroup $\cA$ of a characteristic zero field $\FF$. We establish several fundamental structural results: scalar extensions preserve both the algebraic structure and simplicity; intermediate subalgebras associated with subgroups $\ZZ \subseteq \cB \subseteq \cA$ remain simple; the algebra of graded derivations is isomorphic to a semidirect product $\Weyl{e^{\pm x^p e^{t}},\; e^{\cA x},\; x^{\cA}} \rtimes \FF^n$; tensor products over disjoint variable sets decompose naturally into larger algebras; and a complete isomorphism criterion is given, showing that isomorphism depends precisely on the orbit of the parameter $p$ under the automorphism group of $\cA$ and the equality of the deformation parameter $t$. These theorems generalize classical results on Weyl and Witt algebras, provide new families of simple algebras, and offer a foundation for further research in deformation theory, representation theory, and cohomology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a singular filtration on a manifold, e.g. a subriemannian setting, one can understand the elliptic regularity problems through a special kind of calculus. The principal symbol in this calculus involves the unitary representations of a family of graded nilpotent groups. Not all the irreducible representations of these groups have to be taken into account however, the ones that should be considered form the Helffer-Nourrigat cone. This space thus plays the role of a phase space in subriemannian geometry. Its topology is however very singular, preventing any kind of geometry on it. We propose a way to desingularize it. The unitary spectrum of a nilpotent group can be stratified into strata that are locally compact Hausdorff, following Puckansky and Pedersen. We show how this stratification extends to the whole Helffer-Nourrigat cone. As a byproduct, we show that the C*-algebra of principal symbols and the one of pseudodifferential operators of order 0 are solvable with explicit subquotients.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 52 pages, 12 figures, final version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Extended Khovanov arc algebras $\mathrm{K}_m^n$ are graded associative algebras which naturally appear in a variety of contexts, from knot and link homology, low-dimensional topology and topological quantum field theory to representation theory and symplectic geometry. C. Stroppel conjectured in her ICM 2010 address that the bigraded Hochschild cohomology groups of $\mathrm{K}_m^n$ vanish in a certain range, implying that the algebras $\mathrm K_m^n$ admit no nontrivial A$_\infty$ deformations, in particular that the algebras are intrinsically formal. Whereas Stroppel's Conjecture is known to hold for the algebras $\mathrm K_m^1$ and $\mathrm K_1^n$ by work of Seidel and Thomas, we show that $\mathrm K_m^n$ does in fact admit nontrivial A$_\infty$ deformations with nonvanishing higher products for all $m, n \geq 2$. We describe both $\mathrm K_m^n$ and its Koszul dual concretely as path algebras of quivers with relations and give an explicit algebraic construction of A$_\infty$ deformations of $\mathrm K_m^n$ by using the correspondence between A$_\infty$ deformations of a Koszul algebra and filtered associative deformations of its Koszul dual. These deformations can also be viewed as A$_\infty$ deformations of Fukaya--Seidel categories associated to Hilbert schemes of surfaces based on recent work of Mak and Smith.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 31 pages HP: https://hp676.wordpress.com/

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct an arithmetic period map for cubic fourfolds, in direct analogy with Rizov's work on K3 surfaces. For each $N\geq 1$, we introduce a Deligne-Mumford stack $\widetilde{\mathcal{C}^{[N]}}$ of cubic fourfolds with level structure and prove that the associated period map $j_{N}:\widetilde{\mathcal{C}^{[N]}}_{\mathbb{C}}\to {\rm Sh}_{K_{N}}(L)_{\mathbb{C}}$ is algebraic, étale, and descends to $\mathbb{Q}$ whenever $N$ is coprime to $2310$. As an application, we develop complex multiplication theory for cubic fourfolds and show that every cubic fourfold of CM type is defined over an abelian extension of its reflex field. Moreover, using the CM theory for rank-21 cubic fourfolds, we provide an alternative proof of the modularity of rank-21 cubic fourfolds established by Livné.</p></details>

We derive an explicit formula for ramified orbital integrals, showing they are limits of unramified ones and that Arthur's definition yields a universal object, agreeing with that of Hoffmann-Wakatsuki. Finally, on the spectral side, we apply normalized intertwining operators to present the expansion in a form parallel to that of the geometric side.</p></details>

In this article, we show that if the inequality $ 0<\Vertλ_1 qα^n_1+\cdots+λ_k qα^n_k\Vert<\frac{θ^n}{q^{d+\varepsilon}} $ has infinitely many solutions in $(n, q,λ_1,\ldots,λ_k)\in \mathbb{N}^2\times (K^\times)^k$ with absolute logarithmic Weil height of $λ_i$ is small compared to $n$ and some $θ\in (0,1)$, then, in particular, the tuple $(λ_1 qα^n_1,\ldots, λ_k qα^n_k)$ is pseudo-Pisot, and at least one of $α_i$ is an algebraic integer. This result can be viewed as Roth's type theorem for linear combinations of powers of algebraic numbers over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. The case $q=1$ was recently proved by Kulkarni, Mavraki, and Nguyen \cite{kul}, which is a generalization of Mahler's question proved in \cite{corv}. As a consequence of our result, we obtain the following generalization of this question: let $α>1$ be an algebraic number with $d=[\mathbb{Q}(α):\mathbb{Q}]$. For a given $\varepsilon>0$, if the inequality $$ 0<\Vertλqα^n\Vert<\frac{θ^n}{q^{d+\varepsilon}} $$ has infinitely many solutions in the tuples $(n,q,λ)\in \mathbb{N}^2\times K^\times$ with absolute logarithmic Weil height of $λ$ is small compared to $n$ and $θ\in (0,1)$, then some power of $α$ is a Pisot number. As an application of this result, we deduce the transcendence of certain infinite products of algebraic numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unit-generated orders of a quadratic field are orders of the form $\mathcal{O} = \mathbb{Z}[\varepsilon]$, where $\varepsilon$ is a unit in the quadratic field. If the order $\mathcal{O}$ is a maximal order of a real quadratic field, then the quadratic number field is necessarily of a restricted form, being of narrow Richaud--Degert type. However, every real quadratic field contains infinitely many distinct unit-generated orders. They are parametrized as $\mathcal{O} = \mathcal{O}_{n}^{\pm}$ having quadratic discriminants $Δ(\mathcal{O}) = Δ_{n}^{+} = n^2 - 4$ (for $n \geq 3$) and $Δ(\mathcal{O}) = Δ_{n}^{-} = n^2 + 4$ (for $n \geq 1$). We show the (wide or narrow) class numbers of unit-generated orders satisfy $\log \left|{\rm Cl}(\mathcal{O})\right| \sim \log \frac{1}{2}\left|Δ(\mathcal{O})\right|$ as $\left|Δ(\mathcal{O})\right| \to \infty$, using a result of L.-K. Hua. We deduce that there are finitely many unit-generated quadratic orders of class number one and finitely many unit-generated quadratic orders whose class group is $2$-torsion. We classify all unit-generated real quadratic maximal orders having class number one. We provide numerical lists of quadratic unit-generated orders whose class groups are $2$-torsion for $Δ\leq 10^{10}$, for both wide and narrow class groups, which are conjecturally complete.</p></details>

When $θ$ has a finite irrationality measure, it is known that decorrelation occurs at a rate expressible in terms of this measure. Strong decorrelation occurs for all positive irrationals, except possibly Liouville numbers. We show that for irrationals with a prescribed irrationality measure function $ψ$, decorrelation can be quantified in terms of $ψ^{-1}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a finite subset of an abelian group $G$, and suppose that $|A+A|\leq K|A|$. We show that for any $ε>0$, there exists a constant $C_ε$ such that $A$ can be covered by at most $\exp(C_ε\log(2K)^{1+ε})$ translates of a convex coset progression with dimension at most $C_ε\log(2K)^{1+ε}$ and size at most $\exp(C_ε\log(2K)^{1+ε})|A|$. This falls just short of the Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture, which asserts that this statement is true for $ε=0$, and improves on results of Sanders and Konyagin, who showed that this statement is true for all $ε>2$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study the framed rook algebra, a structure that unifies two significant generalizations of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra. The first one, introduced by Solomon, extends the Hecke algebra to the full matrix monoid, yielding the rook monoid algebra. The second one, developed by Yokonuma, replaces the Borel subgroup with the unipotent subgroup, resulting in the Yokonuma-Hecke algebra. Our concrete algebra is constructed from the double cosets of the unipotent subgroup within the full matrix monoid. We show that this double coset decomposition is indexed by the framed symmetric inverse monoid. We also define the Rook Yokonuma-Hecke algebra as an abstract structure using generators and relations. We then prove the main isomorphism theorem, which establishes that this abstract algebra is isomorphic to the framed rook algebra under a specific parameter specialization. To complete our characterization, we provide a faithful representation on a tensor space and establish a linear basis for the Rook Yokonuma-Hecke algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine the spaces of states of the two-dimensional $O(n)$ and $Q$-state Potts models with generic parameters $n,Q\in \mathbb{C}$ as representations of their known symmetry algebras. While the relevant representations of the conformal algebra were recently worked out, it remained to determine the action of the global symmetry groups: the orthogonal group for the $O(n)$ model, and the symmetric group $S_Q$ for the $Q$-state Potts model. We do this by two independent methods. First we compute the twisted torus partition functions of the models at criticality. The twist in question is the insertion of a group element along one cycle of the torus: this breaks modular invariance, but allows the partition function to have a unique decomposition into characters of irreducible representations of the global symmetry group. Our second method reduces the problem to determining branching rules of certain diagram algebras. For the $O(n)$ model, we decompose representations of the Brauer algebra into representations of its unoriented Jones--Temperley--Lieb subalgebra. For the $Q$-state Potts model, we decompose representations of the partition algebra into representations of the appropriate subalgebra. We find explicit expressions for these decompositions as sums over certain sets of diagrams, and over standard Young tableaux. We check that both methods agree in many cases. Moreover, our spaces of states are consistent with recent bootstrap results on four-point functions of the corresponding CFTs.</p></details>

We then use the method of Taylor and Wiles to verify the $λ$-part of the Tamagawa number conjecture of Bloch and Kato for $L(A,0)$ and $L(A,1)$. Here $λ$ is any prime of $K$ not dividing $Nk!$, and so that the mod $λ$ representation associated to $f$ is absolutely irreducible when restricted to the Galois group over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{(-1)^{(\ell-1)/2}\ell})$ where $λ\mid \ell$. The method also establishes modularity of all lifts of the mod $λ$ representation which are crystalline of Hodge-Tate type $(0,k-1)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Diophantine equation $a^5+b^5=c^5+d^5$ subject to the linear constraint $(c+d)-(a+b)=h$. We establish the necessary modular condition $30 \mid h$ and focus on the first admissible slice $h=30$. The problem reduces to finding rational sections on a genus-one fibration over $\mathbb{Q}(S)$, which need not admit a section. We explicitly construct the associated Jacobian elliptic surface $E/\mathbb{Q}(S)$. By exploiting a global rational $2$-torsion point and applying the Gusić-Tadić injectivity criterion for the specialization homomorphism, we prove the upper bound $\mathrm{rank}\,E(\mathbb{Q}(S))\le 1$. This result severely restricts the possible structure of infinite families of integer solutions within the slice.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Continued fractions have been long studied due to their strong properties, such as rational approximation. In this extent, their arithmetic over real numbers has represented an intriguing problem throughout the years. In this paper, we develop the arithmetic of continued fractions over the field of $p$-adic numbers. In particular, we provide a complete methodology to compute the $p$-adic continued fraction of the Möbius transformation and the bilinear fractional transformation of $p$-adic numbers. These allow any standard arithmetic operation over $p$-adic numbers to be performed. In great contrast with real continued fractions, we prove that the knowledge of arbitrarily many partial quotients of the initial continued fractions is not always sufficient to recover some partial quotients of the transformations. However, we prove that the set of elements for which this is not possible has Haar measure zero in $\mathbb{Q}_p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $d\ge3$ and $\mathbb{F}_q^{\,d}$ be the $d$-dimensional vector space over a finite field of order $q$, where $q$ is an odd prime power. Let $X_π$ be the set of lines through the origin intersecting the slice $π\cap S^{d-1}$, where $π=\{x_d=λ\}$ and $S^{d-1}=\{x:\|x\|=1\}$. For $E\subset\mathbb{F}_q^{\,d}$ and $N\ge1$, we study the exceptional sets $$ T_1(X_π,E,N)=\bigl\{V\in X_π:\ |π_V(E)|\le N\bigr\},\qquad T_2(X_π,E,N)=\bigl\{V\in X_π:\ |π_{V^\perp}(E)|\le N\bigr\}, $$ with their respective natural ranges of $N$. Using discrete Fourier analysis together with restriction/extension estimates for cone and sphere-type quadrics over finite fields, we obtain sharp upper bounds (up to constant factors) for $\lvert T_1\rvert$ and $\lvert T_2\rvert$, with separate analyses for the cases $λ\in \{0, \pm 1\}$. The bounds exhibit arithmetic-geometric dichotomies absent in the full Grassmannian: the quadratic character of $λ^{2}-1$ and the parity of $d$ determine the size of the exceptional sets. As an application, when $|E|\ge q$, there exists a positive proportion of elements $\mathbf{y}\in π\cap S^{d-1}$ such that the pinned dot-product sets $\{\mathbf{y}\cdot \mathbf{x}\colon \mathbf{x}\in E\}$ have cardinality $Ω(q)$. We further study analogous families arising from the spheres of radii $0$ and $-1$, and, by combining the results, recover the known estimates for projections over the full Grassmannian, complementing a result of Chen (2018).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Quantum cat maps are toy models in quantum chaos associated to hyperbolic symplectic matrices $A\in \mathrm{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{Z})$. The macroscopic limits of sequences of eigenfunctions of a quantum cat map are characterized by semiclassical measures on the torus $\mathbb{R}^{2n}/\mathbb{Z}^{2n}$. We show that if the characteristic polynomial of every power $A^k$ is irreducible over the rationals, then every semiclassical measure has full support. The proof uses an earlier strategy of Dyatlov-Jézéquel [arXiv:2108.10463] and the higher-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle of Cohen [arXiv:2305.05022]. Our irreducibility condition is generically true, in fact we show that asymptotically for $100\%$ of matrices $A$, the Galois group of the characteristic polynomial of $A$ is $S_2 \wr S_n$. When the irreducibility condition does not hold, we show that a semiclassical measure cannot be supported on a finite union of parallel non-coisotropic subtori. On the other hand, we give examples of semiclassical measures supported on the union of two transversal symplectic subtori for $n=2$, inspired by the work of Faure-Nonnenmacher-De Bièvre [arXiv:nlin/0207060] in the case $n=1$. This is complementary to the examples by Kelmer [arXiv:math-ph/0510079] of semiclassical measures supported on a single coisotropic subtorus.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The principal aim of this paper is to establish a purity theorem for Mahler functions that is reminiscent of famous purity theorems for G-functions by D. and G. Chudnovsky and for E-functions (and, more generally, for holonomic arithmetic Gevrey series) by Y. Andr{é}. Our approach is based on a preliminary study of independent interest of the nature of the solutions of Mahler equations. Roughly speaking, we prove a reduction result for Mahler systems, implying that any Mahler equation admits a complete basis of solutions formed of what we call generalized Mahler series. These are sums involving Puiseux series, Hahn series of a very special type and solutions of inhomogeneous equations of order 1 with constant coefficients. In the light of B. Adamczewski, J. P. Bell and D. Smertnig's recent height gap theorem, we introduce a natural filtration on the set of generalized Mahler series according to the arithmetic growth of the coefficients of the Puiseux series involved in their decomposition. This filtration has five pieces. Our purity theorem states that the membership of a generalized Mahler series to one of the three largest pieces of this filtration propagates to any other generalized Mahler series solution of its minimal Mahler equation. We also show that this statement does not extend to the smallest two pieces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper establishes several fundamental structural properties of the $q$-Heisenberg algebra $\mathfrak{h}_n(q)$, a quantum deformation of the classical Heisenberg algebra. We first prove that when $q$ is not a root of unity, the global homological dimension of $\mathfrak{h}_n(q)$ is exactly $3n$, while it becomes infinite when $q$ is a root of unity. We then demonstrate the rigidity of its iterated Ore extension structure, showing that any such presentation is essentially unique up to permutation and scaling of variables. The graded automorphism group is completely determined to be isomorphic to $(\mathbb{C}^*)^{2n} \rtimes S_n$. Furthermore, $\mathfrak{h}_n(q)$ is shown to possess a universal deformation property as the canonical PBW-preserving deformation of the classical Heisenberg algebra $\mathfrak{h}_n(1)$. We compute its Hilbert series as $(1-t)^{-3n}$, confirming polynomial growth of degree $3n$, and establish that its Gelfand--Kirillov dimension coincides with its classical Krull dimension. These results are extended to a generalized multi-parameter version $\mathfrak{H}_n(\mathbf{Q})$, and illustrated through detailed examples and applications in representation theory and deformation quantization.</p></details>

Here we consider the restricted count $π_ν(x,y)$ for integers lying in the short interval $(x,x+y]$. In this setting, we show that for any $\varepsilon >0$, the asymptotic equivalence $$ π_ν(x,y) \sim y δ_ν(x)$$ holds uniformly over all $1 \le ν\le (\log x)^{1/3}/(\log \log x)^2$ and all $x^{17/30 + \varepsilon} \leq y \leq x$. The methods also furnish mean upper bounds for the $k$-fold divisor function $τ_k$ in short intervals, with strong uniformity in $k$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\kl_n(a,b;m)$ be the hyper-Kloosterman sum. Fix integers $n\geqslant2,a\neq0$, $b\neq0$ and $k\geqslant2$. For any $0\neqη\in\mathbb{C}$ and multiplicative function $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, we prove that $\kl_n(a,b;m)\neqηf(m)$ holds for $100\%$ square-free $k$-almost prime numbers $m$ and $100\%$ square-free numbers $m$. Counterintuitively, if $\kl_n(a,b;p)=ηf(p)$ holds for all but finitely many primes $p$, we further show that \begin{align*} \ab|\{m\leqslant X:\kl_n(a,b;m)=ηf(m), m \text{ square-free }k\text{-almost prime}\}|= O(X^{1-\frac{1}{k+1}}). \end{align*} These results overturn the general belief that $\kl_n(a,b;m)$ is nearly multiplicative in $m$, and that its distribution at almost prime moduli $m$ closely approximates that at primes. Moreover, we prove that these results also hold for general algebraic exponential sums satisfying some natural conditions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the BPS decomposition theorem (a.k.a. cohomological integrality theorem) decomposing the cohomology of smooth symmetric stacks into the Weyl-invariant part of the cohomological Hall induction of the intersection cohomology of good moduli spaces. As a consequence, we establish the BPS decomposition theorem for the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks and for the critical cohomology of symmetric $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks, thereby generalizing the main result of Bu--Davison--Ibáñez Nuñez--Kinjo--Pădurariu to the non-orthogonal setting. We will present three applications of our main result. First, we confirm Halpern-Leistner's conjecture on the purity of the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks admitting proper good moduli spaces, extending Davison's work on the moduli stack of objects in $2$-Calabi--Yau categories. Second, we prove versions of Kirwan surjectivity for the critical cohomology of symmetric $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks and for the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks. Finally, by applying our main result to the character stacks associated with compact oriented $3$-manifolds, we reduce the quantum geometric Langlands duality conjecture for $3$-manifolds, as formulated by Safronov, from an isomorphism between infinite-dimensional critical cohomologies to a comparison of finite-dimensional BPS cohomologies.</p></details>

Under the conjecture, a Fekete-Szego-type approximation argument produces a polynomial "large" relative to the regular function, which in turn yields continuum many distinct regular functions. We also introduce a formula for the pushforward by a holomorphic function of the equilibrium Green's functions for our bordered Riemann surface with boundary, a formula which has constant term related to Arakelov degree.</p></details>

To establish this result, we apply the Hecke integration formula and subconvexity bounds on Dedekind zeta functions of cyclotomic fields.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The purpose of this paper is to study motivic aspects of the Hitchin system for $\mathrm{GL}_n$. Our results include the following. (a) We prove the motivic decomposition conjecture of Corti-Hanamura for the Hitchin system; in particular, the decomposition theorem associated with the Hitchin system is induced by algebraic cycles. This yields an unconditional construction of the motivic perverse filtration for the Hitchin system, which lifts the cohomological/sheaf-theoretic perverse filtration. (b) We prove that the inverse of the relative Hard Lefschetz symmetry is induced by a relative algebraic correspondence, confirming the relative Lefschetz standard conjecture for the Hitchin system. (c) We show a strong perversity bound for the normalized Chern classes of a universal bundle with respect to the motivic perverse filtration; this specializes to the sheaf-theoretic result obtained earlier by Maulik-Shen. (d) We prove a $χ$-independence result for the relative Chow motives associated with Hitchin systems. Our methods combine Fourier transforms for compactified Jacobian fibrations associated with integral locally planar curves, nearby and vanishing cycle techniques, and a Springer-theoretic interpretation of parabolic Hitchin moduli spaces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, assuming the weak Schanuel Conjecture (WSC), we prove that for any collection of pairwise non-arithmetically equivalent totally real number fields, the residues at $s=1$ of their Dedekind zeta functions form a linearly independent set over the field of algebraic numbers. As a corollary, we obtain that, under WSC, two totally real number fields have the same regulator if and only if they have the same class number and Dedekind zeta function. We also prove that, under WSC, the isometry and similarity classes of the log unit lattice of a real Galois number field of degree $[K:\Q]\geq 4$, characterize the isomorphism class of said field. All of our results follow from establishing that, under WSC, any Gram matrix of the log unit lattice of a real Galois number field yields a generic point of certain closed irreducible $\Q$-subvariety of the space of symmetric matrices of appropriate size.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a sharp, quantitative analogue of Helgason's conjecture at the level of distributions: For a semisimple Lie group $G$ of real rank one, Poisson transforms map a Sobolev space on $P\backslash G$ boundedly with closed range to an $L^2$-space on $K\backslash G$. The result is obtained for the Poisson transform studied by Knapp-Wallach under the name Szegö map, and the appropriate Sobolev spaces are defined using van Erp-Yuncken's Heisenberg calculus. The proof generalizes to show that commutators of this Poisson transform with smooth functions on the Furstenberg compactification are compact. This proves the remaining open conjecture in Julg's seminal program to establish the Baum-Connes conjecture for closed subgroups of semisimple Lie groups of real rank one.</p></details>

We resolve a recent question of Zantema and Bosma about linear subsequences of $k$-automatic sequences with input in most-significant-digit-first format. We also discuss the state complexity and runtime complexity of using a reasonable interpretation of Büchi arithmetic to actually construct some of the studied automata recognizing relations or carrying out operations on automatic sequences.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We discuss the holographic correspondence between 3d "Chern-Simons gravity" and an ensemble of 2d Narain code CFTs. Starting from 3d abelian Chern-Simons theory, we construct an ensemble of boundary CFTs defined by gauging all possible maximal subgroups of the bulk one-form symmetry. Each maximal non-anomalous subgroup is isomorphic to a classical even self-dual error-correcting code over $\mathbb Z_p\times \mathbb Z_p$, providing a way to define a boundary "code CFT." The average over the ensemble of such theories is holographically dual to Chern-Simons gravity, a bulk theory summed over 3d topologies sharing the same boundary. In the case of prime $p$, the sum reduces to that over handlebodies, i.e. becomes the Poincaré series akin to that in semiclassical gravity. As the main result of the paper, we show that the mathematical identity underlying this holographic duality can be understood and rigorously proven using the framework of Howe duality over finite fields. This framework is concerned with the representation theory of two commuting groups forming a dual pair: the symplectic group of modular transformations of the boundary, and an orthogonal group mapping codes to each other. Finally, we reformulate the holographic duality as an identity between different averages over quantum stabilizer states, providing an interpretation in terms of quantum information theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a continuous version of preprojective algebras of type $A$. In particular, we are interested in the preprojective category over an open, bounded subinterval $\mathbb{I}$ of $\mathbb{R}$, denoted $Λ_{\mathbb{I}}$. We study the representable projective modules and define a useful type of sub- and quotient module called decorous modules. These are completely described by a function from the closure $\overline{\mathbb{I}}$ of $\mathbb{I}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ whose 'slopes' are not too steep anywhere. We later use these to describe permuton ideals, a generalization of the support $τ$-tilting ideals of preprojective algebras of type $A_n$, which we call permutation ideals. Once we have our generalization, we show that permutation ideals can be recovered from permuton ideals. Moreover, permutation ideals are $τ$-rigid and we show an analogous property for our permuton ideals. Along the way, we classify all the brick $Λ_{\mathbb{I}}$-modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Division polynomials associated to an elliptic curve $E/K$ are polynomials $φ_n, ψ_n^2$ that arise from the sequence of points $\{nP\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ on this curve. If one wishes to study $\mathbb{Z}$--linear combination of points on $E(K)$, we can use net polynomials $Φ_{v}, Ψ_{v}^2$ which are higher--dimensional analogue of division polynomials. It turns out they are also elliptic nets, an $n$--dimensional array with values in $K$ satisfying the same nonlinear recurrence relation that division polynomials do as well. Now further assume the elliptic curve $E/K$ has complex multiplication by an order of a quadratic imaginary field $F \subseteq K$, we will prove a formula for the common valuation of $Φ_{v}$ and $Ψ_{v}^2$ associated to multiples of points by elements of an order in $F$. As an application, we will use the formula to show that elliptic divisibility sequences associated to multiples of points indexed by elements of an order also satisfy a recurrence relation when indexed by elements of an order, subject to certain conditions on the indices. Additionally, we also expect that the formula may also be used in computing $\mathcal{O}_K$--integral points of an elliptic curve of rank $2$ with complex multiplication (this is future work).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the holomorphic solutions of Picard-Fuchs differential equations associated with one-parameter families of abelian varieties with real multiplication admit power series expansions with $S$-integral coefficients at a maximal unipotent monodromy point. This extends classical integrality results for hypergeometric functions and Bouw-Möller's work on Teichmüller curves. The integral solutions are related to the non-ordinary locus of the modulo $p$ reduction of the family, whose cardinality we bound in terms of the Euler characteristic and Lyapunov exponents of the base curve. In some cases, the non-ordinary locus can be recovered by truncating the integral solutions, as in Igusa's classical observation for the Legendre family. We also establish $S$-integrality of expansions of modular forms at cusps in terms of a modular function for (not necessarily arithmetic) Fuchsian groups with modular embeddings, and deduce congruences. These results are applied in subsequent work to construct lifts of partial Hasse invariants for rational curves in Hilbert modular varieties.</p></details>

In this article, we first construct a $p$-adic distribution $L^{\mathrm{As}}_{p}(Ψ)$ that interpolates the twisted critical $L$-values of Asai (or twisted tensor) $L$-function of $Ψ$, generalizing the works of Loeffler--Williams from the ordinary case to the non-ordinary case. To obtain this distribution, we construct some polynomials using Asai--Eisenstein elements: the Betti analogue of the Euler system machinery, developed by Loeffler--Williams. We use some techniques analogous to those of Loeffler--Zerbes for interpolating the twists of Beilinson--Flach elements arising in the Euler system associated with Rankin--Selberg convolutions of elliptic modular forms. We also use the interpolation method developed by Amice--Vélu, Perrin-Riou, and Büyükboduk--Lei in the construction. Furthermore, under some assumptions, we decompose these unbounded $p$-adic distributions into the linear combination of bounded measures as done by Pollack, Sprung, and Lei--Loeffler--Zerbes in the elliptic modular forms case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p\geq 3$ be a prime number and $K$ be a quadratic imaginary field in which $p$ splits as $\mathfrak{p}\overline{\mathfrak{p}}$. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a cuspidal Bianchi eigenform over $K$ of weight $(k,k)$, where $k\geq 0$ is an integer, level $\mathfrak{m}$ coprime to $p$, and non-ordinary at both of the primes above $p$. We assume $\mathcal{F}$ has trivial nebentypus. For $\mathfrak{q}\in\{\mathfrak{p}, \overline{\mathfrak{p}}\}$, let $a_{\mathfrak{q}}$ be the $T_{\mathfrak{q}}$ Hecke eigenvalue of $\mathcal{F}$ and let $α_{\mathfrak{q}},β_{\mathfrak{q}}$ be the roots of polynomial $X^{2} -a_{\mathfrak{q}}X+ p^{k+1}$. Then we have four $p$-stabilizations of $\mathcal{F}$: $\mathcal{F}^{α_{\mathfrak{p}},α_{\overline{\mathfrak{p}}}}, \mathcal{F}^{α_{\mathfrak{p}},β_{\overline{\mathfrak{p}}}}, \mathcal{F}^{β_{\mathfrak{p}},α_{\overline{\mathfrak{p}}}},$ and $ \mathcal{F}^{β_{\mathfrak{p}},β_{\overline{\mathfrak{p}}}}$ which are Bianchi cuspforms of level $p\mathfrak{m}$. By the works of Williams, to each $p$-stabilization $\mathcal{F}^{*,\dagger}$, we can attach a locally analytic distribution $L_{p}(\mathcal{F}^{*,\dagger})$ over the ray class group $\text{Cl}(K,p^{\infty})$. On viewing $L_{p}(\mathcal{F}^{*,\dagger})$ as a two-variable power series with coefficients in some $p$-adic field having unbounded denominators satisfying certain growth conditions, we decompose this power series into a linear combination of power series with bounded coefficients in the spirit of Pollack, Sprung, and Lei--Loeffler--Zerbes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a filtration by ideals on quantum cohomology for symplectic manifolds with a Hamiltonian $S^1$-action that extends to a pseudoholomorphic $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. These spaces include all Conical Symplectic Resolutions, in particular all Quiver Varieties. In particular, we obtain a family of filtrations on singular cohomology for any Conical Symplectic Resolution, that is sensitive to the choice of $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. The symplectic form is rarely exact at infinity for these spaces, so substantial foundational work is carried out to rigorously define Floer theory, in particular symplectic cohomology. Using Floer theory, we construct a periodic persistence module, giving rise to a graded periodic barcode associated to the $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This encodes birth-death phenomena of Floer invariants. Our filtrations can be viewed as a Floer-theoretic analogue of Atiyah-Bott filtrations, arising from stratifying a manifold by gradient flowlines of a Morse-Bott function, but they are distinct from those and they can detect non-topological properties of the quantum product.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper introduces and systematically studies a new class of non-commutative algebras -- Weyl-type and Witt-type algebras -- generated by differential operators with exponential and generalized power function coefficients. We define the expolynomial ring $R_{p,t,\mathcal{A}} = \mathbb{F}\bigl[ e^{\pm x^{p} e^{t}},\; e^{\mathcal{A} x},\; x^{\mathcal{A}} \bigr]$ associated to an additive subgroup $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathbb{F}$, and investigate its Ore extension $A_{p,t,\mathcal{A}} = R_{p,t,\mathcal{A}}[\partial; δ]$ (Weyl-type) and its derivation algebra $\mathfrak{g}_{p,t,\mathcal{A}} = \mathrm{Der}_{\mathbb{F}}(R_{p,t,\mathcal{A}})$ (Witt-type). Our main results establish: (1) the automorphism group of $R_{p,t,\mathcal{A}}$ is isomorphic to $(\mathbb{F}^{\times})^{2r+1} \rtimes \mathrm{GL}(2r+1,\mathbb{Z})$; (2) a Galois descent theorem showing that fixed-point subalgebras under finite Galois actions recover the original Weyl-type algebra; (3) the non-existence of finite-dimensional simple modules for $A_{p,t,\mathcal{A}}$; (4) the Zariski density of isomorphism classes in moduli spaces as transcendental parameters vary; (5) the stability of simplicity under generic quantum deformation; and (6) a complete representation-theoretic framework including the classification of irreducible weight modules, the construction of Harish--Chandra modules with BGG-type resolutions, and the structure of category $\mathcal{O}$. These results unify and extend classical theories of Weyl algebras, Witt algebras, and generalized Weyl algebras, while opening new directions in deformation theory, non-commutative geometry, and the representation theory of infinite-dimensional algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using Morse-Bott-Floer spectral sequences, we describe a filtration by ideals on quantum cohomology for symplectic manifolds with a Hamiltonian $S^1$-action that extends to a pseudoholomorphic $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. These spaces include all Conical Symplectic Resolutions, in particular all Quiver Varieties. Our spectral sequences give explicit descriptions of birth-death phenomena of the barcode of the persistence module associated to the $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This paper contains the foundational work to rigorously construct a filtration on Floer complexes from the $\mathbb{C}^*$-action, announced in our earlier paper. A substantial appendix on Morse-Bott-Floer theory deals with several of the technical difficulties of the paper. We compute a plethora of explicit examples, each highlighting various features, for Springer resolutions, ADE resolutions, and several Slodowy varieties of type A. We also consider certain Higgs moduli spaces, for which we compare our filtration with the famous P=W filtration.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The aim of this paper is to classify reduction types of algebraic curves. Reduction types capture the discrete invariants of fibres in one-dimensional families of curves, and they have been described in genus 1, 2 and 3. For fixed genus g>1, they form finitely many families, and we explain how to construct them, and introduce a naming convention.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cluster algebras, introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky through the process of quiver mutation, have become central objects in modern algebra and geometry, linking combinatorial constructions with diverse mathematical domains such as Teichmuller theory, total positivity, and even theoretical physics. Building on foundational work by Fomin, Shapiro, and Thurston connecting cluster algebras to triangulated surfaces, recent research has extended mutation theory to infinite settings, including the infinity-gon and more general marked surfaces. In this paper, we develop a purely combinatorial framework for mutation of infinite quivers, independent of but compatible with these topological constructions. By formalizing infinite quivers as limits of embedded finite quivers, we establish a consistent definition of mutation that generalizes prior surface-based results. We then apply this framework to extend the notion of reddening sequences, special mutation sequences with significant algebraic consequences, from the finite to the infinite setting. Our approach not only unifies previous topological and combinatorial perspectives but also provides a technical foundation for further generalizations of cluster algebra theory in the infinite case.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Improved Version (v2)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider infinite sequences of positive numbers. The connection between log-concavity and the Bessenrodt--Ono inequality had been in the focus of several papers. This has applications in the white noise distribution theory and combinatorics. We improve a recent result of Benfield and Roy and show that for the sequence of partition numbers $\{p(n)\}$ Nicolas' log-concavity result implies the result of Bessenrodt and Ono towards $p(n) \, p(m) > p(n+m)$. We provide several examples. Benfield and Roy gave a conjecture related to $\ell $-ary partition numbers. We prove part of this conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We adapt Caro's notion of overholonomicity to give a definition of holonomic D-cap-modules on rigid analytic spaces. We prove stability under five of the six operations (both inverse image functors, duality, and both direct image functors for projective morphisms), as well as base change results. Up to the open problem of stability under tensor products, we obtain an analogue of the usual six-functor formalism for holonomic D-modules.</p></details>
