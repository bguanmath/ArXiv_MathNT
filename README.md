<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the existence of abelian varieties over $\overline{\mathbb Q(t)}$ with no power isogenous to a Jacobian. Moreover, given a positive integer $N$, we prove the existence of abelian varieties over $\overline{\mathbb Q(t)}$ with maximal monodromy such that the $n$th power is not isogenous to a Jacobian for $n \leq N$. We make use of an Arakelov inequality established by Lu and Zuo, as well as intersection theoretic methods, to prove our main results.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Arvind Kumar, Ariel Weiss &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f$ and $f'$ be genus $2$ cuspidal Siegel paramodular newforms. We prove that if their Hecke eigenvalues $a_p$ and $a_p'$ satisfy a non-trivial polynomial relation $P(a_p, a_p') = 0$ for a set of primes $p$ of positive density, then $f$ is a scalar multiple of a quadratic twist of $f'$. This result extends the strong multiplicity one theorem, which handles the case $P(x,y) = x - y$, to arbitrary polynomial relations. Our proof analyses the image of the product Galois representation attached to the pair $(f, f')$: we show that this image is as large as possible, unless $f$ is a twist of $f'$. Our results also apply to elliptic modular forms. They therefore provide a unified method for distinguishing both elliptic and Siegel modular forms based on their Hecke data, including their Hecke eigenvalues, Satake parameters, Sato--Tate angles, and the coefficients of their $L$-functions. We apply our methods to recover and generalise a range of existing results and to prove new ones in both the elliptic and Siegel settings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We solve the classical and quantum problems for the 1D sigma model with target space the flag manifold $\mathrm{U}(3)\over \mathrm{U}(1)^3$, equipped with the most general invariant metric. In particular, we explicitly describe all geodesics in terms of elliptic functions and demonstrate that the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator may be found by solving polynomial (Bethe) equations. The main technical tool that we use is a mapping between the sigma model and a Gaudin model, which is also shown to hold in the $\mathrm{U}(n)$ case.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Wing Hong Leung, Matthew P. Young &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 35 pages, 2 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a power-saving bound for certain smoothed shifted convolution sums for Fourier coefficients of Siegel cusp forms. This result is the first nontrivial estimate for a shifted convolution sum with two cusp forms on a group of higher rank than $\GL_2$. Our approach is based on a novel automorphic reinterpretation of the delta method of Duke, Friedlander, and Iwaniec. The method reduces the problem to the estimation of Fourier coefficients of Siegel Poincare series, which is ultimately based on the Weil bound.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Long version of a paper from SODA 2016

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we provide details on the proofs of the quantum polynomial time algorithm of Biasse and Song (SODA 16) for computing the $S$-unit group of a number field. This algorithm directly implies polynomial time methods to calculate class groups, S-class groups, relative class group and the unit group, ray class groups, solve the principal ideal problem, solve certain norm equations, and decompose ideal classes in the ideal class group. Additionally, combined with a result of Cramer, Ducas, Peikert and Regev (Eurocrypt 2016), the resolution of the principal ideal problem allows one to find short generators of a principal ideal. Likewise, methods due to Cramer, Ducas and Wesolowski (Eurocrypt 2017) use the resolution of the principal ideal problem and the decomposition of ideal classes to find so-called ``mildly short vectors'' in ideal lattices of cyclotomic fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove Witten zeta function of a root system $Φ$ has high-order vanishing at negative even integers, using an integral representation involving the Hurwitz zeta function. This settles a conjecture of Kurokawa and Ochiai for a large class of compact Lie groups. We also provide a qualitative description of the corresponding leading coefficient in terms of Riemann zeta values, in which the highest root of $Φ$ makes a natural appearance.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Erik P. van den Ban &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 83 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a complete proof of the Maass-Selberg relations for Whittaker integrals on a real reductive group. These relations were asserted In unpublished work of Harish-Chandra, and proven in the basic setting of maximal parabolic parabolic subgroups. Our proof is a reduction to the mentioned basic setting. It makes use of the action of standard intertwining operators on Whittaker distribution vectors in the generalized principal series of representations. The Maass-Selberg relations imply regularity of normalized Whittaker integrals. This is crucial for decent behavior of Fourier and wave packet transforms on the level of spherical Schwartz spaces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Since their introduction, torsion theories have played a key role in the study of abelian and pointed categories. In representation theory, torsion theories and lattices of torsion classes of mod$ A$, for $A$ a finite-dimensional algebra, have been widely studied. The more recent definition of pretorsion theories, that can be given for any category, has expanded the theory, giving many more instances of ``non-pointed torsion theories'' in unexpected settings. In this work, we introduce and study the lattice $\mathcal{L}_t(A)$ of pretorsion classes of mod$ A$. These lattices are in close connection with the lattices tors$ A$ of torsion classes of mod$ A$. We fully describe the completely join-irreducible elements of $\mathcal{L}_t(A)$. Moreover, we characterise and give a full classification of when $\mathcal{L}_t(A)$ is distributive and further describe when it can be identified with the \emph{distributive closure} of tors$ A$. Finally, we show how the lattices of pretorsion classes, together with their duals, can be used to build pretorsion theories in mod$ A$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kazuki Hiroe &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unfolding singular points in linear differential equations is a classical technique for studying the properties of irregular singularities by relating them to regular singularities. In this paper, we propose a general framework for unfolding unramified irregular singularities of meromorphic connections on the trivial principal $G$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. One of our main results is the description of the unfolding of singularities in terms of deformations of their moduli spaces. We show that every moduli space of irreducible meromorphic $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ can be deformed into a moduli space of irreducible Fuchsian $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. Furthermore, we study the unfolding of additive Deligne-Simpson problems, in which the unfolding of irregular singularities naturally generates a family of such problems. As an application of our main result, we prove that a Deligne-Simpson problem for $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities admits a solution if and only if every unfolded Deligne-Simpson problem in the family admits a simultaneous solution. We also provide a combinatorial and diagrammatic framework of the unfolding process in terms of spectral types and unfolding diagrams. Finally, we address a conjecture proposed by Oshima concerning the existence of irreducible $G$-connections that realize prescribed spectral types and their unfoldings. Our main result gives an affirmative answer to this conjecture.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This version has improved exposition in many places, including a significantly revised introduction. 25 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the study of minimal torsion curves within a fixed geometric isogeny class. For a $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-isogeny class $\mathcal{E}$ of elliptic curves and $N \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, we wish to determine the least degree of a point on the modular curve $X_1(N)$ associated to any $E \in \mathcal{E}$. In the present work, we consider the cases where $\mathcal{E}$ is rational, i.e., contains an elliptic curve with rational $j$-invariant, or where $\mathcal{E}$ consists of elliptic curves with complex multiplication (CM). If $N=\ell^k$ is a power of a single prime, we give a complete characterization upon restricting to points of odd degree, and also in the case where $\mathcal{E}$ is CM. We include various partial results in the more general setting.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Blas Fernández, Jae-Ho Lee, Jongyook Park &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $Γ$ denote a distance-regular graph with vertex set $X$ and diameter $D \geq 3$. Fix a vertex $x \in X$. Let the field $\mathbb{F}$ be either $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. Let $\mathrm{Mat}_X(\mathbb{F})$ denote the $\mathbb{F}$-algebra of matrices whose rows and columns are indexed by $X$ and all entries in $\mathbb{F}$. The Terwilliger algebra $T^\mathbb{F} = T^\mathbb{F}(x)$ is the subalgebra of $\mathrm{Mat}_X(\mathbb{F})$ generated by the adjacency matrix $A$ of $Γ$ and the dual primitive idempotents $\{E_i^*\}_{i=0}^D$ of $Γ$ with respect to $x$. Let $\{E_i\}_{i=0}^D$ denote the primitive idempotents of $A$. Assume that the ordering $\{E_i\}_{i=0}^D$ is $Q$-polynomial. Let $W$ denote an irreducible $T^\mathbb{F}$-module. We say that $W$ is sharp over $\mathbb{F}$ whenever $\dim (E_r^* W) = 1$, where $r$ is the endpoint of $W$. It is known, by Nomura and Terwilliger (2008), that every irreducible $T^\mathbb{C}$-module is sharp. In this paper, we prove that every irreducible $T^\mathbb{R}$-module is sharp. Once this is established, we obtain four additional results: (i) if $W$ is an irreducible $T^\mathbb{R}$-module, then its complexification $W^\mathbb{C}= W \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C}$ is an irreducible $T^\mathbb{C}$-module; (ii) two irreducible $T^\mathbb{R}$-modules $W_1$ and $W_2$ are isomorphic if and only if their complexifications $W_1^\mathbb{C}$ and $W_2^\mathbb{C}$ are isomorphic as $T^\mathbb{C}$-modules; (iii) if $\bigoplus_{i=1}^h \mathrm{Mat}_{n_i}(\mathbb{C})$ is the Wedderburn decomposition of $T^\mathbb{C}$, then $\bigoplus_{i=1}^h \mathrm{Mat}_{n_i}(\mathbb{R})$ is the Wedderburn decomposition of $T^\mathbb{R}$; (iv) each of the subalgebras $E_1^* T E_1^*$, $E_1 T E_1$, $E_D^* T E_D^*$, and $E_D T E_D$ is commutative and every element of these algebras is a symmetric matrix.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the dimensions of $\text{GL}_N$-skein modules of genus-one mapping tori $T^2\times_γS^1$, for an arbitrary diffeomorphism of $T^2$, and for generic quantum parameter. These are most cleanly expressed via a generating function over all $N$, which we dub the skein partition function, and for which we compute an explicit Euler product expansion.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 29 pages. This is a revision of the part on stable equivalences in arXiv:2312.08794. New results are added. We stress that every finite-dimensional algebra over a field R is isomorphic to the centralizer of two matrices in a full matrix algebra over the field R. Thus the class of all centralizers of one matrix is an impotent part of finite-dimensonal algebras over fields

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As is known, every finite-dimensional algebra over a field is isomorphic to the centralizer algebra of two matrices. So it is fundamental to study first the centralizer algebra of a single matrix, called a centralizer matrix algebra. In this article, stable equivalences between centralizer matrix algebras over arbitrary fields are completely characterized in terms of a new equivalence relation on matrices. Moreover, stable equivalences of centralizer matrix algebras over perfect fields induce stable equivalences of Morita type, thus preserve dominant, finitistic and global dimensions. Our methods also show that algebras stably equivalent to a centralizer matrix algebra over a field have the same number of non-isomorphic, non-projective simple modules. Thus the Auslander--Reiten conjecture on stable equivalences holds true for centralizer matrix algebras.</p></details>

Let $\mathcal C$ be a functorially finite exact subcategory of $Λ$-mod with enough projective and injective objects and $\mathcal S (\mathcal C)$ be its monomorphism category. It turns out that the category $\mathcal S (\mathcal C)$ has almost split sequences. We show an explicit formula for the Auslander-Reiten translation in $\mathcal S (\mathcal C)$. Furthermore, if $\mathcal C$ is a stably $d$-Calabi-Yau Frobenius category, we calculate objects under powers of Auslander-Reiten translation in the triangulated category $\overline{\mathcal S(\mathcal C)}$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Wei-Ping Li, Qingyuan Jiang, Yu Zhao &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Vafa-Witten observed that Yoshioka's blow-up formula for the Euler characteristics of rank $r$ instantons on an algebraic surface coincides with the character of the Wess-Zumino-Witten model for $\mathrm{SU}(r)$ at level $1$, and raised the question of finding a rational conformal field theory explanation for this striking coincidence. In this work, we provide an answer to this question by constructing and analyzing the affine $\mathrm{gl}_r$ action on various cohomology theories, including the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves, Hochschild homology, Chow groups, and Hodge cohomology, of the moduli space of stable sheaves on a blown-up surface. A key ingredient in our proof is a representation-theoretic reformulation of the theory of Grassmannians of Tor-amplitude $[0,1]$-perfect complexes studied by the first-named author in terms of the spin representation of the finite-dimensional Clifford algebra. This may be viewed as a finite analog of the question of Vafa-Witten via the Boson-Fermion correspondence.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Details added in various sections

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For all infinite rings $R$ that are finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}$, we show that Hilbert's tenth problem has a negative answer. This is accomplished by constructing elliptic curves $E$ without rank growth in certain quadratic extensions $L/K$. To achieve such a result unconditionally, our key innovation is to use elliptic curves $E$ with full rational $2$-torsion which allows us to combine techniques from additive combinatorics with $2$-descent.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Mahler equations arise in a wide range of contexts including the study of finite automata, regular sequences, algebraic series over Fp(z), and periods of Drinfeld modules. Introduced a century ago by K. Mahler to study the transcendence of certain complex numbers, they have recently been the subject of several works establishing a deep connection between such transcendence properties and the nature of their solutions. While numerous studies have investigated these solutions, existing algorithms can only compute them in specific rings: rational functions, power series, Puiseux series, or Hahn series. This paper solves the problem by providing an algorithm that computes a complete basis of solutions for any Mahler equation, along with a decomposition of each solution over the field of Puiseux series. Along the way, we describe an algorithm that computes a fundamental matrix of solutions for any Mahler system.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given an elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ and non-zero integer $r$, the Lang--Trotter conjecture predicts a striking asymptotic formula for the number of good primes $p\leqslant x$, denoted by $π_{E,r}(x)$, such that the Frobenius trace of $E$ at $p$ is equal to the given integer $r$. We focus on the CM case in this memoir, and show how to realize the following two goals: (1) to give an unconditional estimate for $π_{E,r}(x)$, which confirms the upper bound part of the conjecture up to a constant multiple; (2) to give a conditional explicit asymptotic formula for $π_{E,r}(x)$ based on the Hardy--Littlewood conjecture on primes represented by quadratic polynomials. For completeness, we also summarize classical results on quadratic, cubic and quartic residues, as well as the corresponding reciprocity laws. This part should be of independent interests and could provide useful materials for more junior readers. We also highlight some possible extensions of the arguments in this memoir that may work for other statistical problems of CM elliptic curves.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Denote by $π(x;q,a)$ the number of primes $p\leqslant x$ with $p\equiv a\bmod q.$ We prove new upper bounds for $π(x;q,a)$ when $q$ is a large prime very close to $\sqrt{x}$, improving upon the classical work of Iwaniec (1982). The proof reduces to bounding a quintilinear sum of Kloosterman sums, to which we introduce a new shifting argument inspired by Vinogradov--Burgess--Karatsuba, going beyond the classical Fourier-analytic approach thanks to a deep algebro-geometric result of Kowalski--Michel--Sawin on sums of products of Kloosterman sums.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we construct an arithmetic hyperbolic $6-$orbifold $\mathcal{O}$ such that, any square-rootable Salem number of degree at most $4$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is realized as the exponential of the length of a closed geodesic in $\mathcal{O}$. We also prove that $n=6$ is the minimal dimension among arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds of the first type where it can be obtained. In an appendix, we establish a general relation between the discriminant of a Salem number and the determinant of a quadratic space which realizes it. In particular, for any $m,d>0$ we present a geometric proof of the existence of Salem numbers of degree $2m$ with discriminant $(-1)^{m+1}d$ in $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}/\mathbb{Q}^{\times 2}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Vertex algebras (and their modules) can be described as vector spaces together with a linear operator-valued series in one parameter $z$. With the interpretation of $z$ as a coordinate at a point on a curve, one can construct algebraic structures on the moduli space of curves from $V$-modules. Here we propose a generalization of vertex algebras involving linear operators in parameters $z_1,\ldots,z_n$. One may interpret these as being the components of a set of coordinates on an $n$-dimensional algebraic variety. These are referred to as cohomological vertex algebras (CVAs): the formal punctured 1-disk underlying a vertex algebra is replaced by a ring modeling the cohomology of certain modifications of the formal $n$-disk. We prove several structural theorems for CVAs and give a definition of cohomological vertex operator algebras (CVOAs). Using a reconstruction theorem for CVAs, we provide basic examples such as the $βγ$-system, the Heisenberg CVA, and the affine Kac-Moody CVAs. We use these constructions to describe BRST reduction, leading to an analog of W-algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a new quadratic Chabauty method to compute the integral points on certain even degree hyperelliptic curves. Our approach relies on a nontrivial degree zero divisor supported at the two points at infinity to restrict the $p$-adic height to a linear function; we can then express this restriction in terms of holomorphic Coleman integrals under the standard quadratic Chabauty assumption. Then we use this linear relation to extract the integral points on the curve. We also generalize our method to integral points over number fields. Our method is significantly simpler and faster than all other existing versions of the quadratic Chabauty method. We give examples over $\Q$ and $\Q(\sqrt{7})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is an introduction to the finite groups, with focus on the groups of permutations and reflections, and more generally, on the finite groups of unitary matrices. We first discuss the basics of group theory, featuring the cyclic, dihedral and symmetric groups, and the structure result for finite abelian groups. Then we study the complex reflection groups, with general theory and examples, classification results, and with a look into braid groups too. We then go into the study of representation theory, and of more advanced aspects, such as Tannakian duality, Brauer theorems and Clebsch-Gordan rules. Finally, we discuss, using representation theory methods, a number of advanced analytic aspects, for the most in relation with questions coming from probability.</p></details>

This improves a recent result of Tsuda. We also demonstrate that a straightforward application of the Maynard-Tao method is insufficient to improve this bound. However, it allows us to establish the existence of bounded gaps between Goldbach primes with bounded error for almost all even integers $N$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1973 Montgomery formulated the pair correlation conjecture, predicting that the local spacing statistics of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function coincide with those of eigenvalues of large Hermitian matrices from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). The zeta function, however, is a fixed deterministic object, and the mechanism by which its zeros reproduce random matrix statistics has remained unclear. In this paper, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we prove Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of Hardy's $Z$-function. Building on earlier works, we use a finite-dimensional variational space of sections $Z_N(t;a)$ that approximate $Z(t)$ on each window $[2N,2N+2]$. Inside this space we define the real hall $\mathcal{RH}_N(\mathbb{R})$, consisting of those sections whose zeros in the corresponding critical rectangle are real, simple, and remain so along any homotopy from the core section. This real hall plays the role of a random matrix ensemble. Equipping it with a probability measure with smooth, strictly positive density on the coefficient space, we construct a Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equation with reflection at the discriminant boundary. We show that the induced dynamics of the unfolded zeros are, in the bulk, equivalent in law to Dyson Brownian motion with $β=2$, and by invoking modern universality results for Dyson Brownian motion and log-gases we obtain that, for any such measure, the ensemble-averaged local pair-correlation converges to the GUE sine-kernel law. Finally, using Selberg's probabilistic theory of the argument $S(t)$, we prove that the pair-correlation observables of the canonical approximants $Z_N(t;1)$ over disjoint windows behave asymptotically like decorrelated samples drawn from this GUE-distributed ensemble, and we upgrade the averaged GUE law to a deterministic pair-correlation law for the zeros of $Z(t)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(a_n)_{n \geq 1}$ be a sequence of distinct positive integers. The metric theory of minimal gaps for the sequence $\{αa_n \text{ mod }1, 1\leq n \leq N\}$ as $N \to \infty$ was initiated by Rudnick, who established that the minimal gap admits an asymptotic upper bound expressible in terms of the additive energy of $\{a_1,\ldots,a_N\}$ for almost every $α$. Later, Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch demonstrated that the metric theory of minimal gaps for such sequences is governed not by the additive energy, but by the cardinality of the difference set of $\{a_1,\ldots,a_N\}$. They established a sharp convergence test for the typical asymptotic order of the minimal gap and proved general upper and lower bounds that are readily applicable. A key element of their proof relies on the resolution of the Duffin--Schaeffer conjecture by Koukoulopoulos and Maynard. In this article, we generalise several results from the article of Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch on \emph{integer} sequences to the case of \emph{real} sequences. While an upper bound for $δ_{\min}^α(N)$ remains elusive, we obtain one for its floored counterpart $\lfloor δ^α_{\min} \rfloor (N)$ for real sequences $(a_n)_{n \geq 1}$ of distinct numbers. Our theorems recover Theorems 1-3, as well as the result from Section 4.3 of the article by Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds for the minimal gaps of well-spaced sequences and, more generally, of a broader family that contains them.</p></details>

A finite collection of elements from $G$, where the order is disregarded and repetitions are allowed, is said to be a product-one sequence if its elements can be ordered such that their product in $G$ equals the identity element of $G$. Then, the Gao's constant $\mathsf E (G)$ of $G$ is the smallest integer $\ell$ such that every sequence of length at least $\ell$ has a product-one subsequence of length $|G|$. For a positive integer $n$, we denote by $C_n$ a cyclic group of order $n$. Let $G = C_n \rtimes_s C_2$ with $s^2\equiv 1\pmod n$ be a metacyclic group. The direct and inverse problems of $\mathsf E (G)$ were settled recently, except for the case that $G=C_{3n_2}\rtimes_s C_2$ with $n_2\neq 1$, $\gcd(n_2,6)=1$, $s\equiv -1 \pmod 3$, and $s\equiv 1\pmod {n_2}$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Riemann-Hilbert method is employed to carry out an asymptotic analysis of a family of $σ$-Painlevé V functions associated with Hankel determinants involving the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind. In the large-matrix limit, this family degenerates to a family of $σ$-Painlevé III$'$ functions, whose precise asymptotic behavior is also obtained. Both families of Painlevé functions arise in the study of the joint moments of the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of a CUE random matrix and the polynomial itself, whose asymptotics are closely related to the moments of the Riemann zeta function and the Hardy $\mathsf{Z}$-function on the critical line.

We explain why this terminology is deserved and calculate the factorization homology of $\mathrm{Rep}_q(\check T)$. When $M$ arises from a global complex curve, we confirm (a version of) a conjecture of Ben-Zvi and Nadler for tori.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Dey and Xin (J.Appl.Comput.Top., 2022, arXiv:1904.03766) describe an algorithm to decompose finitely presented multiparameter persistence modules using a matrix reduction algorithm. Their algorithm only works for modules whose generators and relations are distinctly graded. We extend their approach to work on \emph{all} finitely presented modules and introduce several improvements that lead to significant speed-ups in practice. Our algorithm is fixed parameter tractable with respect to the maximal number of relations with the same degree and with further optimisation we obtain an $O(n^3)$ algorithm for interval-decomposable modules. In particular, we can decide interval-decomposability in this time. As a by-product to the proofs of correctness we develop a theory of parameter restriction for persistence modules. Our algorithm is implemented as a software library \textsc{aida} which is the first to enable the decomposition of large inputs. We show its capabilities via extensive experimental evaluation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be an abelian variety defined over a number field $K$ and $\hat{h}$ be the Néron-Tate height on $A(\overline{K})$ corresponding to a symmetric ample line bundle on $A$. Let $\mathcal{K}/K$ be an asymptotically positive infinite extension as defined in \cite{AB-SK} which includes infinite Galois extensions with finite local degree at a non-archimedean place. In this article, we prove that the Néron-Tate height of non-torsion points in $A(\mathcal{K})$ is bounded below by an absolute constant depending only on $A$, $K$, and $\mathcal{K}$. As a consequence, we obtain the Bogomolov property for totally $p$-adic points of an abelian variety $A/\mathbb{Q}$ in the case when $A$ has good reduction at $p$. This is the first instance where such a result has been obtained in the good reduction case; previously, it was known only in the bad reduction case via Gubler's tropical equidistribution theorem. Moreover, our result also implies the finiteness of torsion points in $A(\mathcal{K})$.</p></details>

Furthermore, we show that a component of some affine Deligne--Lusztig variety $X^0_{w_r}(b)_{\mathcal{L}}$ for $\mathrm{GSp}$ can be written, up to perfection, as a direct product of a classical Deligne--Lusztig variety with an affine space. We also study the varieties $X_h$ defined by Chan and Ivanov, and show that $X_h$ at infinite level can be realized as a subset of semi-infinite Deligne--Lusztig varieties defined using components of affine Deligne--Lusztig varieties such as $X^0_{w_r}(b)_{\mathcal{L}}$ above, even in the $\mathrm{GSp}$ case. This reinterprets previous constructions of representations from $X_h$ as instances of Lusztig's conjectural picture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using the subdivision schemes theory, we develop a criterion to check if any natural number has at most one representation in the $n$-ary number system with a set of non-negative integer digits $A=\{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n\}$ that contains zero. This uniqueness property is shown to be equivalent to a certain restriction on the roots of the trigonometric polynomial $\sum_{k=1}^n e^{-2πi a_k t}$. From this criterion, under a natural condition of irreducibility for $A$, we deduce that in case of prime $n$ the uniqueness holds if and only if the digits of $A$ are distinct modulo $n$, whereas for any composite $n$ we show that the latter condition is not necessary. We also establish the connection of this uniqueness to the semigroup freeness problem for affine integer functions of equal integer slope; this together with the two criteria allows to fill the gap in the work of D. Klarner on the question of P. Erdös about densities of affine integer orbits and establish a simple algorithm to check the freeness and the positivity of density when the slope is a prime number.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a finite group and $K$ a field containing an element of multiplicative order $|G|$. It is shown that if $G$ has a cyclic subgroup of index at most $2$, then the separating Noether number over $K$ of $G$ coincides with the Noether number over $K$ of $G$. The same conclusion holds when $G$ is the direct product of a dihedral group and the $2$-element group. On the other hand, the smallest non-abelian groups $G$ are found for which the separating Noether number over $K$ is strictly less than the Noether number over $K$. Along the way the exact value of the separating Noether number is determined for all groups of order at most $16$. The results show in particular that unlike the ordinary Noether number, the separating Noether number of a non-abelian finite group may well be equal to the separating Noether number of a proper direct factor of the group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the problem of representing the fraction $5/P$ as a sum of three distinct unit fractions $1/A+1/B+1/C$ with $A<B<C$ and $A,B,C\in\mathbb{N}$. The case of primes $P\equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ is analyzed, where two constructive types of solutions arise: ED1 (exactly one denominator divisible by $P$, namely $C=cP$) and ED2 (exactly two denominators divisible by $P$, namely $B=bP$ and $C=cP$). Parametric constructions and enumeration algorithms are developed, including explicit transitions between ED1 and ED2. A deterministic algorithm is proposed, based on the intersection of a parametric lattice defined by pairs $(α,d')$ with bounded boxes. For each fixed prime $P\equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ the algorithm constructively produces a solution. Using analytic methods such as the Bombieri--Vinogradov theorem and the Chebotarev density theorem, it is shown that the density of admissible parameters is high, which yields polylogarithmic search complexity in the average case. A strict complexity guarantee for all primes remains conditional and depends on the finite covering hypothesis. This study extends previous work for coefficient $4$ (the Erdős--Straus conjecture) to coefficient $5$, transferring the same structure of parametrization and constructive solutions. Analytic applications provide averaging tools used for density estimates in parametric boxes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The VC-dimension, introduced by Vapnik and Chervonenkis in 1968 in the context of learning theory, has in recent years provided a rich source of problems in combinatorial geometry. Given $E\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$ or $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, finding lower bounds on the VC-dimension of hypothesis classes defined by geometric objects such as spheres and hyperplanes is equivalent to constructing appropriate geometric configurations in $E$. The complexity of these configurations increases exponentially with the VC-dimension. These questions are related to the Erdős distance problem and the Falconer problem when considering a hypothesis class defined by spheres. In particular, the Erdős distance problem over finite fields is equivalent to showing that the VC-dimension of translates of a sphere of radius $t$ is at least one for all nonzero $t\in \mathbb{F}_q$. In this paper, we show that many of the existing techniques for distance problems over finite fields can be extended to a much broader context, not relying on the specific geometry of circles and spheres. We provide a unified framework which allows us to simultaneously study highly structured sets such as algebraic curves, as well as random sets.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a set of generators for the space of Eisenstein series of even weight $k$ for any congruence group $Γ$ and study the set of all of their zeros taken for $Γ(1)$-conjugates of $Γ$ in the standard fundamental domain for $Γ(1)$. We describe (a) an upper bound $κ_Γ+ O(1/k)$ for their imaginary part; (b) a finite configuration of geodesics segments to which all zeros converge in Hausdorff distance as $k \rightarrow \infty$; (c) a finite set containing all algebraic zeros for all weights. The bound in (a) depends on the (non-)vanishing of a new generalization of Ramanujan sums. The proof of (b) originates in a method used to study phase transitions in statistical physics. The proof of (c) relies on the theory of complex multiplication. The results can be made quantitative for specific groups. For $Γ=Γ(N)$ with $4 \nmid N$, $κ_Γ=1$ and the zeros tend to the unit circle, whereas if $4 \mid N$, $κ_Γ=2$ and the limit configuration includes parts of vertical geodesics and circles of radius $2$. In both cases, the only algebraic zeros are at $\mathrm{i}$ and $\exp(2π\mathrm{i}/3)$ for sufficiently large $k$. For $Γ(N)$ with $N$ odd, we use finer estimates to prove a trichotomy for the exact `convergence speed' of the zeros to the unit circle, as well as angular equidistribution of the zeros as $k \rightarrow \infty$.</p></details>

Then we prove that the Q-Classification Conjecture holds if $q=p$ is a prime such that $24{,}504{,}480$ does not divide $p^2-1$. More generally, for any integer $d$, we reduce the Q-Classification Conjecture for all primes $p\not\equiv \pm 1\,\text{mod}\,d$ to checking whether a roughly $2d\times 2d$ matrix with entries in $\mathbb{Q}[κ]$ is invertible.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Grothendieck-Serre conjecture predicts that every generically trivial torsor under a reductive group $G$ over a regular semilocal ring $R$ is trivial. We establish this for unramified $R$ granted that $G^{\mathrm{ad}}$ is totally isotropic, that is, has a "maximally transversal" parabolic $R$-subgroup. We also use purity for the Brauer group to reduce the conjecture for unramified $R$ to simply connected $G$--a much less direct such reduction of Panin had been a step in solving the equal characteristic case of Grothendieck-Serre. We base the group-theoretic aspects of our arguments on the geometry of the stack $\mathrm{Bun}_G$, instead of the affine Grassmannian used previously, and we quickly reprove the crucial weak $\mathbb{P}^1$-invariance input: for any reductive group $H$ over a semilocal ring $A$, every $H$-torsor $\mathscr{E}$ on $\mathbb{P}^1_A$ satisfies $\mathscr{E}|_{\{t = 0\}} \simeq \mathscr{E}|_{\{t = \infty\}}$. For the geometric aspects, we develop reembedding and excision techniques for relative curves with finiteness weakened to quasi-finiteness, thus overcoming a known obstacle in mixed characteristic, and show that every generically trivial torsor over $R$ under a totally isotropic $G$ trivializes over every affine open of $\mathrm{Spec}(R) \setminus Z$ for some closed $Z$ of codimension $\ge 2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine the structure of the BPS algebra of 2-Calabi-Yau Abelian categories for which the stack of objects admits a good moduli space. We prove that this algebra is isomorphic to the positive part of the enveloping algebra of a generalised Kac-Moody Lie algebra generated by the intersection cohomology of certain connected components (corresponding to roots) of the good moduli space. Some major examples include the BPS algebras of (1) the category of semistable coherent sheaves of given slope on a K3 surface or, more generally, quasiprojective symplectic surface, (2) semistable Higgs bundles on a smooth projective curve, (3) preprojective algebras of quivers, (4) multiplicative preprojective algebras and (5) fundamental groups of (quiver) Riemann surfaces. We define the BPS Lie algebras of 2-Calabi-Yau categories and prove that they coincide with the ones obtained by dimensional reduction from the critical cohomological Hall algebra in the case in which the 2-Calabi-Yau category is the category of representations of a preprojective algebra. Consequences include (1) A proof in full generality of the Bozec-Schiffmann positivity conjecture for absolutely cuspidal polynomials, a strengthening of the Kac positivity conjecture (2) A proof of the cohomological integrality conjecture for the category of semistable coherent sheaves on local K3 surfaces (3) A description of the cohomology (in all degrees) of Nakajima quiver varieties as direct sums of irreducible lowest weight representations over the BPS Lie algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define and study a sheaf-theoretic cohomological Hall algebra for suitably geometric Abelian categories $\mathcal{A}$ of homological dimension at most two, and a sheaf-theoretic BPS algebra under the conditions that $\mathcal{A}$ is 2-Calabi-Yau and has a good moduli space. We show that the BPS algebra for the preprojective algebra $Π_Q$ of a totally negative quiver is the free algebra generated by the intersection cohomology of the closure of the locus parameterising simple $Π_Q$-modules in the coarse moduli space. We define and study the BPS Lie algebra of arbitrary 2-Calabi-Yau categories $\mathcal{A}$ for which the Euler form is negative on all pairs of non-zero objects, which recovers the BPS algebra as its universal enveloping algebra for such "totally negative" 2CY categories. We show that for totally negative 2CY categories the BPS algebra is freely generated by intersection complexes of certain coarse moduli spaces as above, and the Borel-Moore homology of the stack of objects in such $\mathcal{A}$ satisfies a Yangian-type PBW theorem for the BPS Lie algebra. In this way we prove the cohomological integrality theorem for these categories. We use our results to prove that for $C$ a smooth projective curve, and for $r$ and $d$ not necessarily coprime, there is a nonabelian Hodge isomorphism between the Borel-Moore homologies of the stack of rank $r$ and degree $d$ Higgs bundles, and the appropriate stack of twisted representations of the fundamental group of $C$. In addition we prove the Bozec-Schiffmann positivity conjecture for totally negative quivers; we prove that their polynomials counting cuspidal functions in the constructible Hall algebra for $Q$ have positive coefficients, strengthening the positivity theorem for the Kac polynomials of such quivers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For primes $p$ and $\ell$ such that $\ell$ divides $p-1$, Hirano and Morishita constructed a nonabelian Galois extension of the function field $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$ whose degree is $\ell^3$ and Galois group is of Heisenberg type. Here we analyze how primes of degree one decompose in such extensions. It amounts to investigating the decomposition of the principal ideal $(t-a)$ for $a \in \mathbb{F}_p-\{0,1\}$ and our main result determines when it decomposes completely in terms of an explicit polynomial in $a$. It is reminiscent of Euler's criterion. The proof relies on both the group structure of the mod-$\ell$ Heisenberg group and the arithmetic of field extensions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We generalize the theory of integer $C$-, $G$-matrices in cluster algebras to the real case. By a skew-symmetrizing method, we can reduce the problem of skew-symmetrizable patterns to the one of skew-symmetric patterns. In this sense, we extend the sign-coherence of integer $C$-, $G$-matrices proved by Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich to a more general real class called of quasi-integer type. Furthermore, we give a complete classification of this type by a combinatorial method of real weighted quivers. However, the sign-coherence of real $C$-, $G$-matrices does not always hold in general. For this purpose, we classify all the rank $2$ case and the finite type case via the Coxeter diagrams. We also give two conjectures about the real exchange matrices and $C$-, $G$-matrices. Under these conjectures, the dual mutation, $G$-fan structure and synchronicity property hold. As an application, the isomorphism of several kinds of exchange graphs is studied.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Assuming the Riemann Hypothesis (RH), Montgomery proved a theorem in 1973 concerning the pair correlation of zeros of the Riemann zeta-function and applied this to prove that at least $2/3$ of the zeros are simple. In this paper, we investigate the versatility of the pair correlation method and show, for the first time, that it can be used to prove results on the \emph{horizontal distribution} of zeros of the Riemann zeta-function. In earlier work we showed how to remove RH from Montgomery's theorem and, in turn, obtain results on simple zeros assuming conditions on the zeros that are weaker than RH. Here we assume a more general condition, namely that all the zeros $ρ= β+iγ$ with $T<γ\le 2T$ are in a narrow vertical box centered on the critical line with width $b/\log T$, where $b\to 0$ as $T\to \infty$. We first prove the generalization of Montgomery's result that at least $2/3$ of zeros are simple, and we then prove the new result that the pair correlation method yields at least $2/3$ of the zeros on the critical line. We also use the pair correlation method to prove that at least $1/3$ of the zeros are both simple and on the critical line, a result already known unconditionally using different methods.</p></details>

Further, we show that for $b\geq 2$ there are infinitely many palindromes (with $n=\overleftarrow{n}$) that are cube-free. We also give asymptotic expressions for the counting functions corresponding to these results. The main tools we use are recent bounds from the literature on reversed primes and palindromes in arithmetic progressions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A famous conjecture of Erd\H os and Straus is that for every integer $n\ge2$, $4/n$ can be represented as $1/x+1/y+1/z$, where $x,y,z$ are positive integers. This conjecture was generalized to $5/n$ by Sierpiński, and then Schinzel conjectured that for every integer $m\ge4$ there is a bound $n_m$ such that the fraction $m/n$ is the sum of 3 unit fractions for all integers $n\ge n_m$. Leveraging and generalizing work of Elsholtz and Tao, we show that if $n_m$ exists it must be at least $\exp(m^{1/3+o(1)})$; that is, there are numbers $n$ this large for which $m/n$ is not the sum of 3 unit fractions. We prove a weaker, but numerically explicit version of this theorem, showing that for $m\ge 6.52\times10^9$ there is a prime $p\in(m^2,2m^2)$ with $m/p$ not the sum of 3 unit fractions, and report on some extensive numerical calculations that support this assertion with the much smaller bound $m\ge19$. In addition we generalize a result of Vaughan to show that for each $m$, most $n$'s have $m/n$ representable, and we prove a result generalizing the problem to the sum of $j$ unit fractions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the \textit{Fibonacci Quarterly} in 1964, C.~R.~Wall gave the following weighted sum of generalized Fibonacci numbers: $\sum_{i=1}^n i G_i = n G_{n+2} - G_{n+3} + G_3$, where $\left(G_n\right)_{n \geq 0}$ is defined by the recurrence $G_n = G_{n-1} + G_{n-2}$ with fixed $G_0, G_1 \in \mathbb{Z}$. In this paper, we generalize Wall's result to the Lucas sequences of the first and second kind, $\left(U_n(p,q)\right)_{n \geq 0}$ and $\left(V_n(p,q)\right)_{n \geq 0}$, and give closed forms for $\sum_{i=1}^n i U_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n i V_i$ by using Abel's summation by parts method. Moreover, we provide concrete applications, not only recovering the known weighted sums $\sum_{i=1}^n i F_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n i L_i$ of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, respectively, but also add new identities to the literature for eight well-known sequences. In particular, we give closed forms for weighted sums of Lucas sequences of the first kind such as the Pell, balancing, Jacobstahl, and Mersenne numbers, and also Lucas sequences of the second kind such as the companion Pell, double Lucas-balancing, Jacobstahl-Lucas, and Mersenne-Lucas numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a determinantal, Toda-type, presentation for the equivariant K theory of a partial flag variety ${\rm Fl}(r_1, \dots, r_k;n)$. The proof relies on pushing forward the Toda presentation obtained by Maeno, Naito and Sagaki for the complete flag variety ${\rm Fl}(n)$, via Kato's ${\rm K}_T({\rm pt})$-algebra homomorphism from the quantum K ring of ${\rm Fl}(n)$ to that of ${\rm Fl}(r_1, \dots, r_k;n)$. Starting instead from the Whitney presentation for ${\rm Fl}(n)$, we show that the same pushforward technique gives a recursive formula for polynomial representatives of quantum K Schubert classes in any partial flag variety which do not depend on quantum parameters. In an appendix, we include another proof of the Toda presentation for the equivariant quantum K ring of ${\rm Fl}(n)$, following Anderson, Chen, and Tseng, which is based on the fact that the ${\rm K}$-theoretic $J$-function is an eigenfunction of the finite difference Toda Hamiltonians.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Root vectors in quantum groups (of finite type) generalize to fused currents in quantum loop groups ([5]). In the present paper, we construct fused currents as duals to specialization maps of the corresponding shuffle algebras ([7,8,9]) in types ADE. Both root vectors and fused currents depend on a convex order of the positive roots, and the choice we make in the present paper is that of the Auslander-Reiten order ([24]) corresponding to an orientation of the type ADE Dynkin diagram.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The lonely runner conjecture of Wills and Cusick asserts that if $n$ runners with distinct constant speeds run around a a circular unit length track, starting at a common time and place, then each runner will at some time be separated by a distance of at least $\frac{1}{n}$ from all other runners. A weaker lower bound of $\frac{1}{2n-2}$ follows from the so-called trivial union bound, and subsequent work upgraded this to bounds of the form $\frac{1}{2n}+\frac{c}{n^2}$ for various constants $c>0$. Tao strengthened this to $\frac{1}{2n}+\frac{(\log n)^{1-o(1)}}{n^2}$. In this paper, we obtain a polynomial improvement of the form $$\frac{1}{2n}+\frac{1}{n^{5/3+o(1)}}.$$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates the conditions under which a given circular (synchronizing) DFA is \emph{simple} (sometimes referred to as \emph{primitive}) and when it is \emph{irreducible}. Our notion of irreducibility slightly differs from the classical one, since we are considering our monoid representations to be over $\mathbb{C}$ instead of $\mathbb{Q}$; nevertheless, several well-known results remain valid-for instance, the fact that every irreducible automaton is necessarily simple. We provide a complete characterization of simplicity in the circular case by means of the \emph{weak contracting property}. Furthermore, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for a circular \emph{contracting automaton} (a stronger condition than the weakly contracting one) to be irreducible, and we present examples illustrating our results.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study a new restricted family of overpartitions, called block-separated overpartitions, in which no two consecutive distinct part-size blocks may both be overlined. Using a two-state transfer-matrix automaton, we derive a closed matrix-product expression for the ordinary generating function, establish an Euler-type factorization, and obtain an explicit normalized recurrence suitable for computation of arbitrary coefficients. We further prove that the possible overlining patterns on the distinct blocks are counted by Fibonacci numbers, giving natural bijections with independent sets on paths, pattern-avoiding binary words, and Fibonacci tilings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $x\geqslant 2$ and assume that $a$ and $q$ are coprime positive integers. As usual, $ψ(x;q,a):=\sum_{n\leqslant x,n\equiv a(\!\!\!\mod{\!\!q})}Λ(n)$, where $Λ$ is the von Mangoldt function. In 2003, Friedlander and Iwaniec assumed the existence of exceptional characters corresponding to "extreme" Landau-Siegel zeroes and established a meaningful asymptotic formula for $ψ(x;q,a)$ beyond the square-root barrier of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. In particular, their asymptotic yields non-trivial information for moduli $q\leqslant x^{1/2+1/231}$. In this paper, we considerably relax the extremity of the Landau-Siegel zero required in the work of Friedlander and Iwaniec and obtain a conditional asymptotic formula for $ψ(x;q,a)$ in a slightly wider range of $q$.</p></details>
