<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Half a century ago Manin showed that given a number field $k$ and a rational prime $\ell$, there exists a uniform bound for the order of cyclic $\ell$-power isogenies between two non-CM elliptic curves over $k$. We generalize this to certain $2$-dimensional families of abelian $3$-folds with multiplication by an imaginary quadratic field.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the existence of "murmurations" in the family of holomorphic modular forms of level $1$ and weight $k\to\infty$, that is, correlations between their root numbers and Hecke eigenvalues at primes growing in proportion to the analytic conductor. This is the first demonstration of murmurations in an archimedean family.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 9 pages, accepted for publication in "Research in Number Theory"

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present two distinct families of imaginary biquadratic fields, each of which contains infinitely many members, with each member having large class groups. Construction of the first family involves elliptic curves and their quadratic twists, whereas to find the other family, we use a combination of elliptic and hyperelliptic curves. Two main results are used, one from Soleng and the other from Banerjee and Hoque.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kaidi Wu, Hongfeng Zhang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** We modify some details. Comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop the Bernstein-Zelevinsky theory for quasi-split real classical groups and employ this framework to establish an Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic formula for general linear groups. The key to our approach is establishing the Casselman-Wallach property for the homology of the Jacquet functor, which also provides an affirmative resolution to an open question proposed by A. Aizenbud, D. Gourevitch and S. Sahi. Furthermore, we prove the vanishing of higher extension groups for arbitrary pairs of generic representations, confirming a conjecture of Dipendra Prasad. We also utilize the Bernstein-Zelevinsky theory to establish two additional results: the Leibniz law for the highest derivative and a unitarity criterion for general linear groups. Lastly, we apply the Bernstein-Zelevinsky theory to prove the Hausdorffness and exactness of the twisted homology of split even orthogonal groups.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Duc Hieu Le &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Proofs in this paper were AI-generated and I just found out some of them were incorrect. Therefore, I would like to withdraw it

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We settle 22 conjectures of Cohen about cyclic numbers (positive integers $n$ with $\gcd(n,\varphi(n))=1$), proving 16 and disproving 6, and we completely resolve a related OEIS problem about sequences whose running averages are Fibonacci numbers. Highlights include: asymptotics for cyclics between consecutive squares with a second-order term (Conj.~9), Legendre- and $k$-fold Oppermann-type results in short quadratic intervals (Conj.~6, Conj.~20, and twin cyclics between cubes, Conj.~32), gap and growth analogs (Visser, Rosser, Ishikawa, and a sum-3-versus-sum-2 inequality; Conj.~47,~52,~54,~56), limiting ratios (Vrba and Hassani; Conj.~60,~61), and structure results for Sophie Germain cyclics (Conj.~36,~37). We also resolve two Firoozbakht-type conjectures for cyclics (Conj.~41--42). On the negative side we exhibit counterexamples to the Panaitopol, Dusart, and Carneiro analogs (Conj.~59,~53,~50--51). Finally, for the lexicographically least sequence of pairwise distinct positive integers whose running averages are Fibonacci numbers (\seqnum{A248982}), we give explicit closed forms for all $n$ and prove Fried's Conjecture~2 asserting the disjointness of the parity-defined value sets (equivalently, $F_{n+2}+2nF_{n+1}$ is never a Fibonacci number). Proofs in this paper were assisted by GPT-5.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04244v2'>2402.04244</a>\]&nbsp; **The spectrum of excisive functors**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gregory Arone, Tobias Barthel, Drew Heard, Beren Sanders &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 90 pages; all comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a thick subcategory theorem for the category of $d$-excisive functors from finite spectra to spectra. This generalizes the Hopkins-Smith thick subcategory theorem (the $d=1$ case) and the $C_2$-equivariant thick subcategory theorem (the $d=2$ case). We obtain our classification theorem by completely computing the Balmer spectrum of compact $d$-excisive functors. A key ingredient is a non-abelian blueshift theorem for the generalized Tate construction associated to the family of non-transitive subgroups of products of symmetric groups. Also important are the techniques of tensor triangular geometry and striking analogies between functor calculus and equivariant homotopy theory. In particular, we introduce a functor calculus analogue of the Burnside ring and describe its Zariski spectrum \`{a} la Dress. The analogy with equivariant homotopy theory is strengthened further through two applications: We explain the effect of changing coefficients from spectra to ${\mathrm{H}\mathbb{Z}}$-modules and we establish a functor calculus analogue of transchromatic Smith-Floyd theory as developed by Kuhn-Lloyd. Our work offers a new perspective on functor calculus which builds upon the previous approaches of Arone-Ching and Glasman.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Michael M. Schein, Re'em Waxman &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 42 pp., comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The submodule structure of mod $p$ principal series representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, for $k$ a finite field of characteristic $p$, was described by Bardoe and Sin and has played an important role in subsequent work on the mod $p$ local Langlands correspondence. The present paper studies the structure of mod $p$ principal series representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathcal{O} / \mathfrak{m}^n)$, where $\mathcal{O}$ is the ring of integers of a $p$-adic field $F$ and $\mathfrak{m}$ its maximal ideal. In particular, the multiset of Jordan-H\"older constituents is determined. In the case $n = 2$, more precise results are obtained. If $F / \mathbb{Q}_p$ is totally ramified, the submodule structure of the principal series is determined completely. Otherwise the submodule structure is infinite. When $F$ is ramified but not totally ramified, the socle and radical filtrations are determined and a specific family of submodules, providing a filtration of the principal series with irreducible quotients, is studied; this family is closely related to the image of a functor of Breuil. In the case of unramified $F$, the structure of a particular submodule of the principal series is studied; this provides a more precise description of the structure of a module constructed by Breuil and Pa\u{s}k\=unas in the context of their work on diagrams giving rise to supersingular mod $p$ representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(F)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Fixed a reference, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\lambda\colon A\rightarrow A^{\vee}$ be a polarization on an abelian variety over a field $k$. If $k$ is not algebraically closed, there might not exist an ample line bundle on $A$ defined over $k$ that represents $\lambda$. To remedy this, Poonen and Stoll have asked the following question: does there exist a line bundle on an $A$-torsor that represents $\lambda$? We give a criterion for the existence of such a torsor and line bundle which only depends on the kernel of $\lambda$. Using this criterion, we show that the answer to the question is yes when the polarization has odd or small even degree. On the other hand, we show that for every $g\geq 7$, there exists a polarized $g$-dimensional abelian variety for which the answer to the question is no.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** James Taylor &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a group acting on a field $L$, and suppose that $L /K$ is a finite Galois extension, where $K = L^G$. We show that the irreducible semilinear representations of $G$ over $L$ can be completely described in terms of irreducible linear representations of $H$, the kernel of $G \rightarrow \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$. When $G$ is finite and $|G| \in L^{\times}$ this provides a character theory for semilinear representations of $G$ over $L$, which recovers ordinary character theory when the action of $G$ on $L$ is trivial.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v5: 34 pages. Revised following referee comments. Final version, to appear in Adv. Math

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of composition series of triangulated categories, which generalizes full exceptional sequences. The lengths of composition series yield invariants for triangulated categories. We study composition series of derived categories for some classes of projective varieties and finite-dimensional algebras. We prove that certain negative rational curves on rational surfaces cause composition series of different lengths in the derived categories of the surfaces. On the other hand, we show that for derived categories of finite-dimensional hereditary algebras, for nontrivial admissible subcategories of ${\rm D}^{\rm b}(\mathbb{P}^2)$ and for derived categories of some singular varieties, all composition series have the same length.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08652v4'>2510.08652</a>\]&nbsp; **Divergent Infinite Series -- Ramanujan's Initial Intuition**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Mario M. Attard &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates Srinivasa Ramanujan's initial intuitive methodology for assigning the finite value -1/12 to the sum of the divergent infinite series of all positive integers. We systematically examine Ramanujan's initial method, originally sketched in his notebooks, and set the methodology into an algebraic framework. The methodology has limited applicability to other classes of divergent series. The methodology is extended to assign a Ramanujan smoothed sum to the infinite sequences of integers raised to a positive integer power and to figurate binomial number sequences, including triangular numbers, tetrahedral numbers, and higher-dimensional analogues, avoiding analytical continuation. A key finding establishes that the Ramanujan smoothed sums of figurate binomial sequences are intrinsically connected to logarithmic numbers (Gregory coefficients), providing a novel perspective on Ramanujan summation through the lens of classical combinatorial functions. The paper applies asymptotic expansions of associated rational generating functions to demonstrate consistency with established results from analytic continuation methods. The results illuminate the deeper mathematical structures underlying Ramanujan's intuitive insights and suggest new avenues for research in divergent series summation.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17293v2'>2402.17293</a>\]&nbsp; **Characterizing higher Auslander(-Gorenstein) Algebras**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zhenhui Ding, Mohammad Hossein Keshavarz, Guodong Zhou &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is well known that for Auslander algebras, the category of all (finitely generated) projective modules is an abelian category and this property of abelianness characterizes Auslander algebras by Tachikawa theorem in 1974. Let $n$ be a positive integer. In this paper, by using torsion theoretic methods, we show that $ n $-Auslander algebras can be characterized by the abelianness of the category of modules with projective dimension less than $ n $ and a certain additional property, extending the classical Auslander-Tachikawa theorem. By Auslander-Iyama correspondence a categorical characterization of the class of Artin algebras having $ n $-cluster tilting modules is obtained. Since higher Auslander algebras are a special case of higher Auslander-Gorenstein algebras, the results are given in the general setting as extending previous results of Kong. Moreover, as an application of some results, we give categorical descriptions for the semisimplicity and selfinjectivity of an Artin algebra. Higher Auslander-Gorenstein Algebras are also studied from the viewpoint of cotorsion pairs and, as application, we show that they satisfy in two nice equivalences.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08926v2'>2207.08926</a>\]&nbsp; **Cohomological Hall algebras, their categorification, and their representations via torsion pairs**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Duiliu-Emanuel Diaconescu, Mauro Porta, Francesco Sala &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** v2: 144 pages. The introduction has been partially rewritten. We have added one part devoted to 2-Segal spaces and representations in broad generality, and another addressing the construction of COHAs and CatHAs associated to dg-categories endowed with t-structures. The main results on representations remain unchanged, as does the section on applications. v1: 68 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we provide a systematic way of producing representations of cohomological, K-theoretical and categorified Hall algebras, and study the output of our construction in several cases. We thus recover and categorify in a unified framework the action of the COHA of a quiver on the cohomology of Nakajima quiver variety, the action of the COHA of zero-dimensional sheaves on the the cohomology of Hilbert schemes of points and moduli spaces of Gieseker-stable sheaves on smooth surfaces, recovering the constructions of Negu\c{t} and DeHority. We also obtain new examples, associated to Pandharipande-Thomas stable pairs. Along the way, we explain carefully under which conditions one can associate to a pair $(\mathscr{C},\tau)$ consisting of a stable $\infty$-category with a t-structure a COHA. This requires a careful analysis and extension of Khan's theory of motivic Borel-Moore homology to the non quasi-compact setting, and it allows to produce new examples of COHAs arising from Bridgeland's stability conditions. The representations that we construct take an extra categorical input: that of a torsion pair $(\mathscr{T},\mathscr{F})$ on the heart $\mathscr{C}^\heartsuit$ of $\tau$. Under favorable conditions, the homology of the moduli stack associated to $\mathscr{T}$ acquires a Hall multiplication, that acts both on the left and on the right on the homology of the moduli stack associated to $\mathscr{F}$. The left action generalizes and categorifies Nakajima's positive operators, while the right action corresponds to negative operators.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Daniele Bartoli, Marco Calderini, Giuseppe Marino, Francesco Pavese &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2021, Calderini et al. introduced a construction for APN functions on $\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}}$ in bivariate form $$ f(x,y)=\big(xy,\, x^{2^r+1} + x^{2^{r+m/2}} y^{2^{m/2}} + bxy^{2^r} + cy^{2^r+1}\big),\quad r < m/2,\quad \gcd(r, m) = 1. $$ They showed that this family exists provided the existence of a polynomial $$ P_{c,b}(X)=(cX^{2^r +1} + b X^{2^r}+1)^{2^{m/2}+1}+X^{2^{m/2}+1}, $$ with no zeros in $\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}}$. For $m\le 6$ it was shown that we can have APN functions belonging to this family. However, up to now, no construction of such polynomials is known for $m\ge 8$. In this work we provide a non-existence result of such functions whenever $r<m/8-1$, by application of techniques from algebraic varieties over finite fields. In particular, for $r=1$ we have that the construction of Calderini et al. cannot provide an APN function for $m\ge 8$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The notion of a Kummer-faithful field, defined by Mochizuki, is expected as one of suitable base fields for anabelian geometry. In this paper, we study Kummer-faithfulness for algebraic extension fields of $p$-adic fields. We show that Kummer-faithfulness for such fields are deeply related with various finiteness properties on torsion points of (semi-)abelian varieties. For example, a Galois extension $K$ of a $p$-adic field is Kummer-faithful with finite residue field if and only if, for any finite extension $L$ of $K$ and any abelian variety over $L$,its $L$-rational torsion subgroup is finite. In addition, we study Kummer-faithfulness for Lubin-Tate extension fields.</p></details>

We show that the Clifford and norm functors provide a discriminant-preserving equivalence of categories between binary quadratic modules and pseudoregular modules over quadratic algebras. This perspective synthesizes the constructions of Kneser and Wood, reconciling algebraic and geometric approaches and clarifying the role of orientations and the natural emergence of narrow class groups. As an application, we restrict to lattices and show that binary orthogonal eigenforms correspond to Hecke characters.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 27 pages. v2:expositions improved

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The authors define a Category $\mathcal{O}$ for any quasi-reductive Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with respect to a triangular decomposition. This much needed approach unifies many important constructions in the existing literature in a rigorous fashion. Our Category $\mathcal{O}$ encompasses all highest weight categories for Lie (super)algebras as well as specific examples which may not be highest weight categories. When the decomposition arises from a principal parabolic subalgebra $\mathfrak{p}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$, the Category $\mathcal{O}$ exhibits rich homological properties. For one, the authors show that in contrast to the case of a semisimple Lie algebra, the Category $\mathcal{O}$ is standardly stratified. Furthermore, the categorical cohomology of $\mathcal{O}$ is a finitely generated ring. This provides a first step towards developing a support variety theory for Category $\mathcal{O}$. It is shown that the complexity of modules in Category $\mathcal{O}$ is finite with an explicit upper bound given by the dimension of the subspace of the odd degree elements in $\mathfrak{g}$. This upgrades results known for $\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$ to the more general setting. Our arguments are based on foundational connections between the categorical cohomology and the relative Lie superalgebra cohomology as well as the interplay between Category $\mathcal{O}$ for $\mathfrak{g}$ and the Category $\mathcal{O}$ for its corresponding Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_{\bar 0}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma = 0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta = 0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $\gamma + \delta/e = \mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $\gamma^{(n)} + \delta^{(n)}/e = \eta^{(n)}$; $n \ge 0$ for sequences of constants $\gamma^{(n)}$, $\delta^{(n)}$, and $\eta^{(n)}$ (given respectively by full, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). We first investigate the $\gamma^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations, revealing that at least one of the pair {$\gamma,\gamma^{(2)}$} and at least two of the set {$\gamma,\gamma^{(n)},\gamma^{(n+1)},\ldots,\gamma^{(2n)}$} (for all $n \ge 2$) are transcendental. This result implies $\Gamma^{(n)}(1)$ is transcendental infinitely often for $n \ge 1$. We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $\eta^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent (and therefore transcendental) for all $n \ge 0$, implying further that at least one of each pair, {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e$} and {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e,\delta^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n \ge 1$. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tilde{\delta}^{(n)}$ and $\tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $\gamma^{(n)} + \tilde{\delta}^{(n)}/e = \tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$.</p></details>

As a corollary, we show that the boundary of the compactified Siegel modular variety satisfies the Grothendieck-Lefschetz condition. This implies, in particular, that formal Siegel modular forms of genus $g\geq2$ are automatically classical Siegel modular forms. Our result generalizes the work of Bruinier and Raum on the modularity of formal Siegel modular forms.</p></details>

While the polynomial algebra \(\langle T \rangle\) is abelian, the enlarged algebra \(\mathcal{A} = \mathrm{span}\{U^a E U^b, U^n\}\) exhibits finite--rank commutators confined to a finite neighborhood of the boundary. We construct explicit site-localized 2-cocycles \(\omega_j(X,Y) = \langle e_j, [X,Y] e_j \rangle\) and prove they form a basis of \(H^2(\mathcal{A},\mathbb{C})\). Quantitative bounds and finite-dimensional models confirm a sharp bulk-edge dichotomy. The framework provides a rigorous Lie-algebraic model for edge phenomena in discrete quantum systems-without violating the Jacobi identity.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for the number of joint orbits of random tuples of commuting permutations. In the uniform sampling case this generalizes the classic CLT of Goncharov for the number of cycles of a single random permutation. We also consider the case where tuples are weighted by a factor other than one, per joint orbit. We view this as an analogue of the Ewens measure, for tuples of commuting permutations, where our CLT generalizes the CLT by Hansen. Our proof uses saddle point analysis, in a context related to the Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotics and the theorem of Meinardus, but concerns a multiple pole situation. The proof is written in a self-contained manner, and hopefully in a manner accessible to a wider audience. We also indicate several open directions of further study related to probability, combinatorics, number theory, an elusive theory of random commuting matrices, and perhaps also geometric group theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The \textit{ternary digits of $2^n$} are a finite sequence of 0s, 1s, and 2s. It is a natural question to ask whether the frequency of any string of 0s, 1s, and 2s in this sequence approaches the same limit for all strings of the same length, as the exponent $n$ approaches infinity (\textit{Uniform Distribution in the limit}). Currently the answer to this question is unknown. Even a much weaker conjecture by Erd\"os is still open. But we present computational results (up to $n = 10^6$) supporting uniform distribution in the limit. In this context, we discuss implications of Benford's Law and a special case of Baker's Theorem. Then we investigate the infinite sequence of ternary digits of $\log_3(2)$. There are analogous questions about the distribution of strings of 0s, 1s, and 2s in that sequence. If there is uniform distribution in the limit, then $\log_3(2)$ is called \textit{normal to base 3}. In the absence of definitive results, we can offer again computational evidence from the first $10^6$ ternary digits of $\log_3(2)$, strongly supporting the conjecture that $\log_3(2)$ is normal to base 3.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical Stern sequence of positive integers was extended to a polynomial sequence $S_n(\lambda)$ by Klav\v{z}ar et. al. by defining $S_0(\lambda) = 0$, $S_1(\lambda) = 1$, and $$S_{2n}(\lambda) = \lambda S_n(\lambda),\quad S_{2n+1}(\lambda) = S_n(\lambda) + S_{n+1}(\lambda).$$ Dilcher et. al. conjectured that all roots of $S_n(\lambda)$ lie in the half-plane $\{\mathrm{Re} w < 1\}$. We make partial progress on this conjecture by proving that $\{|w-2| \leq 1\}\subseteq\mathbb C$ does not contain any roots of $S_n(\lambda)$. Our proof uses the Parabola Theorem for convergence of complex continued fractions. As a corollary, we establish a conjecture of Ulas and Ulas by showing that $S_p(\lambda)$ is irreducible in $\mathbb Z[\lambda]$ whenever $p$ is a positive prime.</p></details>

We investigate their factorization over $\mathbb{Q}$. In the case $a \notin \{0, \pm 1\}$, we ask whether they are irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, prove the irreducibility for several infinite families, and investigate the location of the roots of these polynomials on the complex plane. For $a=\pm1$, the factorization of $K_{a,n}$ is intimately related to that of the Cauchy--Mirimanoff polynomials $E_n$ and the polynomials $T_n$ and $S_n$ introduced by P. Nanninga. After removing the trivial factors $x$, $x-1$, and $x^2-x+1$, the remaining components agree (up to change of variable) with $E_n$, $S_n$, or $T_n$.

We then show that this D-basis is the result of applying Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to the semistandard tableau basis, which identifies a natural inner product on the skew Schur module and recasts straightening as an orthogonal projection.</p></details>

Using our definition of stable geometric transfer factors, we show that the stable transfer conjecture for orbital integrals implies the stable transfer of characters and vice versa. The latter is also implied by local Langlands, and in particular this establishes archimedean stable geometric transfer. Finally, we show how the stable geometric transfer factors can be used to define stable spectral transfer factors.</p></details>

We further establish a map from the $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$ characters to the characters of the $\mathcal{T}_{p, N}$ chiral algebra. We extract the pure part of the mixed Hodge polynomial $PH_c$ of the Coulomb branch compactified on a circle, and prove that $PH_c$ encodes the representation theory of $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the Skolem Problem is decidable in finitely generated commutative rings of positive characteristic. More precisely, we show that there exists an algorithm which, given a finite presentation of a (unitary) commutative ring $\mathcal{R} = \mathbb{Z}_{/T}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]/I$ of characteristic $T > 0$, and a linear recurrence sequence $(\gamma_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in \mathcal{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$, determines whether $(\gamma_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ contains a zero term.

Our result implies, moreover, that the zero set of a linear recurrence sequence over a ring of characteristic $T = p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is effectively a finite union of $p_i$-normal sets in the sense of Derksen (2007).</p></details>

As an application, we deduce that the image of the lift in the degree 4 cohomology of the associated orthogonal Shimura variety has the same dimension as the lifted space of cusp forms. Our results also cover the case of moduli spaces of quasi-polarized K3 surfaces. To prove the injectivity, we introduce vector-valued indefinite Siegel theta functions of genus 2 and of Jacobi type attached to L. We describe their behavior with respect to the split of a hyperbolic plane in L. This generalizes results of Borcherds to genus higher than 1.</p></details>

In this paper, for any prism $S/A$ with a surjection $S\to R$ such that $\widehat{\mathbb L}_{\overline{S}/\overline{A}}$ is a $p$-completely flat module over $\overline{S}$, we establish an equivalence of categories between rational Hodge-Tate crystals on $(R/A)_{\Delta}$ and topologically nilpotent integrable connections on the Hodge--Tate cohomology ring $\overline{\Delta}_{R/S}$. As an application, for a non-zero divisor $a\in \overline{A}$, we introduce the concept of $a$-smallness for a rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystal on $(R/A)_{\Delta}$. Finally, we focus on some special algebras $R$ over $\mathcal O_{\mathbb C_p}$ (or generally, the ring of integers of an algebraic closed and complete non-archimedean field) including all $p$-completely smooth algebras, $p$-complete algebras with semi-stable reductions and geometric valuation rings. By using our equivalence, we analyze the restriction functor from the category of $a$-small rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystals to the category of $v$-vector bundles. This yields some new results in $p$-adic non-abelian Hodge Theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical analogy between knots and primes motivates the study of Alexander polynomials through an arithmetic perspective. In this article we study the two-parameter family of torus knots and links $T_{p,q}$ and analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the zeros of their Alexander polynomials $\Delta_{p,q}(t)$, defined with respect to the total linking number covering. We prove that as $p,q\to\infty$ these zeros become equidistributed on the unit circle and derive an explicit formula for the limiting frequency with which primitive $r$-th roots of unity appear. To capture finer statistical information, we introduce the moment sequence of the zero distribution and compute its generating function in closed form. We further examine the Iwasawa theory of the corresponding branched covers, determining the Iwasawa invariants. The logarithmic Mahler measure of $\Delta_{p,q}(t)$ vanishes identically and the associated homological growth in towers of abelian covers of $S^3$ branched along $T_{p,q}$ is subexponential.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study two families of zeta-like multiple series -- the multiple $\rho$-values and the multiple $\eta$-values -- defined by nested sums with shifted denominators. An explicit factorial formula for $\rho$ reveals its intrinsic combinatorial structure and leads to closed expressions for fixed weight and depth. A remarkable identity emerges from a weighted-sum transformation, exhibiting a perfect discrete balance. The main theorem proves that the total sums of $\rho$- and $\eta$-values coincide for equal weight but complementary depths. This correspondence provides an analytic basis for integral representations of $\eta$-values and for deriving weighted sum relations. Together, these results show that the $\rho$- and $\eta$-families form two complementary realizations of a unified analytic-combinatorial structure, bridging factorial and harmonic formulations in zeta-like multiple sums.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\Psi(x,y)$ denote the count of $y$-smooth numbers below $x$ and $P(n)$ denote the largest prime factor of $n$. We prove that for $f$ a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, the partial sums over $y$-smooth numbers enjoy better than squareroot cancellation, in the sense that $$ \mathbb E \Big|\sum_{\substack{1\leq n \leq x\\ P(n) \leq y}} f(n) \Big| = o\left( \Psi(x,y)^{1/2} \right),$$ uniformly for $(\log x)^{30} \leq y \leq x$. Our bounds are quantitative and give a large saving when $y$ isn't too close to $x$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The generalized Markov equations are deeply connected with the generalized cluster algebras of Markov type. We construct a deformed Fock-Goncharov tropicalization for the generalized Markov equations and prove that their tropicalized tree structure is essentially the same as that of the classical Euclid tree. We then define the generalized Euclid tree and prove that it converges to the classical Euclid tree up to a scalar multiple. Moreover, by means of cluster mutations, we exhibit an asymptotic phenomenon, up to some limit q, between the logarithmic generalized Markov tree and the classical Euclid tree. A rationality conjecture of q is then put forward. We also propose a generalized Markov uniqueness conjecture for the generalized Markov equations, which illustrates an application of the asymptotic phenomenon.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct some Iwahori types, in the sense of Bushnell-Kutzko, for the double cover of an almost simple simply-laced simply-connected Chevalley group $\widetilde{G}$ over any $2$-adic field. These types capture the covering group analog of the Bernstein block of unramified principal series. We also prove that the associated Hecke algebra essentially admits an Iwahori-Matsumoto (IM) presentation. The complete presentation is obtained for types $A_{r}$, $D_{2r+1}$, $E_{6}$, $E_{7}$; for the other types, some technical obstacles remain. Those Hecke algebras with the complete IM presentation are isomorphic to Iwahori-Hecke algebras of explicit linear Chevalley groups, giving rise to Shimura correspondences. Along the way, we show that the Iwahori type extends to a hyperspecial maximal compact subgroup $\widetilde{K}\subseteq \widetilde{G}$. This extension has minimal depth among the genuine $\widetilde{K}$-representations and allows us to construct a finite Shimura correspondence, generalizing a result of Savin.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent article, Iyama and Marczinzik showed that a lattice is distributive if and only if the incidence algebra is Auslander regular, giving a new connection between homological algebra and lattice theory. In this article we study when a distributive lattice has a pure minimal injective coresolution, a notion first introduced and studied in a work of Ajitabh, Smith and Zhang. We will see that this problem naturally leads to studying when certain antichain modules are perfect modules. We give a classification of perfect antichain modules under the assumption that their canonical antichain resolution is minimal and use this to give a completion classification in lattice theoretic terms of incidence algebras of distributive lattices with pure minimal injective coresolution.</p></details>

Jarossay defined the affine scheme $\mathrm{AdDMR}_0$ determined by the adjoint double shuffle relations and posed a question whether $\mathrm{AdDMR}_0$ is isomorphic to Racinet's double shuffle group $\mathrm{DMR}_0$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In many proofs of Fermat's Two Squares Theorem, the smallest least residue solution $x_0$ of the quadratic congruence $x^2 \equiv -1 \bmod p$ plays an essential role; here $p$ is prime and $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$. Such an $x_0$ is called a St{\o}rmer number, named after the Norwegian mathematician and astronomer Carl St{\o}rmer (1874-1957). In this paper, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for $x_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ to be a St{\o}rmer number of some prime $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$. St{\o}rmer's main interest in his investigations of St{\o}rmer numbers stemmed from his study of identities expressing $\pi$ as finite linear combinations of certain values of the Gregory-MacLaurin series for $\arctan(1/x)$. Since less than 600 digits of $\pi$ were known by 1900, approximating $\pi$ was an important topic. One such identity, discovered by St{\o}rmer in 1896, was used by Yasumasa Kanada and his team in 2002 to obtain 1.24 trillion digits of $\pi$. We also discuss St{\o}rmer's work on connecting these numbers to Gregory numbers and approximations of $\pi$. \u</p></details>

This gives a possibility to construct specific examples of equations not solvable by radicals. A relatively elementary proof without using the full power of Galois theory is due to Weber. We give a rather short proof of Kronecker's theorem with a slightly different argument from Weber's. Several modern presentations of Weber's proof contain inaccuracies, which can be traced back to an error in the original proof. We discuss this error and how it can be corrected.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper studies a basic Markov chain, the Burnside process, on the space of flags $G/B$ with $G = GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $B$ its upper triangular matrices. This gives rise to a shuffling: a Markov chain on the symmetric group realized via the Bruhat decomposition. Actually running and describing this Markov chain requires understanding Springer fibers and the Steinberg variety. The main results give a practical algorithm for all n and q and determine the limiting behavior of the chain when q is large. In describing this behavior, we find interesting connections to the combinatorics of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence and to the geometry of orbital varieties. The construction and description is then carried over to finite Chevalley groups of arbitrary type, describing a new class of Markov chains on Weyl groups.</p></details>

Combining this result with a recent work of Klurman, Lamzouri, and Munsch, shows that the number of these zeros equals $(\log\log |d|) (\log\log \log |d|)^{\theta}$ for almost all $d$, where $|\theta|\leq 1$. This comes close to proving a conjecture of Baker and Montgomery, which predicts $\asymp \log\log |d|$ real zeros of $L'(s, \chi_d)$ in the interval $[1/2, 1]$, for almost all $d$. Moreover, assuming a mild hypothesis on the low lying zeros of quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions (which follows from GRH and the one level density conjecture of Katz and Sarnak), we fully resolve the Baker-Montgomery conjecture (up to the $\log\log\log |d|$ factor). We also show, under the same hypothesis, that for almost all $d$, $100\%$ of the real zeros of $L'(s, \chi_d)$ on $[1/2, 1]$ lie to the right of $1/2+\nu(|d|)/\log |d|$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we discuss an alternative approach to determine an asymptotic equivalent of the partial sum of the reciprocals of prime numbers. This well-known result, related to Merten's second theorem, is usually derived through methods similar to those found in Hardy and Wright's book ``An introduction to the theory of numbers'', involving comparisons with integrals. The present proof differs in several respects, combining an equivalent for the partial sum of $\Lambda(m)/m$, where $\Lambda$ denotes the von Mangoldt function, with an application of Abel's summation formula and properties of the second Chebyshev function $\Psi(x)=\sum_{n\le x}\Lambda(n)$. A simple application to the study of integers with large prime factors is also presented. Beyond the pedagogical aspect of this work, the aim is to highlight the complementarity of arithmetic functions and to show that interesting (and nontrivial) results can be obtained by means of elementary methods.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a general method to study representations of quivers over abstract stable homotopy theories (e.g. arbitrary rings, schemes, dg algebras, or ring spectra) in terms of Auslander-Reiten diagrams. For a finite acyclic quiver $Q$ and a stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, we prove an abstract equivalence of the representations $\mathcal{C}^Q$ with a certain mesh $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{Z}Q,\, \mathrm{mesh}}$ of representations of the repetitive quiver $\mathbb{Z}Q$, that we build inductively using abstract reflection functors. This allows to produce, from the symmetries of the Auslander-Reiten quiver, universal autoequivalences of representations $\mathcal{C}^Q$ in any stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, which are the elements of the spectral Picard group of $Q$. In particular, we get abstract versions of key functors in classical representation theory -- e.g. reflection functors, the Auslander-Reiten translation, the Serre functor, etc. Moreover, for representations of trees this enables us to realize the whole derived Picard group over a field as a factor of the spectral Picard group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that an arithmetic path integral over the $\ell$-torsion of a Jacobian $J[\ell]$ is equal to the trace of the Frobenius action on a representation of the Heisenberg group $H(J[\ell])$, up to an explicitly determined sign. This is an arithmetic analogue of trace--path integral formulae which arise in quantum field theory, where path integrals over a space of sections of a fibration over a circle can be expressed as the trace of the monodromy action on a Hilbert space.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the full Fock--Goncharov conjecture for $\mathcal{A}_{SL_2,\Sigma_{g,p}}$, the $\mathcal{A}$-cluster variety of the moduli of decorated twisted $SL_2$-local systems on triangulable surfaces $\Sigma_{g,p}$ with at least 2 punctures. Equivalently, we show that the tagged skein algebra $Sk^{ta}(\Sigma)$, or the middle cluster algebra $\mathrm{mid}(\mathcal{A})$, coincides with the upper cluster algebra $U(\Sigma)$. Inspired by the work of Shen--Sun--Weng, we introduce the localized cluster variety $\mathring{\mathcal{A}}$ as the algebraic version of the decorated Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}^d(\Sigma)$. We show its global section $\Gamma(\mathring{\mathcal{A}},\mathcal{O}_{\mathring{\mathcal{A}}})$ equals the classical Roger-Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_{q\to1}(\Sigma)$, providing a quantization of $\mathcal{T}^d(\Sigma)$ in terms of the Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_q(\Sigma)$. As a consequence of our geometric characterizations, we deduce normality and the Gorenstein property of the tagged skein algebra $Sk^{ta}(\Sigma)$ and the classical Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_{q\to1}(\Sigma)$, as well as finite generation of upper cluster algebra $U(\Sigma)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the existence and give a classification of all $d$-tilting bundles (and thus geometric Helices) consisting of line bundles on $d$-dimensional smooth toric Fano DM stacks of Picard number one or two. Here, a $d$-tilting bundle is a tilting bundle whose endomorphism algebra has global dimension $d$ or less. In the case of Picard number one, tilting bundles consisting of line bundles correspond bijectively to non-trivial upper sets in its Picard group equipped with a certain partial order. Moreover, all of them are $d$-tilting bundles and their endomorphisms algebras become $d$-representation infinite algebras of type $\tilde{A}$. Conversely, all such algebras arise in this way. In this sense, we can think of smooth toric Fano DM stacks with Picard number one as geometric models of higher representation infinite algebras of type $\tilde{A}$. Using this geometric model, we give a new combinatorial description to $d$-APR tilting modules of them. In the case of Picard number two, $d$-tilting bundles consisting of line bundles correspond bijectively to pairs $(I,I')$, where $I$ and $I'$ are non-trivial upper sets in certain partially ordered sets. Here, $I$ corresponds to a non-commutative crepant resolution (NCCR) of a certain Gorenstein toric singularity with divisor class group of rank one and $I'$ corresponds to a cut of the quiver of this NCCR. Moreover, the endomorphism algebras of these $d$-tilting bundles also become $d$-representation infinite algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $L/K$ be a cyclic extension of number fields, and let $S$ be a finite set of places of $K$ containing the ramified and Archimedean ones. We say that $L/K$ has the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property if, for any generator $\sigma \in \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$, the kernel of the arithmetic norm map $\mathbf{cl}^S(L) \to \mathbf{cl}^S(K)$ coincides with $(1 - \sigma)\mathbf{cl}^S(L)$. In this article, we first provide a method to verify the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property, which does not require any knowledge of the class group of $L$. Then we investigate a connection between the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property and the Gross-Kuz'min conjecture from Iwasawa theory. In doing so, we derive a new criterion for the Gross-Kuz'min conjecture, related to Fermat quotients and spin symbols of prime ideals, which can easily be checked by explicit computation. We conjecture that, in the totally real case, the condition holds for all but finitely many primes. Finally, we present numerical evidence supporting a heuristic in favor of this conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1878, Sylvester proved Cayley's Conjecture that the coefficients of the Gaussian $q$-binomial coefficients are unimodal. In 1990, O'Hara famously discovered a constructive combinatorial proof, and in 2013, Pak and Panova proved the stronger property of strict unimodality for sufficiently large parameters. We move from unimodality to log-concavity and higher degree $ d$ log-concavity, known as Tur\'an inequalities. Although $q$-binomial coefficients are not always log- or degree $d$ log-concave, it's natural to ask to what extent these inequalities hold. In infinite families with limiting aspect ratio bounded away from zero and one, we prove that these stronger inequalities hold uniformly, for each $C>0,$ on the central window $|m-\mu|< C\sigma,$ where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation of the normalized distribution. More generally, we obtain the same conclusions for $q$-multinomial coefficients. These results stem from the asymptotic behavior of normalized Jensen polynomials, which are approximated by Hermite polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a curve of genus at least four which is either very general or very general hyperelliptic, we classify all ways in which a power of its Jacobian can be isogenous to a product of Jacobians of curves. As an application, we show that, for a very general principally polarized abelian variety of dimension at least four, or the intermediate Jacobian of a very general cubic threefold, no power is isogenous to a product of Jacobians of curves. This confirms some cases of the Coleman-Oort conjecture. We further deduce from our results some progress on the question whether the integral Hodge conjecture fails for such abelian varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The orbital bivariate chromatic polynomial, introduced in this article, counts the number of ways to color the vertices of a graph with $\lambda$ colors such that adjacent vertices either receive distinct colors from a set of $\lambda$ colors, or the same color from a distinguished subset of $\lambda-\mu$ colors, up to a group of symmetries. This new graph polynomial simultaneously generalizes the orbital chromatic polynomial due to Cameron and Kayibi (2007) and the bivariate chromatic polynomial due to Dohmen, P\"onitz, and Tittmann (2003). We discuss fundamental properties, and provide expansions of this new polynomial for various families of graphs, including complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, paths, and cycles. Some of these expansions are even new for the orbital chromatic polynomial. In addition to these results, we rediscover Fermat's Little Theorem and a ``Fermat-like'' congruence for Lucas numbers. Finally, we outline several open problems related to the orbital bivariate chromatic polynomial.</p></details>

Given a countable subset $Q \subset X$, a positive function $R: Q \to \mathbb{R}^+:\xi \mapsto R_{\xi}$, and a non-decreasing function $\phi$, we consider the set $E(Q, R, \phi)$ of points $x \in X$ for which there are infinitely many $\xi \in Q$ satisfying $$d(x, \xi) < \phi(R_{\xi}),$$ yet for any $0<\epsilon<1$, there are only finitely many $\xi \in Q$ such that $$d(x, \xi) < (1-\epsilon)\phi(R_{\xi}).$$ We provide sufficient conditions (which are also necessary under some mild assumptions) for the $s$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of $E(Q, R, \phi)$ to be infinite. This framework generalizes not only the classical set $\mathrm{Exact}(\psi)$ of points exactly $\psi$-approximable by rationals (where $\psi$ is non-increasing), but also certain restricted Diophantine approximation sets.</p></details>

We describe a quiver presentation for the monoid algebra $\Bbbk\mathrm{OD}_{n}$ where $\Bbbk$ is a field whose characteristic is not 2. We show that the quiver consists of two straightline paths, one with $n-1$ vertices and one with $n$ vertices, and that all compositions of consecutive arrows are equal to $0$. As part of the proof we obtain a complete description of all homomorphisms between induced left Sch\"utzenberger modules of $\Bbbk\mathrm{OD}_{n}$. We also define $\mathrm{COD}_{n}$ to be a covering of $\mathrm{OD}_{n}$ with an artificial distinction between order-preserving and order-reversing constant functions. We show that $\mathrm{COD}_{n}\simeq\mathrm{O}_{n}\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ where $\mathrm{O}_{n}$ is the monoid of all order-preserving functions on the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. Moreover, if $\Bbbk$ is a field whose characteristic is not $2$ we prove that $\Bbbk\mathrm{COD}_{n}\simeq\Bbbk\mathrm{O}_{n}\times\Bbbk\mathrm{O}_{n}$. As a corollary, we deduce that the quiver of $\Bbbk\mathrm{COD}_{n}$ consists of two straightline paths with n vertices, and that all compositions of consecutive arrows are equal to $0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the quantum affine general linear superalgebra $\mathrm{U}_q\big(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{m|n,\mathbf{s}}\big)$ for arbitrary 01-sequences $\mathbf{s}$, using the RTT presentation. We systematically construct the RTT presentation for quantum general linear superalgebra $\mathrm{U}_q\big(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n,\mathbf{s}}\big)$, and derive a PBW basis induced by the action of the braid group, compatible with non-standard parities. We determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for the finite-dimensionality of irreducible representations of $\mathrm{U}_q\big(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n,\mathbf{s}}\big)$ and extend the results to the affine case via the evaluation homomorphism. Specific cases such as $(m,n)=(1,1)$ demonstrate that all finite-dimensional representations are tensor products of typical evaluation representations. This work extends existing representation frameworks and classification methods to encompass arbitrary 01-sequences, establishing the foundation for subsequent research on representations of quantum affine superalgebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this short note, we work in the general framework of supersingular abelian varieties defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. Using Coleman maps constructed by B\"uy\"ukboduk--Lei, we define some objects called ``the multi-signed Mordell-Weil groups" for supersingular abelian varieties, make comments on the structure of the dual of these groups as an Iwasawa module and show a (weak) control theorem. This recovers the case of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ non-ordinary at the prime $p$ with $a_p=0$ studied by Antonio Lei. Using the multi-signed Mordell-Weil groups we define what we call ``the multi-signed Tate-Shafarevich groups" along the cyclotomic tower of $\mathbb{Q}$. Finally we pose some open questions related to our newly defined objects and make a remark on the asymptotic growth of these multi-signed Tate-Shafarevich groups along the cyclotomic tower using an idea of Meng Fai Lim.</p></details>

As an application, we use this to guess the structure of quotients of symmetric power representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{q})$ by submodules in the theta filtration. We then give a direct proof of this structure showing that such quotients are built out of principal series representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article concerns the computational complexity of a fundamental problem in number theory: counting points on curves and surfaces over finite fields. There is no subexponential-time algorithm known and it is unclear if it can be $\mathrm{NP}$-hard. Given a curve, we present the first efficient Arthur-Merlin protocol to certify its point-count, its Jacobian group structure, and its Hasse-Weil zeta function. We extend this result to a smooth projective surface to certify the factor $P_{1}(T)$, corresponding to the first Betti number, of the zeta function; by using the counting oracle. We give the first algorithm to compute $P_{1}(T)$ that is poly($\log q$)-time if the degree $D$ of the input surface is fixed; and in quantum poly($D\log q$)-time in general. Our technique in the curve case, is to sample hash functions using the Weil and Riemann-Roch bounds, to certify the group order of its Jacobian. For higher dimension varieties, we first reduce to the case of a surface, which is fibred as a Lefschetz pencil of hyperplane sections over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. The formalism of vanishing cycles, and the inherent big monodromy, enable us to prove an effective version of Deligne's `theoreme du pgcd' using the hard-Lefschetz theorem and an equidistribution result due to Katz. These reduce our investigations to that of computing the zeta function of a curve, defined over a finite field extension $\mathbb{F}_{Q}/\mathbb{F}_{q}$ of poly-bounded degree. This explicitization of the theory yields the first nontrivial upper bounds on the computational complexity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\Gamma \subset \bar{\Q}^{\times}$ be a finitely generated multiplicative group of algebraic numbers, let $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_m$ be non-zero algebraic numbers, and let $\varepsilon >0$ be fixed. In this paper, we prove that there exist only finitely many tuples $(u_1, \ldots, u_m, q, p)\in \Gamma^m\times\mathbb{Z}^2$ with $d = [\mathbb{Q}(u_1, \ldots, u_m):\mathbb{Q}]$ such that for any two tuples $(u_1,\ldots,u_m)$ and $(u'_1,\ldots,u'_m)$, we have $\frac{u_{i_1}}{u_{i_2}}\neq \frac{u'_{i_1}}{u'_{i_2}}$ for $1\leq i_1\neq i_2\leq m$ and it is stable under Galois conjugation over $\Q$, $\max\{|\alpha_1 qu_1|, \ldots, |\alpha_m qu_m|\}>1$, $H\left(\frac{u_{i_1}}{\sigma(u_{i_2})}\right)>\displaystyle\max_{\substack{1\leq i_1 \neq i_2\leq m}}\Bigl\{H\left(\frac{\sigma(\alpha_{i_2})}{\alpha_{i_1}}\right)\mid \sigma:\mathbb{Q}(u_1,\ldots, u_m)\rightarrow \mathbb{C}\Bigl\}$, the tuple $(\alpha_1qu_1, \ldots, \alpha_mq u_m)$ is not pseudo-Pisot and $$0< \left|\sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_iq u_i - p\right|<\frac{1}{\left(\prod_{i=1}^mH( u_i)\right)^{\varepsilon} |q|^{md+\varepsilon}},$$ where $H(u_i)$ denotes the absolute Weil height. This result extends one of the main results of Corvaja-Zannier \cite{corv}. In addition, we prove a result similar to \cite[Theorem 1.4]{kul} in a more general setting. In our proofs, we exploit the subspace theorem based on the work of Corvaja-Zannier.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study birational quasi-isomorphisms between normal Noetherian domains endowed with cluster structures of geometric type. We prove an analogue of the Starfish lemma that allows one to transfer various cluster and algebraic properties of one variety onto another. In particular, we develop tools for proving that an upper cluster algebra equals the given commutative ring.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is the first of two papers on quasi-split affine quantum symmetric pairs $\big(\widetilde{\mathbf U}(\widehat{\mathfrak g}), \widetilde{{\mathbf U}}^\imath \big)$, focusing on the real rank one case, i.e., $\mathfrak{g}= \mathfrak{sl}_3$ equipped with a diagram involution. We construct explicitly a relative braid group action of type $A_2^{(2)}$ on the affine $\imath$quantum group $\widetilde{{\mathbf U}}^\imath$. Real and imaginary root vectors for $\widetilde{{\mathbf U}}^\imath$ are constructed, and a Drinfeld type presentation of $\widetilde{{\mathbf U}}^\imath$ is then established. This provides a new basic ingredient for the Drinfeld type presentation of higher rank quasi-split affine $\imath$quantum groups in the sequel.</p></details>
