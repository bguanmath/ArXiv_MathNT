 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nico Cooper &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** hep-th &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Hecke operators acting on modular functions arise naturally in the context of 2d conformal field theory, but in seemingly disparate areas, including permutation orbifold theories, ensembles of code CFTs, and more recently in the context of the AdS$_3$/RMT$_2$ program. We use an equidistribution theorem for Hecke operators to show that in each of these large $N$ limits, an entire heavy sector of the partition function gets integrated out, leaving only contributions from Poincaré series of light states. This gives an immediate holographic interpretation as a sum over semiclassical handlebody geometries. We speculate on further physical interpretations for equidistribution, including a potential ergodicity statement.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 26 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a general class $F_0$ of additive functions $f$ such that $f(p) = 1$ and prove a tight bound for exponential sums of the form $\sum_{n \le x} f(n) e(αn)$ where $f \in F_0$ and $e(θ) = \exp(2πi θ)$. Both $ω$, the number of distinct primes of $n$, and $Ω$, the total number primes of $n$, are members of $F_0$. As an application of the exponential sum result, we use the Hardy-Littlewood circle method to find the asymptotics of the Goldbach-Vinogradov ternary problem associated to $Ω$, namely we show the behavior of $r_Ω(N) = \sum_{n_1+n_2+n_3=N}Ω(n_1)Ω(n_2)Ω(n_3)$, as $N \to \infty$. Lastly, we end with a discussion of further applications of the main result.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove and generalize some recent conjectures of Z.-W. Sun on infinite series whose summands involve products of harmonic numbers and several binomial coefficients. We evaluate various classes of infinite sums in closed form by interpreting them as automorphic objects on the moduli spaces for Legendre curves $Y^{ g+1}=(1-X)^{ g}X(1-t X)$ of positive genera $ g\in\{1,2,3,5\}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use explicit class field theory of rational function fields to prove a dynamical criterion for a polynomial of the form $x^{p^r}+ax+b$ over a field of characteristic $p$ to have dynamical Galois group as large as possible. When $p=2$ and $r=1$ this yields an analogue in characteristic $2$ of the celebrated criterion of Stoll for quadratic polynomials over fields of characteristic not $2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime number, $F$ a field of characteristic $p$, and $G$ a cyclic group of order $q =p^a$ for some positive integer $a$. Under these circumstances every indecomposable $F G$-module is cyclic. For indecomposable $F G$-modules $U$ and $W$, we present a new recursive method for identifying a generator for each of the indecomposable components of $U \otimes W$ in terms of a particular $F$-basis of $U \otimes W$.</p></details>

We also prove an analogous result for the corresponding finite fusion tensor categories.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zhi-Wei Sun, Yajun Zhou &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages, 1 table

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We derive modular parametrizations for certain infinite series whose summands involve central binomial coefficients and second-order harmonic numbers. When the rates of convergence are certain rational numbers, modularity allows us to reduce the corresponding series to special values of the Dirichlet $L$-values. For example, we establish the following identity that has been recently conjectured by Sun:$$\sum_{k=0}^\infty\binom{2k}{k}^3\left[ \mathsf H_{2k}^{(2)}-\frac{25}{92}\mathsf H_{ k}^{(2)} +\frac{735L_{-7}(2)-86π^{2}}{1104}\right]\frac{1}{4096^{k}}=0,$$ where $ \mathsf H^{(2)}_k:= \sum_{0<j\leq k}\frac{1}{j^2}$ and $ L_{-7}(2):= \sum_{n=1}^\infty\left(\frac{-7}{n}\right)\frac{1}{n^2}=\frac{1}{1^2}+\frac{1}{2^2}-\frac{1}{3^2}+\frac{1}{4^{2}}-\frac{1}{5^{2}}-\frac{1}{6^{2}}+\frac{1}{8^{2}}+\cdots $.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Alessandro Arlandini, David Loeffler &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Based on the first author's 2020 Warwick PhD thesis. Revised version, 40 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a cusp form $f$ which is supersingular at a fixed prime $p$ away from the level, and a Coleman family $F$ through one of its $p$-stabilisations, we construct a $2$-variable meromorphic $p$-adic $L$-function for the symmetric square of $F$. We prove that this new $p$-adic $L$-function interpolates values of complex imprimitive symmetric square $L$-functions, for the various specialisations of the family $F$. We use this $p$-adic $L$-function to prove a $p$-adic factorisation formula, expressing the geometric $p$-adic $L$-function attached to the Rankin--Selberg convolution of $f$ with itself as a the product of the $p$-adic symmetric square $L$-function of $f$ and a Kubota-Leopoldt $L$-function. This extends a result of Dasgupta in the ordinary case.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** William Craig, Madeline Locus Dawsey, Guo-Niu Han &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Updated to reflect referee comments, accepted in JCTA

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we consider the asymptotic properties of hook numbers of partitions in restricted classes. More specifically, we compare the frequency with which partitions into odd parts and partitions into distinct parts have hook numbers equal to $h \geq 1$ by deriving an asymptotic formula for the total number of hooks equal to $h$ that appear among partitions into odd and distinct parts, respectively. We use these asymptotic formulas to prove a recent conjecture of the first author and collaborators that for $h \geq 2$ and $n \gg 0$, partitions into odd parts have, on average, more hooks equal to $h$ than do partitions into distinct parts. We also use our asymptotics to prove certain probabilistic statements about how hooks distribute in the rows of partitions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jeremy Booher, Steven R. Groen, Joe Kramer-Miller &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 40 pages, comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article we study the Ekedahl-Oort types of $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-Galois covers $π:Y \to X$ in characteristic two. When the base curve $X$ is ordinary, we show that the Ekedahl-Oort type of $Y$ is completely determined by the genus of $X$ and the ramification of $π$. For a general base curve $X$, we prove bounds on the Ekedahl-Oort depending on the Ekedahl-Oort type of $X$ and the ramification of $π$. Along the way, we develop a theory of \emph{enhanced differentials of the second kind}. This theory allows us to study algebraic de Rham cohomology in any characteristic by working directly with differentials, in contrast to the standard Čech resolution.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Owen Garnier &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** New version following referee report. 11 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The purpose of this note is to prove a conjecture of Shvartsman relating a complex projective reflection group with the quotient of a suitable complex braid group by its center. Shvartsman originally proved this result in the case of real projective reflection groups, and we extend it to all complex projective reflection groups. Our study also allows us to correct a result of Broué, Malle, Rouquier on projective reflection groups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** New version following referee report. 56 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In his proof of the K(pi,1) conjecture for complex reflection arrangements, Bessis defined Garside categories suitable for studying braid groups of centralizers of Springer regular elements in well-generated complex reflection groups. We provide a detailed study of these categories, which we call Springer categories. We describe in particular the conjugacy of braided reflections of regular centralizer in terms of the Garside structure of the associated Springer category. In so doing we obtain a pure Garside theoretic proof of a theorem of Digne, Marin and Michel on the center of finite index subgroups in complex braid groups in the case of a regular centralizer in a well-generated group. We also provide a "Hurwitz-like" presentation of Springer categories. To this aim we provide additional insights on noncrossing partitions in the infinite series. Lastly, we use this "Hurwitz-like" presentation, along with a generalized Reidemeister-Schreier method we introduce for groupoids, to deduce nice presentations of the complex braid group B(G31).</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16020v2'>2311.16020</a>\]&nbsp; **The Dehn Twist Action for Quantum Representations of Mapping Class Groups**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Lukas Müller, Lukas Woike &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 20 pages, 2 figures, update to final version containing minor improvements

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We calculate the Dehn twist action on the spaces of conformal blocks of a not necessarily semisimple modular category. In particular, we give the order of the Dehn twists under the mapping class group representations of closed surfaces. For Dehn twists about non-separating simple closed curves, we prove that this order is the order of the ribbon twist, thereby generalizing a result that De Renzi-Gainutdinov-Geer-Patureau-Mirand-Runkel obtained for the small quantum group. In the separating case, we express the order using the order of the ribbon twist on monoidal powers of the canonical end. As an application, we prove that the Johnson kernels of the mapping class groups act trivially if and only if for the canonical end the ribbon twist and double braiding with itself are trivial. We give a similar result for the visibility of the Torelli groups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 41 pages. We extended the introduction, discussed the CM case in more detail, and added more numerical examples

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We discuss several congruences satisfied by the coefficients of meromorphic modular forms, or equivalently, the $p$-adic behaviors of meromorphic modular forms under the $U_p$ operator, that are summarized from numerical experiments. In the generic case, we observe the connection to symmetric powers of elliptic curves, while in the CM case, we furthermore observe the connection to the $p$-adic analogue of the Chowla--Selberg periods. Along with the discussions, we will provide some heuristic explanations for these congruences as well as prove some of them using hypergeometric functions and the Borcherds--Shimura lift.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tatsuya Ohnishi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 56 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a smooth algebraic curve defined over a number field, one can associate a bipartite graph known as a dessin d'enfant. In this paper, we investigate the regularity and automorphism groups of dessins d'enfants with uniform passports, that is, those for which the valencies of black vertices, white vertices, and faces are constant, and study how these properties depend on the genus. Although uniformity imposes a high degree of symmetry, such dessins are not necessarily regular. Our main results are as follows: (1) A passport of the form $[a^{p}, b^{q}, n]$ (the tree case) admits a regular dessin if and only if $\gcd(p,q)=1$. (2) Every passport of the form $[n, b^{q}, n]$ of genus at least 2 admits a dessin with a trivial automorphism group. In addition, we obtain several results on uniform passports of genus 0 and 1. We also establish two theorems on the enumeration of elements in symmetric groups, which are useful for the study of automorphism groups of dessins.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 119 pages; we improve the exposition following the referee's suggestions

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Under a stronger genericity condition, we prove the local analogue of ghost conjecture of Bergdall and Pollack. As applications, we deduce in this case (a) a folklore conjecture of Breuil--Buzzard--Emerton on the crystalline slopes of Kisin's crystabelian deformation spaces, (b) Gouvea's $\lfloor\frac{k-1}{p+1}\rfloor$-conjecture on slopes of modular forms, and (c) the finiteness of irreducible components of the eigencurve. In addition, applying combinatorial arguments by Bergdall and Pollack, and by Ren, we deduce as corollaries in the reducible and strongly generic case, (d) Gouvea--Mazur conjecture, (e) a variant of Gouvea's conjecture on slope distributions, and (f) a refined version of Coleman's spectral halo conjecture.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Correction of minor typos and issue with cleveref package

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this series of papers, we investigate properties of a finite group which are determined by its low degree irreducible representations over a number field $F$, i.e. its representations on matrix rings $\mathrm{M}_n(D)$ with $n \leq 2$. In particular we focus on representations on $\mathrm{M}_2(D)$ where $D$ is a division algebra having an order $\mathcal{O}$ such that $\mathcal{O}$ has finitely many units, i.e. such that $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathcal{O})$ has arithmetic rank $1$. In this first part, the focus is on two aspects. One aspect concerns characterisations of such representing spaces in terms of Serre's homological goodness property, small virtual cohomological dimension and higher Kleinian-type embeddings. As an application, we obtain several characterisations of the finite groups $G$ whose irreducible representations are of the mentioned form. In particular, such groups $G$ are precisely those such that $\mathcal{U}(R G)$, with $R$ the ring of integers of $F$, can be constructed from groups which virtually map onto a non-abelian free group. Along the way we investigate the latter property for congruence subgroups of higher modular groups and its implications for the congruence kernel. This is used to obtain new information on the congruence kernel of the unit group of a group ring. The second aspect concerns the conjugacy classes of the images of finite subgroups of $\mathcal{U}(R G)$ under the irreducible representations of $G$. More precisely, we initiate the study of a blockwise variant of the Zassenhaus conjectures and the subgroup isomorphism problem. Moreover, we contribute to them for the low rank representations above.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the space of Belyi maps admits a natural parametrization by an infinite-dimensional sphere arising from Voiculescu's theory of noncommutative probability spaces. We show that this sphere decomposes into sectors, each of which corresponds to a class of Belyi maps distinguished up to isomorphism by their monodromy, encoded by a finite-index subgroup of F2. For Galois Belyi maps, our correspondence between spectral sectors of the infinite sphere and algebraic quotients of F2 yields a genuine bijection. Within this framework, distinct sectors of the sphere capture the algebraic constraints imposed on the monodromy, thereby providing a geometric organization of Belyi maps according to their associated group-theoretic data.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p>3$ be a prime number, $f\geq1$ an integer. We consider a certain full subcategory $\mathcal C$ of the category of smooth admissible mod $p$ representations of either $\text{GL}_2\mathbf Q_{p^f}$ or of the group of units of the quaternion algebra over $\mathbf Q_{p^f}$. This category was introduced in the context of the mod $p$ Langlands program by Breuil-Herzig-Hu-Morra-Schraen in the $\text{GL}_2$-case and by Hu-Wang in the quaternion case. We prove that whether a smooth admissible mod $p$ representation $π$ (with central character) belongs to $\mathcal C$ is completely determined by the restriction of $π$ to an arbitrarily small open subgroup.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An ideal setting to exhibit infinite sets of primes $p$ relative to which an integer is a primitive root $\pmod p$ is provided by the Bézout subdomain $\widetilde{\mathbb{B}}:=\mathbb{Z}^{\mathbb{P}}/\mathfrak{U}$ of the valuation domain $\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}=\prod_{\mathfrak{U}} \mathbb{Z}_p$ with respect to a nonprincipal ultrafilter $\mathfrak{U}$ on $\mathbb{P}$, extant via Chebotarev's theorem and the ultrafilter theorem and such that the relative algebraic closure $\mathbb{L}:=\mathrm{Abs}(\widetilde{\mathbb{Q}})$ of the prime field of the valued field $\widetilde{\mathbb{Q}}=\prod_{\mathfrak{U}} \mathbb{Q}_p$ contains $\sqrt{-\tilde p}$ for $p\in\mathbb{P}$, contains no $\sqrt[3]{\tilde q}$ for $q\in\mathbb{P}$, and has $\mathrm{tor}(\mathbb{L}^\times)=\langle ζ_6\rangle$. Results include positive resolutions of the conjectured infinitude of primes $p$ for which (i) $\frac{p-1}{6}$ is prime and (ii) a non-perfect-square $-1\neq m\in\mathbb{Z}$ is a primitive root $\pmod p$, establishing as manifest the efficacy of ultraproduct treatments in resolving number theory problems requiring certification of countably infinite conforming sets. Furthermore, we extend these results to the quantitative regime by identifying the primitive-root indicator as a projection in the $C^\ast$-algebra $\ell^\infty(\mathbb{P})$. We prove that the Bézout rigidity of $\widetilde{\mathbb{B}}$ and the $\mathbf{\tildeν}$-anchor enforce the normality of the density state, thereby algebraically precluding ``spectral leakage'' into the infinite tail of Kummer obstructions. This provides a structural, GRH-free proof that the natural density exists as the vacuum expectation value in a GNS representation: $δ_m=ω_δ(f_m)= c_m\prod_{q\in\mathbb{P}}(1-\frac{1}{q(q-1)})$ where $\prod_{q\in\mathbb{P}}(1-\frac{1}{q(q-1)})$ is the Artin Euler product.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove functional equations for multiple Dirichlet series defined by a collection of five geometric axioms. We find functional equations of two types: one modeled on the functional equations of Dirichlet $L$-functions, and another modeled on the functional equations of Kubota $L$-series with Gauss sums as coefficients. These functional equations generate groupoid structures, which we relate to the Weyl groupoids of arithmetic root systems. From the known classification of arithmetic root systems, we obtain a complete classification of multiple Dirichlet series which can be used to compute moments of $L$-functions via established analytic techniques. Our classification includes all moments of $L$-functions which have appeared in the multiple Dirichlet series literature previously, alongside some new moments. Finally, we give applications of our functional equations to quantum algebra, specifically the cohomology of Nichols algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Drinfeld's degenerate affine analog of Schur-Weyl duality relates representations of the degenerate affine Hecke algebra $AH_r$ to representations of the Yangian $Y_n$. One way to understand the construction is to introduce an intermediate algebra $AS(n,r)$, the degenerate affine Schur algebra, which appears both as the endomorphism algebra of an induced tensor space over $AH_r$, and as the image of a homomorphism $D_{n,r}:Y_n \rightarrow AS(n,r)$. In this paper, we describe $D_{n,r}$ using a diagrammatic calculus. Then we use a theorem of Drinfeld to compute $\ker D_{n,r}$ when $n > r$, thereby giving a presentation of $AS(n,r)$ in these cases. We formulate a conjecture in the remaining cases. Finally, we apply results of Arakawa to develop some of the representation theory of $AS(n,r)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a prime $p\equiv 1 \,(\bmod{4})$, let $$ \varepsilon = \frac{1}{2}\left( t + u\sqrt{p}\right) $$ be the fundamental unit of the real quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p})$. In 1951, N. Ankeny, E. Artin, and S. Chowla asked whether $p$ can divide $u$. They suggested that this can never happen and this has since been called the Ankeny--Artin--Chowla (AAC) conjecture. We show that if $\mathfrak{p}$ is the prime above $p$ in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p})$, then the AAC conjecture is false if and only if $$ \varepsilon^{p-1} \equiv 1\, (\bmod{\mathfrak{p}^2}). $$ Thus, the AAC conjecture is related to the existence of number field analogues of Wieferich primes. Therefore, in the second part of this paper, we investigate the infinitude of Wieferich primes in number fields. Subject to Masser's $abc$-conjecture for number fields, we prove that for any fixed $α\in \mathcal{O}_K\setminus\{0\}$ that is not a root of unity, there are infinitely many primes ideals $\mathfrak{p}\subseteq \mathcal{O}_K$ for which $$ α^{N(\mathfrak{p})-1} \not\equiv 1\, (\bmod{\mathfrak{p}^2}). $$ Additionally, we show under the weaker assumption that there are finitely many base-$α$ super-Wieferich primes, and that there are infinitely many base-$α$ non-Wieferich primes. In both cases, we obtain the lower bound $$ \#\left\{\text{prime ideals } \mathfrak{p} : N(\mathfrak{p})\leq x \text{ and } α^{N(\mathfrak{p})-1}\not\equiv 1 \,(\bmod{\mathfrak{p}^2})\right\} \gg_{K, α, \varepsilon} \frac{\log x}{\log\log x} $$ as $x\to \infty$.</p></details>

Supported by computational and theoretical evidence, we also conjecture that this is true for all primes $p$. These results allow us to classify all points of degree $\leq 25$ on $X_0(p)$ that come from a map to some curve of genus $\geq 2$. As an application, we were able to determine all curves $X_0(p)$ with infinitely many points of degree $6$ over $\mathbb Q$ except for $p=193$, continuing the previous results on small degree points on $X_0(N)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We examine the cell modules for the category of type An webs and their natural cellular forms. We modify the bases of these modules, as described by Elias, to obtain an orthogonal basis of each cell module. Hence, we calculate the determinant of the Gram matrix with respect to such bases. These Gram determinants are given in terms of intersection forms, computed from certain traces of clasps - higher order Jones-Wenzl morphisms. Additionally, the modified basis is constructed using these clasps, and each clasp is constructed using traces of smaller clasps. Elias conjectures a value for these intersection forms and verifies it in types $A_1$, $A_2$ and $A_3$. This paper concludes with a proof of the conjecture in type $A_n$.</p></details>

Then we introduce the notion of admissible classical Yang-Baxter equations in averaging pre-Lie algebras, as well as the relative Rota-Baxter operators on averaging pre-Lie algebras, and show that the relative Rota-Baxter operators on averaging pre-Lie algebras yield symmetric solutions of admissible classical Yang-Baxter equations in averaging pre-Lie algebras.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Many modern learning tasks require models that can take inputs of varying sizes. Consequently, dimension-independent architectures have been proposed for domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design principles for designing new transferable models. Numerical experiments support our findings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\varphi$ be the Hörmander--Bernhardsson extremal function, and let $(\pmτ_n)_{n\ge1}$ be its real zeros. Using the recent analytic description of the zero set ${τ_n}$, we prove that the squared zeros $λ_n=τ_n^{2}$ form an admissible sequence in the sense of Quine--Heydari--Song: the heat trace $Θ(t)=\sum_{n\ge1}e^{-λ_n t}$ has a full $t\to0^{+}$ expansion in pure powers of $t^{1/2}$. The proof is based on an analytic normal form $$ λ_n=\Bigl(n+\tfrac12\Bigr)^2+q!\Bigl(\Bigl(n+\tfrac12\Bigr)^{-2}\Bigr), $$ a uniform Taylor expansion in $t$, and a Mellin--Hurwitz zeta analysis of the resulting weighted Gaussian sums. As applications we obtain meromorphic continuation and special-value information for the associated spectral zeta function and zeta-regularized product, sharp large-parameter asymptotics for the canonical product $\prod_{n}(1+z/λ_n)$. In particular, we deduce the conjecture by Bondarenko--Ortega-Cerdà--Radchenko--Seip for the special values of the Dirichlet-type series attached to $\varphi$. We also establish a parity dichotomy: sequences $(τ_n^m)$ are QHS--admissible for even $m$, while for odd $m$ a nonzero $t\log t$ term obstructs admissibility.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Alpöge--Bhargava--Shnidman showed that even a strengthened \emph{no local obstruction} condition for monogenicity does not force a global power integral basis: in the full spaces of cubic and quartic fields, a positive proportion are non-monogenic yet satisfy this ABS fixed-sign condition. This raises a natural family-level question: does the same phenomenon persist inside one-parameter families, where the local structure varies in a highly constrained way? In this paper we answer this in the negative for the pure fields $K_m=\mathbb Q(α)$ with $α^n=m$ ($n\ge 4$) and $m$ square-free. Writing $g(m)=[\mathcal O_{K_m}:\mathbb Z[α]]$, we prove that the set of square-free $m$ for which $g(m)>1$ but $K_m$ has no ABS local obstruction has natural density $0$. Consequently, in the pure family monogenicity and $α$--monogenicity have the same natural density. The proof isolates a reusable mechanism, which we call the Eisenstein-prime obstruction sieve. The argument is packaged in an abstract template and transfers to other Eisenstein parameter families.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be prime, and let $p_{[1,p]}(n)$ denote the function whose generating function is $\prod (1-q^n)^{-1}(1 - q^{pn})^{-1}$. This function and its generalizations $p_{[c^{\ell}, d^m]}(n)$ are the subject of study in several recent papers. Let $\ell\geq 5$, let $j\geq 1$, and let $p \in \{2, 3, 5\}$. In this paper, we prove that the generating function for $p_{[1, p]}(n)$ in the progression $β_{p, \ell, j}$ modulo $\ell^j$ with $24β_{p, \ell, j} \equiv p + 1 \pmod{\ell^j}$ lies in a Hecke-invariant subspace of type $\{η(Dz)η(Dpz)F(Dz) : F(z) \in M_{s}(Γ_0(p), χ)\}$ for suitable $D\geq 1$, $s\geq 0$, and character~$χ$. When $p\in \{2, 3, 5\}$, we use the Hecke-invariance of these subspaces proved in [21] to prove, for distinct primes $\ell$ and $m\geq 5$ and $j\geq 1$, congruences of the form $$ p_{[1, p]}\left(\frac{\ell^jm^k n + 1}{D}\right)\equiv 0 \pmod{\ell^j} $$ for all $n\geq 1$ with $m\nmid n$, where $k$ is explicitly computable and depends on the forms in the invariant subspace. Our proofs require adapting and extending analogous level one results on $p(n)$ in [1] and [22] to level $p$.</p></details>

Distinct local descriptions of a (singular) point correspond to distinct choices of $X$, giving rise to families of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs each without a Higgs branch. These local descriptions directly translate into nilpotency relations in the operator product expansions.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper provides a systematic study of symmetry properties for cyclotomic multiple Hurwitz zeta values with multiple variables and parameters by applying the methods of contour integration and the residue theorem. The main contributions are the derivation of explicit symmetry formulas for cyclotomic multiple (Hurwitz) zeta values, which are obtained directly through analytic residue calculations, without reliance on algebraic regularization. As a concrete application, we deduce analogous symmetry theorems for cyclotomic multiple zeta values and cyclotomic multiple $t$-values. The results extend and complement recent symmetry investigations by Charlton and Hoffman, offering completely explicit and regularization-free formulas in the convergent setting. Moreover, the results of this paper can be used to prove the symmetry conjecture for cyclotomic multiple Hurwitz zeta values with multiple variables and a single parameter. Furthermore, several illustrative corollaries and examples are included, and an open problem concerning possible extensions to other variants of multiple zeta values is posed at the conclusion.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A_q$ be the alternating central extension of the q-Onsager algebra, a comodule algebra over the quantum loop algebra of $sl_2$. We classify one-dimensional representations of $A_q$, and show that spin-j K-operators constructed in arXiv:2301.00781 act as K-matrices previously obtained in the literature. Using these K-operators and K-matrices, we construct universal spin-j transfer matrices generating commutative subalgebras in $A_q$. Within a technical conjecture, we derive their fusion hierarchy, the so-called universal TT-relations. On spin-chain representations of $A_q$, we show how the universal transfer matrices evaluate to spin-chain transfer matrices, and as a result we get explicit TT-relations for all values of spins for auxiliary and quantum spaces, any inhomogeneities, and general integrable boundary conditions. In particular, we derive previously conjectured TT-relations. Using the TT-relations, we show that n-th local conserved quantities of the spin-j chains of length N are polynomials of total degree 4Njn in two non-local operators of the q-Onsager algebra. As a result, we give an algorithm of explicit calculation of all local conserved quantities in terms of spin operators. Furthermore, using the universal TT-relations we derive exchange relations between spin-j Hamiltonians and the two non-local operators showing non-trivial symmetries for special boundary conditions, that they commute with all Hamiltonian densities. As another application of our universal TT-relations we propose universal T-system, Y-system and universal TQ-relations for $A_q$, and as a result, universal TQ for the q-Onsager algebra. For diagonal boundary conditions, we also obtain universal TT- and TQ-relations for a degenerate version of $A_q$ known as centrally extended augmented q-Onsager algebra. We finally discuss implications of our results for generalized Gibbs ensemble construction.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Sturm's theorem states that a modular form with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ can only have an explicitly bounded order of vanishing at infinity. This result is one of the most powerful computational tools in the study of modular forms, and has widespread applications to congruences and other kinds of explicit calculations in mathematics and physics. In this paper, we formulate a new ``$p$-adic transfer method" that lifts Sturm-type bounds from one space to another using exclusively non-geometric inputs. As an application, we transfer the Sturm bounds for classical modular forms to the space of quasimodular forms of level one. These bounds are applicable uniformly for quasimodular forms with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$, which extends the non-uniform results for $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ only which can be derived from classical theories. We also discuss the potential for future applications to other quasi- and mixed-weight modular objects, and perhaps even entirely non-modular objects.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the densities of the sets of abundant numbers and of covering numbers, integers $n$ for which there exists a distinct covering system where every modulus divides $n$. We establish that the set $\mathcal{C}$ of covering numbers possesses a natural density $d(\mathcal{C})$ and prove that $0.103230 < d(\mathcal{C}) < 0.103398.$ Our approach adapts methods developed by Behrend and Deléglise for bounding the density of abundant numbers, by introducing a function $c(n)$ that measures how close an integer $n$ is to being a covering number with the property that $c(n) \leq h(n) = σ(n)/n$. However, computing $d(\mathcal{C})$ to three decimal digits requires some new ideas to simplify the computations. As a byproduct of our methods, we obtain significantly improved bounds for $d(\mathcal{A})$, the density of abundant numbers, namely $0.247619608 < d(\mathcal{A}) < 0.247619658$. We also show the count of primitive covering numbers up to $x$ is $O\left( x\exp\left(\left(-\tfrac{1}{2\sqrt{\log 2}} + ε\right)\sqrt{\log x} \log \log x\right)\right)$, which is substantially smaller than the corresponding bound for primitive abundant numbers.</p></details>

This local-to-global regularity result holds for arbitrary Legendrian links and it is a key input for the study of cluster structures on such moduli spaces. Specifically, we construct regular functions on derived moduli stacks of sheaves with Legendrian microsupport by studying the Hochschild homology of the associated dg-categories via relative Lagrangian skeleta. In this construction, a key geometric result is that local microlocal merodromies along positive relative cycles in Lagrangian fillings yield global Hochschild 0-cycles for these dg-categories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a family of test kernels for use in spectral trace formulas on locally symmetric spaces. The key innovation is the factorization $h_T = g_T \star \widetilde{g}_T$, which simultaneously achieves: (i) automatic positive semi-definiteness of the spectral multiplier $m_{h_T}(π) = |m_{g_T}(π)|^2 \ge 0$; (ii) $J$-fold moment annihilation via a multi-scale Vandermonde construction, yielding super-polynomial decay of all error terms; (iii) uniform spectral parameter bounds (Master-Bound) $\mathfrak{E}_{\mathrm{tot}}(T) \ll T^{d+1-δ}$ with $δ> 0$ depending only on the symmetry order $k$ and the annihilation depth $J \asymp \sqrt{(\log T)/k}$, representing a power saving over the main term $\asymp T^{d+1}$. The cost is a controlled polynomial growth $T^{c_0^2/2+o(1)}$ in the Vandermonde coefficients (with exponent strictly less than 1), which is dominated by the super-polynomial decay of the off-diagonal terms. The construction is axiomatized over two analytic hypotheses -- a Weyl law and Bessel/Airy asymptotics -- making it applicable beyond the classical $\mathrm{GL}(2)$ setting.</p></details>

In part II we provide proofs of all statements (which we repeat to be as self contained as possible) concerning p-adic matrices

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is a sequel to arXiv:2501.14444, in which we shall give proofs of several results stated in arXiv:2501.14444 (Theorems D--L) which, for brevity and clarity, we postponed to this sequel paper. These results were the following: for any prime number $p$, first we show that every $2$-by-$2$ symmetric matrix with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ can be reduced to a canonical form, and we give the exact numbers of families of normal forms with one parameter and of isolated normal forms, which depend on $p$. Then we make the same analysis for $4$-by-$4$ matrices. We also prove that, for higher size, the number of families of normal forms of matrices, even in the non-degenerate case, grows almost exponentially with the size. The paper can be read independently of arXiv:2501.14444 as we recall the statements of arXiv:2501.14444 that we shall prove here. The statements and proofs of the present paper are of an algebraic and arithmetical nature, and rely mainly on Galois theory of $p$-adic extension fields.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 31 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any imaginary quadratic field $K$, the Galois group $G_K$ of its maximal unramified pro-$3$-extension is a Schur $σ$-group. If this has Zassenhaus type $(3,3)$, there are 13 possibilities for the isomorphism class of the finite quotient $G_K/D_4(G_K)$. We prove that for 10 of these 13 cases $G_K$ is either finite or isomorphic to an open subgroup of a form of $\mathop{\rm PGL}_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}_3$. Combined with the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture, or with earlier work on an analogue of the Cohen--Lenstra heuristic for Schur $σ$-groups, this lends credence to the "if" part of a conjecture of McLeman. Using explicit computations of triple Massey products, we also test the heuristic for all imaginary quadratic fields $K$ with $d(G_K)=2$ and discriminant $-10^8 < d_K < 0$ and find a reasonably good agreement.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study frequency moments of partition statistics arising from Euler products $A(q)=\prod_{r\ge1}(1-q^r)^{-c(r)}$ via a transform that expresses the moment generating functions as $B(q)$ times explicit divisor--sum series determined by $c(r)$. When $A(q)$ is modular (typically an $η$--quotient), this yields (quasi)modular forms whose coefficients can be projected to arithmetic progressions and certified modulo primes by a Sturm bound, giving an effective pipeline for detecting and proving Ramanujan--type congruences for frequency moments. For ordinary partitions we recover and certify several congruences for odd moments in nonzero residue classes (e.g.\ $M_3(7n+5)\equiv 0\pmod7$ and $M_3(11n+6)\equiv 0\pmod{11}$). As a second input, we apply the same pipeline to overpartitions and certify a family of zero--class congruences $M_m^{\overline{\ }}(\ell n)\equiv 0\pmod{\ell}$ (including $m=5,7,11,13$), exhibiting a sharp contrast with the ordinary partition case: no nonzero residue--class congruences are observed for overpartition moments in our scan range. We also demonstrate that filtering the statistic via the Glaisher--character dictionary can itself create new Ramanujan--type progressions, e.g.\ a quadratic twist yields the certified congruence $\widehat{M}^{χ_5}_3(5n+4)\equiv 0\pmod{5}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By the work of Hernandez-Leclerc, Leclerc-Plamondon, and Keller-Scherotzke, affine graded Nakajima quiver varieties associated with a Dynkin quiver $Q$ admit an algebraic description in terms of modules over the singular Nakajima category $\mathcal{S}$ and a stratification functor to the derived category of $Q$. In this paper, we extend this framework to Nakajima's $n$-fold affine graded tensor product varieties, which allow one to geometrically realize $n$-fold tensor products of standard modules over the quantum affine algebra. We introduce a category of filtrations with splitting of length $n$ of modules over a category and show that it is equivalent to the module category of a triangular matrix category. Applied to the singular Nakajima category, this yields a category $\mathcal{S}^{n\mathrm{-filt}}$ whose modules are parametrized by the points of the $n$-fold tensor product varieties. Generalizing the results of Keller-Scherotzke from $\mathcal{S}$ to $\mathcal{S}^{n\mathrm{-filt}}$, we prove that the stable category of pseudo-coherent Gorenstein projective $\mathcal{S}^{n\mathrm{-filt}}$-modules is triangle equivalent to the derived category of the algebra of $n \times n$ upper triangular matrices over the path algebra of $Q$, and we obtain a corresponding stratification functor.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Nous démontrons l'invariance Galoisienne de la propriété d'annulation en $1/2$ des fonctions L standard ou de Rankin-Selberg pour certaines représentations automorphes cuspidales algébriques régulières autoduales ou autoduales conjuguées de groupes linéaires sur un corps de nombres arbitraire. La démonstration repose sur l'utilisation de la cohomologie pondérée de Goresky-Harder-MacPherson et sur la construction de certaines représentations automorphes discrètes pour les groupes classiques comme résidus de séries d'Eisenstein. L'abandon de l'hypothèse ``$F$ totalement réel'' introduit de nouvelles difficultés concernant certains opérateurs d'entrelacement. Celles-ci sont résolues grâce à l'appendice, rédigé par J.-L. Waldspurger et l'un d'entre nous, démontrant l'holomorphie et la non-annulation de certains opérateurs d'entrelacement normalisés. Nous démontrons également l'invariance Galoisienne des facteurs epsilon correspondants, impliquant l'invariance Galoisienne de la parité de l'ordre d'annulation en $1/2$ de ces fonctions $L$. -- We prove the invariance under the Galois group of the vanishing at $1/2$ of standard and Rankin-Selberg L-functions for certain self-dual or conjugate self-dual algebraic cuspidal automorphic representations for general linear groups over an arbitrary number field. The proof uses Goresky-Harder-MacPherson weighted cohomology and the construction of certain discrete automorphic representations for classical groups as residues of Eisenstein series. New difficulties appear concerning certain intertwining operators. These are solved in the appendix by J.-L. Waldspurger and O. Taïbi proving the holomorphy and non-vanishing of these operators. We also prove the Galois invariance of epsilon factors, implying Galois invariance of the parity of the order at $1/2$ of L-functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a variety with a suitable Brauer class, we present a general pullback construction that produces varieties that has Brauer--Manin obstruction to the existence of rational points. We then study Severi--Brauer fibrations and their Brauer groups without relying on explicit defining equations. As a key application, we show that there exist Severi--Brauer fibrations with index one that fails Hasse principle.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a new method for combining two cotorsion pairs to obtain an abelian model structure and we apply it to construct and study a new model structure on left $R$-modules over a left coherent ring $R$. Its class of fibrant objects is generated by the weakly Ding injective $R$-modules, a class of modules recently studied by Iacob. We give several characterizations of the fibrant modules, one being that they are the cycle modules of certain acyclic complexes of FP-injective (i.e., absolutely pure) $R$-modules. In the case that $R$ is a Ding-Chen ring, we show that they are precisely the modules appearing as cycles of acyclic complexes of FP-injectives. This leads to a new description of the stable module category of a Ding-Chen ring $R$, by way of modules we call Gorenstein FP-pro-injective. These are modules that appear as a cycle module of a totally acyclic complex of FP-projective-injective modules. As a completely separate application of the new model category method, we show that all complete cotorsion pairs, even non-hereditary ones, lift to abelian models for the derived category of a ring.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In our previous paper with Tudor Pădurariu, we introduced the notion of limit categories for moduli stacks of Higgs bundles and formulated the Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence. These limit categories are expected to provide an effective ``classical limit'' of the categories of D-modules on the moduli stack of bundles, and our formulation links categorical Donaldson-Thomas theory with the geometric Langlands correspondence. In this paper, we prove the above Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence for $\GL_2$ over the locus in the Hitchin base where the spectral curves are reduced. This is the first non-trivial case in which the relevant moduli stacks are not quasi-compact, and the use of limit categories is essential to the formulation and proof of the correspondence. Our approach also outlines a strategy for proving the correspondence in greater generality and explains the current obstructions to such an extension.</p></details>
