 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Chiara Damiolini, Jiuzu Hong, Shuo Gao &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Added an appendix by Shuo Gao

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we investigate line bundles on $\mathrm{Bun}_{\mathcal{G}}$ the moduli stack of parahoric Bruhat--Tits bundles over a smooth projective curve. Translating this problem into one concerning twisted conformal blocks, we are able to establish criteria that detect when line bundles on an appropriate flag variety descend to $\mathrm{Bun}_{\mathcal{G}}$. Along the way we establish a conjecture of Pappas and Rapoport which describes sections of line bundles on $\mathrm{Bun}_{\mathcal{G}}$ using representation-theoretical means. We conclude the paper with examples where our methods allow us to explicitly determine the Picard group of $\mathrm{Bun}_{\mathcal{G}}$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Alexandra Florea &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages; expository article; to appear in the JLMS Centenary Special Issue

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this expository article, we review some of the ideas behind the work of Heath-Brown (D.~R. Heath-Brown, {\em Fractional moments of the Riemann Zeta Function}, J. Lond. Math. Soc., (2), {\bf 24}, no.1, (1981), 65--78) on upper and lower bounds for moments of the Riemann zeta-function, as well as the impact this work had on subsequent developments in the field. We survey recent results on the topic, which essentially recover the expected rate of growth for all moments - unconditionally for small moments and conditionally on the Riemann hypothesis for all larger moments.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 29 pages. We now use the terminology "Demu\v{s}kin group" also in the non-topologically finitely generated case, so that "p-manageable" is "p-Demu\v{s}kin + W90"

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\Gamma$ be either i) the absolute Galois group of a local field $F$, or ii) the topological fundamental group of a closed connected orientable surface of genus $g$. In case i), assume that $\mu_{p^2} \subset F$. We give an elementary and unified proof that every representation $\rho_1: \Gamma \to \mathbf{GL}_d(\mathbb{F}_p)$ lifts to a representation $\rho_2: \Gamma \to \mathbf{GL}_d(\mathbb{Z}/p^2)$. [In case i), it is understood these are continuous.] The actual statement is much stronger: for all $r \geq 1$, under "suitable" assumptions, triangular representations $\rho_r: \Gamma \to \mathbf{B}_d(\mathbb{Z}/p^r)$ lift to $\rho_{r+1}: \Gamma \to \mathbf{B}_d(\mathbb{Z}/p^{r+1})$, in the strongest possible step-by-step sense. Here "suitable" is made precise by the concept of $\textit{Kummer flag}$. An essential aspect of this work, is to identify the common properties of groups i) and ii), that suffice to ensure the existence of such lifts.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ken Ono &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1975, G. E. Andrews challenged the community to provide a proof that takes the summatory forms of the Rogers--Ramanujan $q$-series as input and directly establishes their modularity. This question is important because many different $q$-series appearing in combinatorics, representation theory, and physics often seem to be mysteriously modular, yet there is no general test to confirm this directly from the exotic $q$-series expressions. In this note, solve this general problem using $q$-series algebra and $q$-series systems of differential equations. Specifically, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for when holomorphic $q$-series on $|q|<1$ form a vector-valued modular function. This result offers a clear and conceptual path to modularity for "strange" $q$-series.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the reduced coaction Lie algebra $\mathfrak{rc}_0$, which is defined by an algebraic equation satisfied by the reduced coaction (an upgraded version of the necklace cobracket) and the skew-symmetric condition. We prove that the double shuffle Lie algebra $\mathfrak{dmr}_0$ together with the skew-symmetric condition injects to $\mathfrak{rc}_0$, and that $\mathfrak{rc}_0$ together with the krv1 equation injects to the Kashiwara-Vergne Lie algebra $\mathfrak{krv}_2$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given positive integers $h, N$ satisfying $1 \leqslant h \leqslant 2N^2$, we define $T(h,N)$ to be the number of $2\times 2$ integer matrices with determinant equal to $h$ whose entries lie in $[-N,N]$. Our first result states that for any $\varepsilon >0$, one has $$ T(h,N) = \frac{16}{\zeta(2)} N^2 \bigg( \sum_{d |h} \frac{1}{d} \bigg) + O_{\varepsilon}(N^{\varepsilon} (N+ h)).$$ This quantitatively improves upon recent work of Afifurrahman and Ganguly--Guria. We further show that when $N^{1 + \delta} \leqslant h \leqslant 2N^2$ for any fixed $\delta>0$, the error term above is of roughly the right order. Our second result delivers an asymptotic formula for $T(h,N)$ with square-root cancellation whenever $h = N^2 + O(N)$. This error term is much stronger than its corresponding analogue in the smoothened version of this problem. More generally, for any $\varepsilon >0$ and any $N,h \in \mathbb{N}$ with $1\leq h \leq 2N^2$, we prove that $$ T(h,N) = \bigg( \frac{8}{\zeta(2)} - 4 \bigg)N^2 \bigg( \sum_{d |h} \frac{1}{d} \bigg) + O_{\varepsilon}(N^{\varepsilon}(N+ |h-N^2|)). $$</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Brice Miayoka Moussolo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we present a method for computing rational points on hyperelliptic curves of genus~3 and isolated quadratic points on hyperelliptic curves of genus~2 and~3 whose Jacobians have rank~0. Our approach begins by computing the image of the Mordell--Weil group on the associated Kummer variety and then determining which of these points correspond to rational or isolated quadratic points on the curve. We have developed and implemented this algorithm using the computer algebra system \texttt{\texttt{Magma}}. The method takes advantage of structural properties specific to hyperelliptic curves and their Jacobians. We applied our algorithm to a large dataset, analyzing 7,396 genus~3 hyperelliptic curves and 12,075 genus~2 hyperelliptic curves.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yacine Ikhlef, Alexi Morin-Duchesne &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math-ph &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 62 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The periodic Temperley-Lieb category consists of connectivity diagrams drawn on a ring with $N$ and $N'$ nodes on the outer and inner boundary, respectively. We consider families of modules, namely sequences of modules $\mathsf{M}(N)$ over the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra for varying values of $N$, endowed with an action $\mathsf{M}(N') \to \mathsf{M}(N)$ of the diagrams. Examples of modules that can be organised into families are those arising in the RSOS model and in the XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain, as well as several others constructed from link states. We construct a fusion product which outputs a family of modules from any pair of families. Its definition is inspired from connectivity diagrams drawn on a disc with two holes. It is thus defined in a way to describe intermediate states in lattice correlation functions. We prove that this fusion product is a bifunctor, and that it is distributive, commutative, and associative.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 26 pages; comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We formulate a model for the average behaviour of ray class groups of real quadratic fields with respect to a fixed rational modulus, locally at a finite set $S$ of odd primes. To that end, we introduce Arakelov ray class groups of a number field, and postulate that, locally at $S$, the Arakelov ray class groups of real quadratic fields are distributed randomly with respect to a natural Cohen--Lenstra type probability measure. We show that our heuristics imply the Cohen--Lenstra heuristics on class groups of real quadratic fields, as well as equidistribution results on the fundamental unit of a real quadratic field modulo an integer, and are consistent with Varma's results on average of sizes of $3$-torsion subgroups of ray class groups of quardratic fields.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gil Moss, Justin Trias &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 27 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a nonarchimedean local field with residue field of cardinality $q$, let $G$ be the $F$-points of a connected reductive group defined over $F$, let $P$ and $Q$ be two parabolic subgroups with the same Levi factor $M$. We construct intertwining operators $J_{Q|P}$ and the Harish-Chandra $j$-function $j^G$ for finitely generated smooth $A[M]$-modules, where $A$ is any commutative Noetherian algebra over $\mathbb{Z}' :=\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{q}^{-1}]$. The construction is functorial, compatible with extension of scalars, and generalizes the previously known constructions. We prove a generic Schur's lemma result for parabolic induction, which circumvents the need for generic irreducibility in defining $j^G$. Setting $A=\mathbb{Z}'$ and applying the construction to finitely generated projective generators produces a universal $j$-function that is a rational function with coefficients in the Bernstein center of $M$ over $\mathbb{Z}'$, and which gives the $j$-function of any object via specializing at points of the Bernstein scheme. We conclude by characterizing the local Langlands in families morphism (when it exists) for quasisplit classical groups in terms of an equality of $j$-functions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Orlando Galdames-Bravo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 9 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Nicolas inequality we deal can be written as \begin{equation}\label{Nicineq} e^\gamma \log\log N_x < \dfrac{N_x}{\varphi(N_x)}\,, \end{equation} where $x\ge 2$, $N_x$ denotes the product of the primes less or equal than $x$, $\gamma$ is the Euler constant and $\varphi$ is the Euler totient function. We see that verification of such an inequality depends on the sign of the Big-o function in the Mertens estimate for the sum of reciprocals of primes that. Then we analyze the sign of such an error term.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this note, following Mui\'c-Savin, we compute the center of Kostant algebra, introduced by Kostant in 1975 as strongly commuting algebra. We explain how it encodes information on tensor products between a finite-dimensional and a Verma module, and about the structure of principal series representations via the work of Bernstein-Gelfand. We also discuss conjectured relationships to Langlands duality.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 33 pages, 8 tables; Supplementary code can be found on authors github (reference can be found in the document)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $L/K$ be a cyclic extension of number fields, and let $S$ be a finite set of places of $K$ containing the ramified and Archimedean ones. We say that $L/K$ has the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property if, for any generator $\sigma \in \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$, the kernel of the arithmetic norm map $\mathrm{cl}^S(L)\rightarrow \mathrm{cl}^S(K)$ coincides with $(1-\sigma)\mathrm{cl}^S(L)$. We establish an effective criterion for the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property and investigate its connections with Iwasawa theory, in particular its relation to the Gross--Kuz'min conjecture. This yields a new method for verifying the property by explicit computation, with further links to the theory of spins of prime ideals. We conjecture that in the totally real case the property fails for at most finitely many primes, and we present numerical evidence supporting a heuristic toward this conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we obtain under the assumption of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis upper bounds for all high integral moments of sums of Fourier coefficients of a given modular form twisted by quadratic Dirichlet characters.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce axioms for towers of infinite-dimensional algebras such that the corresponding Grothendieck groups of projective and finite-dimensional modules are Hopf dual to each other. This duality gives rise to an action of the Hesienberg double -- a generalization of the classical Hesienberg algebra -- on the Grothendieck group. We categorify this action and, as an application, construct a categorical realization of quantum differential operators on $\mathbb{A}^1_{\mathbb{Z}[v,v^{-1}]}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>What is the maximum number of $r$-term sums admitting rational values in $n$-element sets of irrational numbers? We determine the maximum when $r<4$ or $r\geq n/2$ and also in case when we drop the condition on the number of summands. It turns out that the $r$-term sum problem is equivalent to determine the maximum number of $r$-term zero-sum subsequences in $n$-element sequences of integers, which can be seen as a variant of the famous Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv theorem.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages, the associated code can be found in https://github.com/IgnasiSanchez/SymplecticCriteria

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\ell$ and $p \geq 3$ be different primes. Let $E/\mathbb{Q}_\ell$ and $E'/\mathbb{Q}_\ell$ be elliptic curves with isomorphic $p$-torsion. Assume that $E$ has potentially multiplicative reduction. We classify when all $G_{\mathbb{Q}_\ell}$-isomorphisms $\phi : E[p] \to E'[p]$ have the same symplectic type and prove two new criteria to determine the type in that case. In particular, when both curves have multiplicative reduction, our results cover the case of unramified $p$-torsion which is not covered by the original criterion due to Kraus and Oesterl\'e. We also give a variant of a symplectic criterion for the case when both $E$ and~$E'$ have good reduction and provide an algorithm to apply it. As an application, we determine the symplectic type of all the mod $p \geq 5$ congruences between rational elliptic curves with conductor $\leq 500 000$ that satisfy the hypothesis of either of our criteria at some prime~$\ell$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The moduli space $\mathcal{A}_g$ of principally polarised abelian varieties of dimension $g$, defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p >0$, is studied through various stratifications. The two most prominent ones are the Newton polygon stratification, based on the isogeny class of the $p$-divisible group of an abelian variety, and the Ekedahl-Oort stratification, defined by the isomorphism class of its $p$-torsion group scheme. In general, it is not known how the strata of these two intersect. In this paper we study intersections of the Ekedahl-Oort and Newton polygon stratification in dimension at most $5$. We give an explicit description of the Ekedahl-Oort stratification of the supersingular locus $\mathcal{S}_{5}$, and describe other $p$-rank zero intersections of the two stratifications. For intersections of positive $p$-rank, we describe all such intersections in dimensions at most $5$. Our proofs use Oort's minimality of $p$-divisible groups, as well as related results of Chai-Oort and Harashita. In addition to these, a new approach used in this paper is an inductive argument, based on understanding the Ekedahl-Oort type of products of abelian varieties and the known intersections in lower dimensions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Le Duc Hieu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** No figures. Includes a short appendix on a uniform short-interval BDH mean-square bound and a congruence-restricted dense-cluster lemma

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that once $\theta>17/30$, every sufficiently long interval $[x,x+x^\theta]$ contains many $k$-term arithmetic progressions of primes, uniformly in the starting point $x$. More precisely, for each fixed $k\ge3$ and $\theta>17/30$, for all sufficiently large $X$ and all $x\in[X,2X]$, $$ \#\{\text{$k$-APs of primes in }[x,x+x^\theta]\}\ \gg_{k,\theta}\ \frac{N^{2}}{\big((\varphi(W)/W)^{k}(\log R)^{k}\big)}\ \asymp\ \frac{X^{2\theta}}{(\log X)^{k+1+o(1)}}, $$ where $W:=\prod_{p\le \tfrac12\log\log X}p$, $N:=\lfloor x^\theta/W\rfloor$, and $R:=N^\eta$ for a small fixed $\eta=\eta(k,\theta)>0$. This is obtained by combining the uniform short-interval prime number theorem at exponents $\theta>17/30$ (a consequence of recent zero-density estimates of Guth and Maynard) with the Green-Tao transference principle (in the relative Szemer\'edi form) on a window-aligned $W$-tricked block.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study several rigidity properties of $p$-adic local systems on a smooth rigid analytic space $X$ over a $p$-adic field. We prove that the monodromy of the log isocrystal attached to a $p$-adic local system is ''rigid'' along irreducible components of the special fiber. Then we give several applications. First, suppose that $X$ has good reduction. We show that if a family of semistable representations is crystalline at one classical point on $X$, then it is crystalline everywhere. Second, combining with the $p$-adic monodromy theorem recently studied by the authors and their collaborators, we prove the following surprising rigidity result conjectured by Shankar: for any $p$-adic local system on a smooth projective variety with good reduction, if it is potentially crystalline at one classical point, then it is potentially crystalline everywhere. Finally, we show that if a $p$-adic local system on the complement of a reduced normal crossing divisor on a smooth rigid analytic space is crystalline at all classical points, then it extends uniquely to a $p$-adic local system on the entire space. In other words, such a local system cannot have geometric monodromy if it has no arithmetic monodromy everywhere on the complement of a reduced normal crossing divisor.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We generalize Derksen-Weyman-Zelevinsky's theory of quivers with potentials (QPs) to an $H$-based setting by considering quivers with exactly one loop at each vertex, asking the loops to be nilpotent and so attaching a truncated polynomial ring $H_i$ to each vertex. The algebra is then defined by taking the quotient of the complete path algebra by relations arising from analogs of the Jacobian ideals of a given potential. We develop the mutation theory for such $H$-based QPs and their decorated representations in general position. As an application, we consider generalized cluster algebras introduced by Chekhov-Shapiro. For those algebras corresponding to $H$-based quivers $(Q,\mathbf{d})$ that have mutation degree $d_k\leq 2$ at each vertex $k$ and admit nondegenerate potentials $S$ making $(Q,\mathbf{d},S)$ locally free, we provide a representation-theoretic interpretation of $\mathbf{g}$-vectors and $F$-polynomials. When the exchange matrix $B(Q)$ has full rank, we further construct generic character for upper generalized cluster algebras.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages. Comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that $\kgl$-linear cohomology theories over an affine Dedekind scheme $S$ admit a canonical weight filtration on resolvable motives without inverting residual characteristics. Combined with upcoming work of Annala--Hoyois--Iwasa, this endows essentially all known logarithmic cohomology theories with weight filtrations when evaluated on projective sncd pairs $(X,D)$ over $S$. Furthermore, the weight-filtered cohomology is an invariant of the open part $U = X-D$. On variants of de Rham cohomology, we show that our weight filtration recovers the d\'ecalaged pole-order filtration defined by Deligne. One interpretation of this is that the spectral sequence associated to the pole-order filtration is an invariant of $U$ from the $E_2$-page onwards, which generalizes a result of Deligne from characteristic 0 to positive and mixed characteristic, and suggests that ``mixed Hodge theory'' is a useful invariant of $S$-schemes. Finally, we compute explicit examples of weight filtered pieces of cohomology theories. One of the computations reproves a slight weakening of a result of Thuillier stating that the singular cohomology of the dual complex associated to the boundary divisor of a good projective compactification does not depend on the chosen compactification. In the appendix, we prove the folklore results that the Whitehead tower functor is fully faithful and that perfect bivariant pairings with respect to the twisted arrow category correspond to duality.</p></details>

Here we extend the inequalities by these authors to Jack and Macdonald polynomials, and obtain conjectural characterizations of majorization and of weak majorization of the underlying partitions. We prove these characterizations for several cases of partitions, including all partitions with two parts. In fact, we upgrade -- and prove in the above cases -- the characterization of majorization, to containment of Jack and Macdonald differences lying in the Muirhead semiring.</p></details>

In this article, we present the formalization of Harder-Narasimhan theory in the proof assistant Lean 4 with Mathlib. This formalization is based on a recent approach of Harder-Narasimhan theory by Chen and Jeannin, which reinterprets the theory in order-theoretic terms and avoids the classical dependence on algebraic geometry. As an application, we formalize the uniqueness of coprimary filtration of a finitely generated module over a noetherian ring, and the existence of the Jordan-H\"older filtration of a semistable Harder-Narasimhan game.

This phenomenon is precisely formulated in terms of semibricks. On the other hand, by applying the exchange property of odd reflections, we describe compositions of homomorphisms between Verma modules associated with different Borel subalgebras that share the same character.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the partition function of the WZW model with target a compact Lie group $G$ by adapting a method used by Choi and Takhtajan to compute the heat kernel of the group manifold. The basic idea is to compute the partition function of a supersymmetric version of the WZW model using a form of supersymmetric localization and then use the fact that, since the fermions of the supersymmetric WZW model are actually decoupled from the bosons, this also determines the partition function of the purely bosonic WZW model. The result is a formula for the partition function as a sum over contributions from abelian classical solutions. We verify for $G=SU(2)$ that this formula agrees with the result for the same partition function that comes from the Weyl-Kac character formula. We extend the method of supersymmetric localization to certain related models such as the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ WZW model and a Wick-rotated version of this model in which the target space is hyperbolic three-space $H_3^+$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A proof of Lagrange's and Jacobi's four-square theorem due to Hurwitz utilizes orders in a quaternion algebra over the rationals. Seeking a generalization of this technique to orders over number fields, we identify two key components: an order with a good factorization theory and the condition that all orbits under the action of the group of elements of norm $1$ acting by multiplication intersect the suborder corresponding to the quadratic form to be studied. We use recent results on class numbers of quaternion orders and then find all suborders satisfying the orbit condition. Subsequently, we obtain universality and formulas for the number of representations by the corresponding quadratic forms. We also present a quaternionic proof of G\"otzky's four-square theorem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Despite the prevalence of symmetry in scientific linear systems, these structural properties are often underutilized by standard computational software. This paper introduces PySymmetry, an open-source Sage/Python framework that implements classical representation theory to simplify G-equivariant linear systems. PySymmetry uses projection operators to generate symmetry-adapted bases, transforming equivariant operators into a more efficient block-diagonal form. Its functionalities include defining and reducing representations, calculating multiplicities, and obtaining the explicit block structure. We demonstrate PySymmetry's versatility through three case studies: a chemistry application, a numerical benchmark on the non-Hermitian Schr\"odinger equation that achieved a performance increase of over 17x compared to standard methods, and a symbolic investigation that enabled the first complete analytical classification of a challenging problem in celestial mechanics. Designed for seamless integration with libraries like NumPy and SciPy, PySymmetry offers a powerful, user-friendly tool for exploring symmetries in theoretical and applied contexts. ```</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study categories whose objects are the braid representations, i.e. strict monoidal functors $F\colon B\rightarrow Mat$ from the braid category $B$ to the category of matrices $Mat$. Braid representations are equivalent to solutions to the (constant) Yang-Baxter equation. A major part of the contribution here is to introduce, compare, and contrast suitable notions of isomorphism of representations. A significant contribution here is an extensive range of key examples and counterexamples. Our approach is mainly motivated by the recent classification of charge conserving Yang-Baxter operators, in which the target $Mat$ is replaced by the subcategory $Match^N$. One objective is to understand from the categorical perspective how the classification was facilitated by this change (with the aim of generalising). Progress is made here by observing that the category of functors $MonFun(B,Mat)$ is itself a monoidal category (Theorem 5.3). In addition, we introduce the notion of sub and quotient objects, proving that an object that is both sub and quotient corresponds to an endomorphism in $MonFun(B,Mat)$ (Theorem 5.18). We also observe that objects with target $Match^N$ always have sub and quotient objects. This monoidal category leads us to consider monoidal subcategories whose objects share a given property, giving rise to a new way to see how group-type and involutive solutions, for example, fit into our framework. Another objective is to understand how universal such a restricted target is. Here we give various properties exposing the implications of different choices of equivalence and describe some relationships among them (Theorem 7.18, Theorem 7.9, Conj. 7.19, Conj. 7.22). A key result of this paper is Th.2.9, which shows that, in a `sufficiently free' setting including our case, every monoidal functor is equivalent to a strict one.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Walled Brauer algebras $B_N ( m , n ) $ illuminate the combinatorics of mixed tensor representations of $U(N)$, with $m$ copies of the fundamental and $n$ copies of the anti-fundamental representation. They lie at the intersection of research in representation theory, AdS/CFT and quantum information theory. They have been used to study of correlators in multi-matrix models motivated by brane-anti-brane physics in AdS/CFT. They have been applied in computing and optimising fidelities of port-based quantum teleportation. There is a large $N$ regime, specifically $ N \ge (m+n)$ where the algebras are semi-simple and their representation theory more tractable. There are known combinatorial formulae for dimensions of irreducible representations and associated reduction multiplicities. The large $N$ regime has a stability property whereby these formulae are independent of $N$. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the combinatorics in the non-semisimple regime of $ N = m +n - l $, with positive $l$. We introduce restricted Bratteli diagrams (RBD) which are useful as an instrument to process known data from the large $N$ regime to calculate representation theory data in the non-semisimple regime. We identify within the non-semisimple regime, a region of $(m,n)$-stability, where $ \min ( m, n ) \ge ( 2l -3) $ and the RBD take a stable form depending on $l$ only and not the choice of $ m,n$ within the region. In this regime, several aspects of the combinatorics of the RBD are controlled by a universal partition function for an infinite tower of simple harmonic oscillators closely related, but not identical, to the partition function of 2D non-chiral free scalar field theory.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yeor Hafouta &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.PR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\cP$ be the set of prime numbers, and $X_p,\, p\in\cP$ be a sequence of independent random variables such that $\bbP(X_p=\pm 1)=1/2$. Let $(\te_j)_{j=1}^{\infty}$ the corresponding random multiplicative functions of Radamacher type, namely, $\te_j=\prod_{p|j}X_p$ if $j$ is square free and $\te_j=0$ otherwise. The motivation behind considering these variables comes from the Riemann Hypothesis since $(\te_\ell)$ can be viewed as the random counterpart of the M\"obius function $\mu(\ell)$ and the RH is equivalent to $\sum_{\ell\leq n}\mu(\ell)=o(n^{1/2+\varepsilon}), \forall \varepsilon>0$. Denote $S_n=\sum_{\ell=1}^n\te_\ell$. It is a natural guiding conjecture that $S_n/\sqrt n$ obeys the central limit theorem (CLT). However, S. Chatterjee conjectured (as expressed in \cite{[25]}) that the CLT should not hold. Chatterjee's conjecture was proved by Harper \cite{[17]}, and by now it is a direct consequence of a more recent breakthrough by Harper \cite{Har20} that $\frac{S_n}{\sqrt n}\to 0$ in distribution. Nevertheless, the question whether there exists a sequence $a_n=o(\sqrt n)$ such that $S_n/a_n$ converges to some limit remains a mystery. In this paper we, in particular, show that the answer is negative. Our proof is based on trigonometric identities, Levi's continuity theorem, the prime numbers theorem and the growth rates of the prime omega function $\om(n)$. Combining these tools we show that if a weak limit exists then the characteristic function of $S_n/a_n$ must converge to $0$ at any nonzero point. As a byproduct of our method we are also able to provide essentially optimal upper bounds on high order moments similar to \cite{Har19}, using different methods and for more general $X_p$'s.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Geil-Matsumoto bound (GM bound) constrains the number of rational points on a curve over a finite field in terms of the Weierstrass semigroup of any of the points on the curve. For general numerical semigroups, the GM bound lacks a simple closed-form expression, making its computation a challenging problem. A closed formula has been obtained for the case when the semigroup is generated by two co-prime integers. In this work, for any numerical semigroup, we provide a closed formula for the GM bound in terms of the Ap\'ery set of a nonzero element of the semigroup. In the case where the numerical semigroup is generated by consecutive integers $n, n+1, \dots, n+t$ with $\lceil\textstyle\frac{n-1}{2}\rceil\leq t \leq n-1$, we obtain a simple closed formula for the bound. We apply these results to obtain upper bounds on the number of rational points for algebraic curves over finite fields. In some cases, the GM bound improves some well-known upper bounds on the number of rational points.</p></details>

Finally we show $\int_{\mathbb{X}}\psi(z)f^{2}(z)g(z)d\mu z = o(1)$ in the range $|t_{f} - t_{g}| \leq t_{f}^{2/3-\varepsilon}$ where $f,g$ are two Hecke-Maass cusp forms.</p></details>

The idea of our construction is motivated by the Ohno-Zagier formula, which is elucidated through the relationship between the hypergeometric differential equation and the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equation. We develop a rigorous framework for the residue-wise analytic prolongation of our $p$-adic hypergeometric function by exploring its relationship with $p$-adic multiple polylogarithms. Through a detailed analysis of its local behavior near the point $1$, we show a $p$-adic version of Gauss hypergeometric theorem for the function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a new connection between the iHowe duality of type AIII established by Luo-Xu and the iSchur duality established by Bao-Wang. We show that iweight $\overline{\rho}$ space in the iHowe duality is naturally isomorphic to the tensor space in the iSchur duality. Under this isomorphism, we show that the relative braid group action on this iweight space coincides with the action of the type B Hecke algebra in the iSchur duality. As a consequence, we derive from multiplicity-free decompositions that the iweight $\overline{\rho}$ spaces of irreducible modules over iquantum groups are irreducible modules over the type B Hecke algebra. Meanwhile, in the iHowe duality, we identify the relative braid group action from one side with the action of $K$-matrices and $R$-matrices from the other side.</p></details>

> **Comment:** It replaces the manuscript titled "Emerton-Gee stacks for tame groups, II"

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct the parabolic version and the reductive version of the integral de Rham moduli stacks of Langlands parameters ($p>3$). We allow the group to be arbitrarily ramified. We propose that the top Chow group of the reduced Emerton-Gee stack $\mathcal{X}_{^L\!G}$ is isomorphic to that of the moduli of Weil-Deligne representations valued in $^L\!B$, where $^L\!B$ is a Borel of $^L\!G$. The latter bears a concrete description by Serre weights corrected by the Kottwitz homomorphism. We explicitly define such a map using parabolic de Rham moduli stacks as the composition of a chain of tautological maps, and confirm it is an isomorphism for (1) algebraic tori, (2) unitary, orthogonal and symplectic groups, (3) tame groups when restricted to the cyclotomic-free part of the Chow groups.</p></details>

We show that, for any such function field, Hilbert's 10th Problem has a negative answer, the valuation rings containing $K$ are uniformly existentially definable, and finitely generated integrally closed $K$-subalgebras are definable by a universal-existential formula. In order to obtain these results, we develop further the usage of local-global principles for quadratic forms in function fields to definability of certain subrings. We include a first systematic presentation of this general method, without restriction on the characteristic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The U-dualities of maximally supersymmetric non-chiral supergravity (SUGRA) theories lead to strong constraints on the non-perturbative structure of quantum gravity. In this paper we determine Spin- and Pin-lifts of these dualities, which extend this action to fermionic degrees of freedom. Among other things, this allows us to access non-supersymmetric sectors of these low energy effective field theories in which bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom are treated differently. We use this refinement of the duality groups, in tandem with the Swampland Cobordism Conjecture, to predict new codimension-two branes. These are a natural generalization of the recently discovered R7-branes of type II string theories. The first bordism groups for Spin-twisted duality bundles follow directly from the Abelianization of the duality groups. Viewing the SUGRA theory as the low energy limit of a toroidal compactification of M-theory, winding around these codimension-two defects enacts a reflection around one of the torus directions, which in the effective field theory appears as a charge conjugation symmetry. We establish some basic properties of such branes, including determining BPS objects which can end on it, as well as braiding rules and bound states realized by multiple reflection branes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Inspired by the foundational work of Bezrukavnikov and Chan \cite{BC24} on character sheaves for parahoric subgroups and an alternative interpretation of deep level Deligne-Lusztig characters in \cite{Nie_24}, we present a parallel but closed (non-iterated) construction of character sheaves within the framework of J.--K. Yu's types. We show that our construction yields perverse sheaves, which coincide with those produced in \cite{BC24} in an iterated way. In the regular case we establish the compatibility of their Frobenius traces with deep level Deligne-Lusztig characters. As an application, we prove the positive-depth Springer's hypothesis for arbitrary characters, thereby generalizing the generic case result of Chan and Oi \cite{CO25}. The proofs of our results make critical use of the strategies and results from \cite{BC24} and \cite{Nie_24}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a calculus based on graph enumeration for calculating $S_n$-equivariant motivic invariants of graphically stratified moduli spaces. We apply our theory to the Deligne--Mumford moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}$ and to the space of torus-fixed stable maps $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}(X, \beta)^{\mathbb{C}^\star}$ when the target $X$ admits an appropriate $\mathbb{C}^\star$-action, deriving new formulas in each case. A key role is played by the P\'olya--Petersen character of a graph, which enriches P\'olya's classical cycle index polynomial. This character is valued in an algebra $\Lambda^{[2]}$ of wreath product symmetric functions, which we study from combinatorial and representation--theoretic perspectives. We prove that this algebra may be viewed as the Grothendieck ring of the category of polynomial functors which take symmetric sequences of vector spaces to vector spaces, building on foundational work of Macdonald. This leads to a plethystic action of $\Lambda^{[2]}$ on the ring $\Lambda$ of ordinary symmetric functions. Using this action, we derive our formulas, which ultimately involve only ordinary symmetric functions and the Grothendieck ring of mixed Hodge structures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The conformal bootstrap in physics has recently been adapted to prove remarkably sharp estimates on Laplace eigenvalues and triple correlations of automorphic forms on compact hyperbolic surfaces. These estimates derive from an infinite family of algebraic equations satisfied by this spectral data. The equations encode $G$-equivariance and associativity of multiplication on $\Gamma \backslash G$, for $\Gamma$ a cocompact lattice in $G = \text{PSL}_2(\mathbf{R})$. The effectiveness of the conformal bootstrap suggests that the equations characterize hyperbolic surface spectra, i.e., that every solution to the equations comes from a compact hyperbolic surface. This paper proves this rigorously with no analytic assumptions on the solution except discreteness of the spectrum. The key intermediate result is an axiomatic characterization of representations of $G$ of the form $L^2(\Gamma \backslash G)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a recently discovered carrollian bosonic string, described classically by a sigma model where both the worldsheet and the target spacetime are carrollian. After fixing the carrollian analogue of the conformal gauge, we determine the Lie algebra of residual gauge symmetries and show it is isomorphic to the three-dimensional extended BMS algebra. We quantise the sigma model \`a la BRST and determine the spectrum of the corresponding string theory by computing the BRST cohomology. In contrast with the usual bosonic string, the spectrum of the carrollian string is finite-dimensional. The cohomology displays Poincar\'e duality and can be interpreted, for a given momentum, as inducing representations for unitary irreducible representations of the 26-dimensional Carroll group. Furthermore we interpret (most of) the cohomology as deformations of the spacetime carrollian structure augmented by the Kalb--Ramond field to which the carrollian string couples.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 33 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we provide a simple way to construct $d$-abelian categories via bounded derived categories for certain values of $d$. Namely, let ${\mathcal C}$ be an abelian category, and let ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ denote the full subcategory of the bounded derived category of ${\mathcal C}$ whose objects $X$ satisfy that $H_*(X)$ is concentrated in degrees $j$ where $0 \leq j \leq m$. We prove that if ${\mathcal C}$ is hereditary, then ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ is a $d$-abelian category where $d = 3m + 1$. Beyond offering a uniform method for constructing $d$-abelian categories, this construction allows us to create $d$-abelian categories that exhibit some unexpected properties depending on the choice of the category ${\mathcal C}$. For instance, if ${\mathcal C}$ is the category of abelian groups, then ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ is a $d$-abelian category which is not $\mathbb{K}$-linear over a field $\mathbb{K}$ but has set indexed products and coproducts. Similarly, if ${\mathcal C}$ is the category of coherent sheaves over certain algebraic curves, then ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ is a $d$-abelian category without enough injectives. We extend our results to $(n+2)$-angulated categories. Namely, let $M$ be an $n$-cluster tilting object over an $n$-representation finite algebra and let ${\mathcal T}$ be the corresponding $(n+2)$-angulated category with $n$-suspension functor $\Sigma_n$. We prove that the full subcategory ${\mathcal T}[0,m] = \mathrm{add} \bigoplus^{m}_{j=0}\Sigma^j_n M$ is a $d$-abelian category where $d = (n+2)(m+1)-2$. Furthermore, we show that there is a bijection between the functorially finite wide subcategories of $\mathrm{add}\,M$ and the functorially finite repetitive wide subcategories of ${\mathcal T}[0,m]$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$, the ratio set or the quotient set of $A$ is defined by $R(A):=\{a/b: a, b\in A, b\neq 0\}$. It is an open problem to study the denseness of $R(A)$ in the $p$-adic numbers when $A$ is the set of values attained by an integral form. In this paper, we consider the question of whether this happens for all but finitely many $p$. We prove that if a form is non-singular and has at least three variables, then the ratio set of its values is dense in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for all sufficiently large $p$. We conjecture that the same statement is true for non-degenerate forms of prime degree having sufficiently many variables, which is indeed the case when the degree is 2, 3, or 5. Still, we give two counterexamples when the assumptions of the conjecture are not satisfied. The first one happens when the number of variables is equal to the degree. The other works for any number of variables but only for composite degrees. Our innovation is to consider the problem in terms of varieties defined by forms, thereby using the tools from algebraic geometry, making their first appearance in this setting. Finally, we construct integral forms such that the ratio set of its values is dense in at least one $\mathbb{Q}_p$ but only in finitely many of them.</p></details>

In this paper, we contribute to this direction by giving an explicit enumeration of all solutions to the Pell equation inside the square $|x| + |y| \leq \lambda$ for any $\lambda > 0$. We further extend our results to the shifted Pell equation $\left(x-a\right)^2 - D\left(y-b\right)^2 = 1$ for integers $a$ and $b$, obtaining exact counts for sufficiently large $\lambda$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to undertake an in-depth study of the phenomenon behind the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem, which, in its modern form due to Kamae and Mend\`es-France, states that if $E$ is a set of integers with positive density and $P$ is an intersective polynomial, then there are distinct elements $x, y \in E$ such that $x - y = P(n)$ for some some $n$. In this paper, we identify an algebraic framework (rings of integers of global fields) for Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy-type theorems. One of our main results establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for a polynomial to satisfy the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over the ring of integers of a global field, providing an extension of the result of Kamae and Mend\`es-France. The Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy phenomenon goes beyond infinite rings and has interesting additional aspects in finite rings. As an example, classical exponential sum estimates can be used to show that large subsets of finite fields contain the asymptotically ``correct'' number of pairs $(x,y)$ whose difference is a square. In previous work, the class of polynomials satisfying this strong form of the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over finite fields was classified. In the present paper, we establish asymptotic results characterizing sequences of finite principal ideal rings that produce ``correct'' statistics in the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem and show that these families are much more general than finite fields. As an application of our enhanced forms of the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over finite rings, we produce new families of examples of quasirandom graphs of algebraic origin. The production of these new examples hinges on a two-way connection between asymptotic total ergodicity -- the phenomenon responsible for enhanced versions of the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over finite fields and rings -- and quasirandomness.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We suggest a new algorithm to estimate representations of compact Lie groups from finite samples of their orbits. Different from other reported techniques, our method allows the retrieval of the precise representation type as a direct sum of irreducible representations. Moreover, the knowledge of the representation type permits the reconstruction of its orbit, which is useful for identifying the Lie group that generates the action, from a finite list of candidates. Our algorithm is general for any compact Lie group, but only instantiations for SO(2), T^d, SU(2), and SO(3) are considered. Theoretical guarantees of robustness in terms of Hausdorff and Wasserstein distances are derived. Our tools are drawn from geometric measure theory, computational geometry, and optimization on matrix manifolds. The algorithm is tested for synthetic data up to dimension 32, as well as real-life applications in image analysis, harmonic analysis, density estimation, equivariant neural networks, chemical conformational spaces, and classical mechanics systems, achieving very accurate results.</p></details>

We first show that the Grothendieck group isomorphism induced by a tilting module can be realized via the $G$-matrix of this tilting module. Building on this, we compare $g$-vectors for a tilted algebra and its associated hereditary algebra, and provide $G$-matrix interpretations of the Coxeter transformation, the Nakayama functor, and the Auslander-Reiten translation for suitable algebras. Furthermore, we demonstrate that every element of any symmetric group and Weyl group can be expressed as the transpose of the $G$-matrix of some tilting module or support $\tau$-tilting module. Finally, we show that the Grothendieck group isomorphism induced by a $2$-term silting complex can also be realized via the $G$-matrix of this $2$-term silting complex.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We continue work started in [1] concerning integer sequences q(n), n in N, defined by q(n) = q(n-q(n-1)) + f(n), with q(1) = 1. Here, f(n), with f(1) = 0, is a given sequence. We define F as the set of semi-infinite sequence f such that the resulting sequence q exists. This requires that the term q(n-q(n-1)) be defined for all n, that is, 0 < q(n) < n+1 applies for all n in N.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\overline{p}_{k}(n)$ denote the number of overpartition $k$-tuples of $n$. In 2023, Saikia \cite{saikia} conjectured the following congruences: \begin{align*} \overline{p}_{q}(8n+2)& \equiv 0 \pmod{4},\quad \overline{p}_{q}(8n+3)\equiv 0 \pmod{8},\quad \overline{p}_{q}(8n+4) \equiv 0 \pmod{2},\\ \overline{p}_{q}(8n+5)& \equiv 0 \pmod{8},\quad \overline{p}_{q}(8n+6) \equiv 0 \pmod{8},\quad \overline{p}_{q}(8n+7)\equiv 0 \pmod{32}, \end{align*} where $n\geq0$ and $q$ is prime. Recently, Sellers \cite{sellers2024elementary} showed that these congruences hold for all odd integers $q$ (not necessarily prime). In this paper, we show that the above congruences hold for all positive integers $q$ (not necessarily odd). We also prove the following congruences on $\overline{OPT}_k(n)$, the number of overpartition $k$-tuples with odd parts of $n$: For all $i,j\geq 1$, $n\geq 0$, $r$ not a multiple of 2, $k$ not a multiple of 2 or 3, and $\ell$ not a power of 2, nor a multiple of 2 or 3, we have \begin{align*} \overline{OPT}_{2^i\cdot r}(8n+7)& \equiv 0 \pmod{2^{i+4}}, \overline{OPT}_{3^i\cdot 2^j\cdot k}(3n+2)& \equiv 0 \pmod{3^{i+1}\cdot 2^{j+2}}, \overline{OPT}_{3^i\cdot 2^j\cdot k}(3n+1)& \equiv 0 \pmod{3^{i}\cdot 2^{j+1}},\\ \overline{OPT}_{3^i\cdot \ell}(3n+2)& \equiv 0 \pmod{3^{i+1}\cdot 2}, \overline{OPT}_{3^i\cdot \ell}(3n+1)& \equiv 0 \pmod{3^{i}\cdot 2},\end{align*} where the first congruence was posed as a conjecture by Sarma et al. \cite{saikiasarma} and the latter four were conjectured by Das et al. \cite{DSS}.</p></details>
