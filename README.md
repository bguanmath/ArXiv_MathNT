| 2025-07-17 | **On an entropic analogue of additive energy** | Marcel K. Goh | math.CO | <a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18798v3'>2406.18798</a> |

> **Comment:** 21 pages, including references
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recent advances have linked various statements involving sumsets and cardinalities with corresponding statements involving sums of random variables and entropies. In this vein, this paper shows that the quantity $2{\bf H}\{X, Y\} - {\bf H}\{X+Y\}$ is a natural entropic analogue of the additive energy $E(A,B)$ between two sets. We develop some basic theory surrounding this quantity, and demonstrate its role in the proof of Tao's entropy variant of the Balog--Szemer\'edi--Gowers theorem. We examine the regime where entropic additive energy is small, and discuss a family of random variables related to Sidon sets. In finite fields, one can define an entropic multiplicative energy as well, and we formulate sum-product-type conjectures relating these two entropic energies.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This version improves significantly over the previous one, generalizing the results to essentially arbitrary unramified groups (see Section 1.5 for discussion of changes). Includes a new appendix written jointly with Zhongyipan Lin
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Breuil-M\'{e}zard Conjecture predicts the existence of hypothetical "Breuil-Mezard cycles" in the moduli space of mod $p$ Galois representations of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_q/\mathbb{Q}_q)$ that should govern congruences between mod $p$ automorphic forms. For generic parameters, we propose a construction of Breuil-M\'{e}zard cycles in arbitrary rank, and verify that they satisfy the Breuil-M\'{e}zard Conjecture for all sufficiently generic tame types and small Hodge-Tate weights. Our method is purely local and group-theoretic, and completely distinct from previous approaches to the Breuil-M\'ezard Conjecture. In particular, we leverage new connections between the Breuil-M\'ezard Conjecture and phenomena occurring in homological mirror symmetry and geometric representation theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages, comments welcome
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct natural extensions of the Kudla--Millson generating series of cohomology classes of special cycles in compactified unitary Shimura varieties of signature $(n+1,1)$ and prove that they are holomorphic Hermitian modular forms. This proves the cohomological version of a conjecture of Kudla and Bruinier--Rosu--Zemel, in all codimensions up to the middle. We also develop the theory of Hermitian quasi-modular forms, with a particular focus on polynomial weighted theta functions, and prove that the generating series of Zariski closures of special cycles is a Hermitian quasi-modular form.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2 uploaded to correct some citation mistakes; Published in Communications in Algebra
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given an odd prime $q$, a natural number $l$ and non-zero $q$-free integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{l}$, none of which are equal to $1$ or $-1$, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the polynomial $\prod_{j=1}^{l} (x^{q} - a_{j})$ to have roots modulo every positive integer. Consequently: (i) if $l \leq q$ and none of $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{l}$ is a perfect $q^{th}$ power, then the polynomial $\prod_{j=1}^{l} (x^{q} - a_{j})$ fails to have roots modulo some positive integer; $(ii)$ For every $l\in\mathbb{N}$, and every $(c_{j})_{j=1}^{l}\in\big(\mathbb{F}_{q}\setminus\{0\}\big)^{l}$, the polynomial $\prod_{j=1}^{l} (x^{q} - a_{j})$ has roots modulo every positive integer if and only if $\prod_{j=1}^{l} (x^{q} - \text{rad}_{q}\big(a_{j}^{c_{j}}\big)))$ has roots modulo every positive integer. Here $\text{rad}_{q}(a_{j})$ denotes the $q$-free part of the integer $a_{j}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Improved; 10 pages
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is an open problem in additive number theory to compute and understand the full range of sumset sizes of finite sets of integers, that is, the set $\mathcal{R}_{\mathbf{Z}}(h,k)= \{|hA|:A \subseteq {\mathbf{Z}} \text{ and } |A|=k\}$ for all integers $h \geq 3$ and $k \geq 3$. This paper constructs certain infinite families of finite sets of size $k$ and computes their $h$-fold sumset sizes.</p></details>
| 2025-07-17 | **Distributions of Ulam Words up to Length 30** | Paul Adutwum, Hopper Clark, Ro Emerson, Alexandra, Sheydvasser, Arseniy, Sheydvasser, Axelle Tougouma | math.NT | <a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01217v2'>2410.01217</a> |
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We further explore the notion of Ulam words considered by Bade, Cui, Labelle, and Li, giving some lower bounds on how many there are of a given length. Gaps between words and words of special type also reveal remarkable structure. By substantially increasing the number of computed terms, we are also able to sharpen some of the conjectures made by Bade et al.</p></details>
| 2025-07-17 | **Andrews--Gordon and Stanton type identities: bijective and Bailey lemma approaches** | Jehanne Dousse, Jihyeug Jang, Frédéric Jouhet | math.CO | <a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13239v1'>2507.13239</a> |

> **Comment:** 33 pages, 2 figures
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2018, Stanton proved two types of generalisations of the celebrated Andrews--Gordon and Bressoud identities (in their $q$-series version): one with a similar shape to the original identities, and one involving binomial coefficients. In this paper, we give new proofs of these identities. For the non-binomial identities, we give bijective proofs using the original Andrews--Gordon and Bressoud identities as key ingredients. These proofs are based on particle motion introduced by Warnaar and extended by the first and third authors and Konan. For the binomial identities, we use the Bailey lemma and key lemmas of McLaughlin and Lovejoy, and the order in which we apply the different lemmas plays a central role in the result. We also give an alternative proof of the non-binomial identities using the Bailey lattice. With each of these proofs, new Stanton-type generalisations of classical identities arise naturally, such as generalisations of Kur\c{s}ung\"oz's analogue of Bressoud's identity with opposite parity conditions, and of the Bressoud--G\"ollnitz--Gordon identities.</p></details>
| 2025-07-17 | **Vertex functions for bow varieties and their Mirror Symmetry** | Tommaso Maria Botta, Hunter Dinkins | math.AG | <a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13219v1'>2507.13219</a> |

> **Comment:** 56 pages. Comments very welcome!
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the vertex functions of finite type $A$ bow varieties. Vertex functions are $K$-theoretic analogs of $I$-functions, and 3d mirror symmetry predicts that the $q$-difference equations satisfied by the vertex functions of a variety and its 3d mirror dual are the same after a change of variable swapping the roles of the various parameters. Thus the vertex functions are related by a matrix of elliptic functions, which is expected to be the elliptic stable envelope of M. Aganagic and A. Okounkov. We prove all of these statements. The strategy of our proof is to reduce to the case of cotangent bundles of complete flag varieties, for which the $q$-difference equations can be explicitly identified with Macdonald difference equations. A key ingredient in this reduction, of independent interest, involves relating vertex functions of the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety with those of a ``finer" flag variety. Our formula involves specializing certain K\"ahler parameters (also called Novikov parameters) to singularities of the vertex functions. In the $\hbar \to \infty$ limit, this statement is expected to degenerate to an analogous result about $I$-functions of flag varieties.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 48 pages + 8 tables. Comments welcome!
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a classification of the degrees of the points with rational $j$-invariant on the modular curves $X_{0}(n)$ and $X_{1}(n)$. The degrees which occur infinitely often are computed unconditionally, while those which occur finitely often are determined assuming a conjecture of Zywina. To achieve this, we define the notion of $\mathcal{H}$-closures of subgroups of $\operatorname{GL}_{2}(\widehat{\mathbb{Z}})$, and compute the $\mathcal{B}_{0}(n)$- and $\mathcal{B}_{1}(n)$-closures of images of Galois representations of elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. An application to computing the set of isolated $j$-invariants in $\mathbb{Q}$ is also given.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: changed the level of generality of Theorem A, Proposition B, and several statements in Section 3 due to an error in the previous Lemma 3.5 (now corrected as Lemma 3.6); added a counterexample to the previous version of Theorem A; expanded discussion of related work and open problems; improved exposition and corrected typos; added references and acknowledgements. 27 pages, 4 figures
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by constructions from applied topology, there has been recent interest in the homological algebra of linear representations of posets, particularly in the context of homological algebra relative to non-standard exact structures. A prominent example is the spread exact structure on the category of representations of a fixed poset, in which the indecomposable projectives are the spread representations (that is, the indicator representations of convex and connected subsets). The spread-global dimension is known to be finite for finite posets and not uniformly bounded on the collection of all Cartesian products between two arbitrary finite total orders. It was conjectured in [AENY23] that the spread-global dimension is uniformly bounded on the collection of all Cartesian products between a fixed finite total order and an arbitrary finite total order. We provide a positive answer to this conjecture and, more generally, prove that the spread-global dimension is uniformly bounded on the collection of all Cartesian products between a fixed finite poset and an arbitrary finite total order. In doing so, we also establish the existence of finite spread-resolutions for finitely presented representations of arbitrary grid posets.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 79 pages. Introduction and several sections rewritten. No mathematical changes except in the dynamical section, where semipositivity assumptions were removed
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the asymptotic distribution of the Galois orbits of generic sequences of algebraic points of small height in a projective variety over a number field. Our main result is a generalization of Yuan's equidistribution theorem that applies to heights for which Zhang's lower bound for the essential minimum is not necessarily an equality. It extends to all projective varieties a theorem of Burgos Gil, Philippon, Rivera-Letelier and the second author for toric varieties. It also applies to sums of canonical heights for an algebraic dynamical system, and in particular it recovers K\"uhne's semiabelian equidistribution theorem. We also generalize previous work of Chambert-Loir and Thuillier to obtain new logarithmic equidistribution results. Finally we extend our main result to the quasi-projective setting recently introduced by Yuan and Zhang.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 14 Pages, fixed minor errors and edited many parts of the paper. Slight change in the title
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a lower bound for the size of the isogeny class of a simple abelian variety over a finite field with commutative endomorphism ring in the Lubin-Tate case. Moreover, based on the expected size of the isogeny classes in the Newton stratum, we conjecture that this lower bound is sharp.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a Lefschetz trace formula for B\"ockle-Pink crystals on tame Deligne-Mumford stacks of finite type over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and apply it to the crystal associated to the universal Drinfeld module. Combined with the Eichler-Shimura theory developed by B\"ockle, this leads to a trace formula for Hecke operators on Drinfeld modular forms. As an application, we deduce a Ramanujan bound on the traces of Hecke operators.</p></details>
| 2025-07-17 | **Effective atypical intersections and applications to orbit closures** | Gregorio Baldi, David Urbanik | math.AG | <a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16628v2'>2406.16628</a> |
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a unifying setting for dealing with monodromically atypical intersections that goes beyond the usual Zilber-Pink conjecture. In particular we obtain a new proof of finiteness of the maximal atypical orbit closures in each stratum of translation surfaces $\Omega \mathcal{M}_g (\kappa)$, as given by Eskin, Filip, and Wright. We also describe a concrete algorithm, implementable in principle on a computer, which provably computes all maximal orbit closures which are 'atypical' in a sense described by Filip. The same methods also give a general algorithm for computing atypical special loci associated to systems of differential equations, and in particular give an effective and o-minimal free proof of the geometric Zilber-Pink conjecture for variations of mixed Hodge structures.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 24 pages. Comments are welcome
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the configuration space of orbits, a generalization of the configuration space of points but for algebraic varieties that are acted by an algebraic reductive group. The main objective of this work is to study the $E$-polynomials of these spaces and their quotients by $S_n$. For this purpose, we develop a novel method for computing the $S_n$-equivariant $E$-polynomial of an algebraic variety, and we apply it to this kind of varieties.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 36 pp., to appear in Forum of Mathematics Sigma
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider Shimura varieties associated to a unitary group of signature $(n-s,s)$ where $n$ is even. For these varieties, we construct smooth $p$-adic integral models for $s=1$ and regular $p$-adic integral models for $s=2$ and $s=3$ over odd primes $p$ which ramify in the imaginary quadratic field with level subgroup at $p$ given by the stabilizer of a $\pi$-modular lattice in the hermitian space. Our construction, which has an explicit moduli-theoretic description, is given by an explicit resolution of a corresponding local model.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 19 pages
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we prove that, when an abelian scheme has semi-abelian degeneration along normal crossings divisor in a regular base scheme, a finite flat group scheme of torsion points of the abelian scheme degenerates to a log finite group scheme, which captures more information than a quasi-finite flat group scheme of torsion points of the semi-abelian scheme.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 51 pages, comments are welcome
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present new techniques for removing arrows of bound quiver algebras, reducing thus the Finitistic Dimension Conjecture $\mathsf{(FDC)}$ for a given algebra to a smaller one. Unlike the classic arrow removal operation of Green-Psaroudakis-Solberg, our methods allow for removing arrows even when they occur in every generating set for the defining admissible ideal of the algebra. Our first main result establishes an equivalence for the finiteness of the finitistic (and global) dimensions of a ring $\Lambda$ and its quotient $\Lambda/K$, under specific homological and structural conditions on the ideal $K$, in the broader context of left artinian rings. The application of this result to bound quiver algebras suggests the notion of removability for sets of arrows, and we prove that successive arrow removals of this sort lead to a uniquely defined arrow reduced version of the algebra. Towards the opposite direction, we characterize generalized arrow removal algebras via removable multiplicative bimodules, and introduce trivial one-arrow extensions as a novel combinatorial construction for adding arrows while preserving the finiteness of the finitistic (and global) dimensions. All these new techniques are illustrated through various concrete bound quiver algebras, for which confirming the $\mathsf{(FDC)}$ had previously seemed intractable to the best of our knowledge.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any finite cyclic $p$-group $G$, we will show that every $\mathbb{Z}_p$-torsion free finitely generated $\mathbb{Z}_p[G]$-module appears as $\mathcal{O}_K^\times\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}\mathbb{Z}_p$ up to $\mathbb{Z}_p[G]$-free direct summands for a certain $G$-extension $K/k$ of number fields.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 16 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1706.09246
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The greatest integer that does not belong to a numerical semigroup $S$ is called the Frobenius number of $S$, and finding the Frobenius number is called the Frobenius problem. In this paper, we solve the Frobenius problem for the numerical semigroups generated by binomial coefficients. As applications, we provide some nontrivial identities among binomial coefficients, and we also connect the main results to the theory of $(s,s+1,s+p)$-core partitions of integers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 49 pages. Comments and improvements welcome!
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G \leq \operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ be a non-trivial finite group, acting on $R = \mathbb{C}[x_1, x_2, x_3]$. We continue our investigation from arXiv:2505.10683 [math.RT] into when the resulting skew-group algebra $R \ast G$ is a $3$-preprojective algebra of a $2$-representation infinite algebra. We consider the subgroups arising from $\operatorname{GL}_2(\mathbb{C}) \hookrightarrow \operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$, called type (B), as well as the exceptional subgroups, called types (E) -- (L). For groups of type (B), we show that a $3$-preprojective structure exists on $R \ast G$ if and only if $G$ is not isomorphic to a subgroup of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ or $\operatorname{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$. For groups $G$ of the remaining types (E) -- (L), every $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective structure, except for type (H) and (I). To prove our results for type (B), we explore how the notion of isoclinism interacts with the shape of McKay quivers. We compute the McKay quivers in detail, using a knitting-style heuristic. For the exceptional subgroups, we compute the McKay quivers directly, as well as cuts, and we discuss how this task can be done algorithmically. This provides many new examples of $2$-representation infinite algebras, and together with arXiv:2401.10720 [math.RT], arXiv:2505.10683 [math.RT] completes the classification of finite subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ for which $R \ast G$ is a $3$-preprojective algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate cases where Thabit and Williams numbers in base $b$ can be expressed as the sum or difference of two $g$-repdigits. For specific values of $b$ and $g$, we describe parametric solutions yielding infinitely many solutions for some equations and establish upper bounds for the parameters of the remaining finitely many solutions. As an illustration, we also provide a complete solution for some equations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The loop Hecke algebra is a generalization of the Hecke algebra to the loop braid group, introduced by Damiani, Martin and Rowell. We give a new presentation of the loop Hecke algebra provided a mild condition on the parameter and give a basis. We use higher linear rewriting theory to show linear independence and the combinatorics of Dyck paths to compute the cardinality of the basis. This yields a conjecture of Damiani-Martin-Rowel. We also give a representation theoretic interpretation of the loop Hecke algebra in terms of (non-semisimple) Schur-Weyl duality involving the negative half of quantum $\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 33 pages
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We continue the study of cactus flower moduli spaces $\overline{F}_n$ and Gaudin models started in arXiv:2308.06880, arXiv:2407.06424. We show that isomorphism classes of operadic coverings of the real form $\overline{F}_n(\mathbb{R})$ are naturally one-to-one with equivalence classes of concrete coboundary monoidal categories (i.e. coboundary monoidal categories that admit a faithful monoidal functor to sets) with certain semisimplicity and finiteness conditions. Following the strategy of arXiv:1708.05105, for any complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, we recover Kashiwara $\mathfrak{g}$-crystals, as a concrete coboundary category, from the coverings given by Bethe eigenlines for inhomogeneous Gaudin models. Using this, we compute the monodromy of Bethe eigenlines for trigonometric Gaudin models over two different real loci. In the particular case of minuscule highest weights, this can be regarded as combinatorial version of the wall-crossing conjecture of Bezrukavnikov and Okounkov for quantum cohomology of symplectic resolutions in the case of minuscule resolutions of slices in the affine Grassmannian.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\chi$ be a Dirichlet character mod $D$ with $L(s,\chi)$ its associated $L$-function, and let $\psi(x,q,a)$ be Chebyshev's prime-counting function for primes congruent to $a$ modulo $q$. We show that under the assumption of an exceptional character $\chi$ with $L(1,\chi)=o\left((\log D)^{-5}\right)$, for any $q<x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$, the asymptotic $$\psi(x,q,a)=\frac{\psi(x)}{\phi(q)}\left(1-\chi\left(\frac{aD}{(D,q)}\right)+o(1)\right)$$ holds for almost all $a$ with $(a,q)=1$. We also find that for any fixed $a$, the above holds for almost all $q<x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$ with $(a,q)=1$. Previous prime equidistribution results under the assumption of Siegel zeroes (by Friedlander-Iwaniec and the current author) have found that the above asymptotic holds either for all $a$ and $q$ or on average over a range of $q$ (i.e. for the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture), but only under the assumption that $q<x^{\theta}$ where $\theta=\frac{30}{59}$ or $\frac{16}{31}$, respectively.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a framework for producing interesting subcategories of the category ${}_A\mathsf{Mod}$ of left $A$-modules, where $A$ is an associative algebra over a field $k$. The construction is based on the composition, $Y$, of the Yoneda embedding of ${}_A\mathsf{Mod}$ with a restriction to certain subcategories $\mathcal{B}\subset {}_A\mathsf{Mod}$, typically consisting of cyclic modules. We describe the subcategories on which $Y$ provides an equivalence of categories. This also provides a way to understand the subcategories of ${}_A\mathsf{Mod}$ that arise this way. Many well-known categories are obtained in this way, including categories of weight modules and Harish-Chandra modules with respect to a subalgebra $\Gamma$ of $A$. In other special cases the equivalence involves modules over the Mickelsson step algebra associated to a reductive pair of Lie algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak h$ be a Cartan subalgebra of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g.$ We define a compactification $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ of $\mathfrak h$, which is analogous to the closure $\bar H$ of the corresponding maximal torus $H$ in the adjoint group of $\mathfrak g$ in its wonderful compactification, which was introduced and studied by De Concini and Procesi \cite{DCP}. We observe that $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ is a matroid Schubert variety and prove that the irreducible components of the boundary $\bar {\mathfrak h} - \mathfrak h$ of $\mathfrak h$ are divisors indexed by root system data. We prove that $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ is a normal variety and find an affine paving of $\bar {\mathfrak h},$ where the strata are given by the orbits of $\mathfrak h.$ We show that the strata of $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ correspond bijectively to subspaces of the corresponding Coxeter hyperplane arrangement studied by Orlik and Solomon, and prove that the associated posets are isomorphic. As a consequence, we express the Betti numbers of $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ in terms of well-known combinatorial invariants in the classical cases. We show that the Weyl group $W$ acts on $\bar {\mathfrak h}$, and describe $H^{\bullet}(\bar {\mathfrak h}, \mathbb C)$ as a representation of $W$, and compute the cup product for $H^{\bullet}(\bar {\mathfrak h}, \mathbb Z)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider Euclidean lattices spanned by images of algebraic conjugates of an algebraic number under Minkowski embedding, investigating their rank, properties of their automorphism groups and sets of minimal vectors. We are especially interested in situations when the resulting lattice is well-rounded. We show that this happens for large Pisot numbers of prime degree, demonstrating infinite families of such lattices. We also fully classify well-rounded lattices from algebraic conjugates in the 2-dimensional case and present various examples in the 3-dimensional case. Finally, we derive a determinant formula for the resulting lattice in the case when the minimal polynomial of an algebraic number has its Galois group of a particular type.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The $\star_M$-family of tensor-tensor products is a framework which generalizes many properties from linear algebra to third order tensors. Here, we investigate positive semidefiniteness and semidefinite programming under the $\star_M$-product. Critical to our investigation is a connection between the choice of matrix M in the $\star_M$-product and the representation theory of an underlying group action. Using this framework, third order tensors equipped with the $\star_M$-product are a natural setting for the study of invariant semidefinite programs. As applications of the M-SDP framework, we provide a characterization of certain nonnegative quadratic forms and solve low-rank tensor completion problems.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For every positive integer $m$ LeVeque (1953) defined the $U_m$-numbers as the transcendental numbers that admit very good approximation by algebraic numbers of degree $m$, but not by those of smaller degree. In these terms, Mahler's $U$-numbers are the transcendental numbers which are $U_m$ for some $m$. In 1965 Mahler showed that (properly defined) lacunary power series with integers coefficients take $U$-values at algebraic numbers, unless the value is algebraic for an obvious reason. However, his argument does not specify to which $U_m$ the value belongs. In this article, we introduce the notion of generalized Liouville series, and give a necessary and sufficient condition for their values to be $U_m$. As an application, we show that a generalized Liouville series takes a $U_m$-value at a simple algebraic integer of degree $m$, unless the value is algebraic for an obvious reason. (An algebraic number $\alpha$ is called simple if the number field $\mathbb Q(\alpha)$ does not have a proper subfield other than $\mathbb Q$.)</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The space of unit flows on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is known to admit regular unimodular triangulations induced by framings of the DAG. Amply framed DAGs and their triangulated flow polytopes have recently been connected with the representation theory of certain gentle algebras. We expand on this connection by defining a flow on the fringed quiver of an arbitrary gentle algebra. We call the space of unit flows its turbulence polyhedron. We show that support tau-tilting modules of a gentle algebra index a unimodular triangulation of its turbulence polyhedron. In the representation-infinite case, this triangulation is not complete and we give two different larger polyhedral dissections given by adding lower-dimensional walls to the picture. The turbulence polyhedron has a quotient map to what we define as the g-polyhedron lying in the ambient space of the g-vector fan, proving that gentle algebras are g-convex. Moreover, the images of our two types of walls under this quotient map provide two different interpretations for the complement of the g-vector fan of a gentle algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>One of the ultimate goals of the Hassett-Keel program is the determination of the log canonical models of the moduli spaces of pointed rational curves $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}$. In this paper, we study log canonical models of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,5}$ with \textit{asymmetric} boundary divisors. Our results generalize previous work by Alexeev-Swinarski, Fedorchuk-Smyth, Kiem-Moon and Simpson for the case $n=5$. We prove that all moduli spaces of weighted pointed rational curves $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,\mathcal{A}}$ arise as log canonical models of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,5}$ for suitable choices of boundary coefficients, thereby also recovering a theorem of Fedorchuk and Moon. In addition, we relate these moduli spaces to Deligne-Mostow ball quotients. We further study log canonical models of the moduli spaces $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n\cdot (1/k)}$ with symmetric weight, which differ from $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a more general version of the gluings of hyperbolic orbifolds in the spirit of Gromov and Piatetski-Shapiro, where the gluing pieces, called the building blocks, are no longer assumed to be arithmetic or incommensurable. We prove that if such a general hyperbolic gluing along a common finite-volume totally geodesic hypersurface is quasi-arithmetic (this is a broader notion than that of arithmeticity) then each building block must be quasi-arithmetic as well and, moreover, with the same ambient group and adjoint trace field. We also show that there exist arithmetic gluings whose building blocks are incommensurable even despite the reflection with respect to the lift of the gluing locus commensurates the fundamental group of the gluing. On the other hand, we provide an example of nonarithmetic but quasi-arithmetic orbifolds such that a specific gluing of such an orbifold with itself along the boundary gives rise to an arithmetic hyperbolic orbifold. We illustrate the above results in the setting of reflection groups and hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedra and apply them to rule out the (quasi-)arithmeticity of a family of ideal hyperbolic right-angled $3$-polyhedra, namely, certain ``twisted'' ideal right-angled antiprisms, which play an important role in low-dimensional geometry and topology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose an algebro-geometric interpretation of the Schur and Macdonald indices of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs). We conjecture that there exists an affine scheme $X$ such that the Hilbert series of the (appropriately-graded) arc space of its polynomial ring $J_\infty(\mathbb{C}[X])$ encodes the indices. Distinct local descriptions of a (singular) point correspond to distinct choices of $X$, giving rise to a family of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs each without a Higgs branch. These local descriptions directly translate into nilpotency relations in the operator product expansions. We test our conjecture across a variety of (generalized) Argyres-Douglas (AD) theories.</p></details>

A longstanding folklore conjecture asserts that the only solutions are the ``trivial'' ones with $y=-1$. We confirm the conjecture unconditionally for $p\leq 13$, and prove the conjecture holds for $p>1831$ through a careful application of lower bounds for linear forms in two logarithms. We also show that any ``nontrivial'' solution must satisfy $y > 10^{1000}$. In addition, we establish auxiliary results that may support future progress on the problem, and we revisit prior claims in the literature regarding unresolved cases of the equation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we investigate factorization problems for twisted triple product Galois representations over real quadratic fields, arising from families of Hilbert cusp forms. Specifically, we address the factorization in two distinct settings determined by the order of vanishing of associated $L$-unctions at their central critical values-namely, the rank (1,1) and rank (0,2) cases. Our results generalize the algebraic factorization framework developed by B\"{u}y\"{u}kboduk et al. in higher rank scenario to the setting of real quadratic fields. Notably, our work yields the first known factorization result in the higher rank (0,2) case, marking a significant advancement in the study of triple product motives over totally real fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Ramanujan derived a sequence of even weight $2n$ quasimodular forms $U_{2n}(q)$ from derivatives of Jacobi's weight $3/2$ theta function. Using the generating function for this sequence, one can construct sequences of quasimodular forms of all nonnegative integer weights with minimal input: a weight 1 modular form and a power series $F(X)$. Using the weight 1 form $\theta(q)^2$ and $F(X)=e^{X/2}$, we obtain a sequence $\{Y_n(q)\}$ of weight $n$ quasimodular forms on $\Gamma_0(4)$ whose symmetric function avatars $\widetilde{Y}_n(\pmb{x}^k)$ are the symmetric polynomials $T_n(\pmb{x}^k)$ that arise naturally in the study of syzygies of numerical semigroups. With this information, we settle two conjectures about the $T_n(\pmb{x}^k).$ Finally, we note that these polynomials are systematically given in terms of the Borel-Hirzebruch $\widehat{A}$-genus for spin manifolds, where one identifies power sum symmetric functions $p_i$ with Pontryagin classes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a diagrammatic approach to the representation theory of the quantum symmetric pairs corresponding to orthosymplectic Lie superalgebras inside general linear Lie superalgebras. Our approach is based on the disoriented skein category, which we define as a module category over the framed HOMFLYPT skein category. The disoriented skein category admits full incarnation functors to the categories of modules over the iquantum enveloping algebras corresponding to the quantum symmetric pairs, and it can be viewed as an interpolating category for these categories of modules. We define an equivalence of module categories between the disoriented skein category and the iquantum Brauer category (also known as the $q$-Brauer category), after endowing the latter with the structure of a module category over the framed HOMFLYPT skein category. The disoriented skein category has some advantages over the iquantum Brauer category, possessing duality structure and allowing the incarnation functors to be strict morphisms of module categories. Finally, we construct explicit bases for the morphism spaces of the disoriented skein and iquantum Brauer categories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\varphi\colon R \rightarrow A$ be a finite ring homomorphism, where $R$ is a two-sided Noetherian ring, and let $M$ be a finitely generated left $A$-module. Under suitable homological conditions on $A$ over $R$, we establish a close relationship between the classical transpose of $M$ over $A$ and the Gorenstein transpose of a certain syzygy module of $M$ over $R$. As an application, for each integer $k>0$, we provide a sufficient condition under which $M$ is $k$-torsionfree over $A$ if and only if a certain syzygy of $M$ over $R$ is $k$-torsionfree over $R$, extending a result of Zhao. We introduce the notion of quasi-faithfully flat extensions and show that, under suitable assumptions, the extension closedness of the category of $k$-torsionfree modules over $R$ is equivalent to that over $A$. An application is an affirmative answer to a question posed by Zhao concerning quasi $k$-Gorensteiness, in the case where both $R$ and $A$ are Noetherian algebras. Finally, when $\varphi$ is a separable split Frobenius extension, it is proved that the category of $k$-torsionfree $R$-modules has finite representation type if and only if the same holds over $A$, with applications to skew group rings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study tensor categories that interpolate the representation categories of finite classical groups. There are (at least) two ways to approach these categories: via ultraproducts and via oligomorphic groups. Both have strengths and weaknesses. The ultraproduct categories are easy to define, but their structure is not clear. On the other hand, the oligomorphic approach requires a certain kind of measure as an input, and the space of measures is not obvious. Furthermore, it is not a priori clear that the two approaches yield the same categories in general. We handle all of these issues: we determine all measures on the oligomorphic groups, and we show that the oligomorphic and ultraproduct categories agree, which gives us basic structural results about the latter. Our results rely upon (and in some sense repackage) enumerative results in finite geometry.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The transition measure is a foundational concept introduced by Sergey Kerov to represent the shape of a Young diagram as a centered probability measure on the real line. Over a period of decades the transition measure turned out to be an invaluable tool for many problems of the asymptotic representation theory of the symmetric groups. Kerov also showed how to expand this notion for a wider class of continual diagrams so that the transition measure provides a homeomorphism between a subclass of continual diagrams (having a specific support) and a class of centered probability measures with a support contained in a specific interval. We quantify the modulus of continuity of this homeomorphism. More specifically, we study the dependence of the cumulative distribution function of Kerov transition measure on the profile of a diagram at the locations where the profile is not too steep.</p></details>

We focus mainly on actions that are finitely generated, and the key tool in our analysis is a decomposition result for any bounded measurable function into a sum of two components, one that mimics concentration properties of pretentious multiplicative functions and another that mimics vanishing properties of aperiodic multiplicative functions. Crucial to part of our arguments are some new seminorms that are defined by a mixture of addition and multiplication of the iterates of the action, and we prove an inverse theorem that explicitly characterizes the factor of the system on which these seminorms vanish.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ be large. We show that there exist infinitely many primes $q_{1}< \cdot\cdot\cdot < q_{m+1}$ such that $$ q_{m+1}-q_{1}=O(e^{7.63m}) $$ and $q_{j}+2$ has at most $$ \frac{7.36m}{\log 2} + \frac{4\log m}{\log 2} + 21 $$ prime factors for each $1 \leq j \leq m+1$. This improves the previous result of Li and Pan, replacing $m^{4}e^{8m}$ by $e^{7.63m}$ and $\frac{16m}{\log 2} + \frac{5\log m}{\log 2} + 37$ by $\frac{7.36m}{\log 2} + \frac{4\log m}{\log 2} + 21$. The main inputs are the Maynard-Tao sieve, a minorant for the indicator function of the primes constructed by Baker and Irving, for which a stronger equidistribution theorem in arithmetic progressions to smooth moduli is applicable, and Tao's approach previously used to estimate $\sum_{x \leq n < 2x} \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{P}}(n)\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{P}}(n+12)\omega_{n}$, where $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{P}}$ stands for the characteristic function of the primes and $\omega_{n}$ are multidimensional sieve weights.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We derive a family of approximations for L-functions of Hecke cusp eigenforms, according to a recipe first described by Matiyasevich for the Riemann xi function. We show that these approximations converge to the true L-function and point out the role of an equidistributional notion in ensuring the approximation is well-defined, and along the way we demonstrate error formulas which may be used to investigate analytic properties of the L-function and its derivatives, such as the locations and orders of zeros. Together with the Euler product expansion of the L-function, the family of approximations also encodes some of the key features of the L-function such as its functional equation. As an example, we apply this method to the L-function of the modular discriminant and demonstrate that the approximation successfully locates zeros of the L-function on the critical line. Finally, we derive via Mellin transforms a convolution-type formula which leads to precise error bounds in terms of the incomplete gamma function. This formula can be interpreted as an alternative definition for the approximation and sheds light on Matiyasevich's procedure.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $q$ be an odd prime and $k$ be a natural number. We show that a finite subset of integers $S$ that does not contain any perfect $q^{th}$ power, contains a $q^{th}$ power residue modulo almost every natural numbers $N$ with at most $k$ prime factors if and only if $S$ corresponds to a $k$-blocking set of $\PG(\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n})$. Here, $n$ is the number of distinct primes that divides the $q$-free parts of elements of $S$. Consequently, this geometric connection enables us to utilize methods from Galois geometry to derive lower bounds for the cardinalities of such sets $S$ and to completely characterize such $S$ of the smallest and the second smallest cardinalities. Furthermore, the property of whether a finite subset of integers contains a $q^{th}$ power residue modulo almost every integer $N$ with at most $k$ prime factors is invariant under the action of projective general linear group $\mathrm{PGL}(n, q)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The global analogue of a Henselian local ring is a Henselian pair: a ring A and an ideal I which satisfy a condition resembling Hensel's lemma regarding lifting coprime factorizations of polynomials over A/I to factorizations over A. The geometric counterpart is the notion of a Henselian scheme, which is an analogue of a tubular neighborhood in algebraic geometry. In this paper we revisit the foundations of the theory of Henselian schemes. The pathological behavior of quasi-coherent sheaves on Henselian schemes in characteristic 0 makes them poor models for an "algebraic tube" in characteristic 0. We show that such problems do not arise in positive characteristic, and establish good properties for analogues of smooth and \'etale maps in the general Henselian setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The arithmetic average of the first $n$ primes, $\bar p_n = {1\over n} \sum_{i=1}^n p_i$, exhibits very many interesting and subtle properties. Since the transformation from $p_n \to \bar p_n$ is extremely easy to invert, $p_n = n\bar p_n - (n-1)\bar p_{n-1}$, it is clear that these two sequences $p_n \longleftrightarrow \bar p_n$ must ultimately carry exactly the same information. But the averaged sequence $\bar p_n$, while very closely correlated with the primes, ($\bar p_n \sim {1\over2} p_n$), is much "smoother'', and much better behaved. Using extensions of various standard results I shall demonstrate that the prime-averaged sequence $\bar p_n$ satisfies prime-averaged analogues of the Cramer, Andrica, Legendre, Oppermann, Brocard, Fourges, Firoozbakht, Nicholson, and Farhadian conjectures. (So these prime-averaged analogues are not conjectures, they are theorems.) The crucial key to enabling this pleasant behaviour is the "smoothing'' process inherent in averaging. Whereas the asymptotic behaviour of the two sequences is very closely correlated the local fluctuations are quite different.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\ell\in\{0,1,\dots,n\}$, we consider the function extracting the $\ell$th coefficient of the Ehrhart polynomials of lattice polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^n$. These functions form a basis of the space of unimodular invariant valuations. We show that, in even dimensions, these functions are in fact simultaneous symplectic Hecke eigenfunctions. We leverage this and apply the theory of spherical functions and their associated zeta functions to prove analytic, asymptotic, and combinatorial results about the arithmetic functions averaging $\ell$th Ehrhart coefficients.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Comments are welcome
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(F_r M)_{r\in\mathbb{Z}}$ be a finite filtration on an object $M$ of a neutral Tannakian category $\mathbf{T}$ in characteristic zero. Let $u(M)=u^F(M)$ be the Lie algebra of the subgroup of the Tannakian fundamental group of $M$ that acts trivially on the associated graded $Gr^FM$. The filtration $F_\bullet M$ induces a filtration on the internal Hom $\underline{Hom}(M,M)$, which in turn induces a filtration $F_\bullet u(M)$ on $u(M)$. This filtration on $u(M)$ is concentrated in negative degrees. In this paper, we give a description of the graded piece $Gr^F_{-1}u( M)$ in terms of the extensions $F_{r+1}M/F_{r-1}M\in Ext^1(Gr^F_{r+1}M, Gr^F_{r}M)$. In particular, these extensions determine $Gr^F_{-1}u(M)$. Note that here we neither assume the filtration is functorial, nor we assume that $Gr^FM$ is semisimple. The problem of studying $u(M)$ in this generality is motivated by the desire to understand Tannakian groups associated to a mixed motive and its realizations, including realizations for which semisimplicity of realizations of pure motives is not known and realizations that lack an interesting functorial weight filtration. We also give two related applications. The first is an equivalent condition in the generality described above for when $u(M)$ coincides with its trivial upper bound $F_{-1}\underline{Hom}(M,M)$. This result generalizes earlier criteria for maximality of $u(M)$ obtained by various authors in special contexts or under limiting conditions. In the second application, we apply the results to the setting of a neutral Tannakian category with a functorial weight filtration $W_\bullet$. Combining the constructions of [arXiv:2307.15487] with our general maximality criterion we prove a result about the structure of the set of isomorphism classes of objects $M$ for which $Gr^WM$ is isomorphic to a given graded object $A$ and $u^W(M)=W_{-1}\underline{Hom}(M,M)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a nonempty set $A \subset \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$, define the mask polynomial $A(X)=\sum_{a\in A} X^a$. Suppose that there are $s_1,\dots,s_k\in\nn\setminus\{1\}$ such that the cyclotomic polynomials $\Phi_{s_1},\dots,\Phi_{s_k}$ divide $A(X)$. What is the smallest possible size of $A$? For $k=1$, this was answered by Lam and Leung in 2000. Less is known about the case when $k\geq 2$; in particular, one may ask whether (similarly to the $k=1$ case) the optimal configurations have a simple ``fibered" structure on each scale involved. We prove that this is true in a number of special cases, but false in general, even if further strong structural assumptions are added. Results of this type are expected to have a broad range of applications, including Favard length of product Cantor sets, Fuglede's spectral set conjecture, and the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture on integer tilings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we are concerned with a family of sums involving the floor function. With $r$ a non negative integer and $n$ and $m$ positive integers we consider the sums \begin{equation*}\mathbf{S}_{r}\left(n,m\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}{\left\lfloor \frac{km}{n}\right\rfloor}^r\end{equation*} While a formula for $\mathbf{S}_1$ is well known, we provide closed-form formulas for $\mathbf{S}_2$ and $\mathbf{S}_3$ as well as the reciprocity laws they satisfy. Additionally, one can find a closed-form formula for the classical Dedekind sum using the Euclidean algorithm. Finally, we provide a general formula for $\mathbf{S}_r$ showing its dependency on generalized Dedekind sums.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero over which every diagonal form in sufficiently many variables admits a nontrivial solution. For example, $K$ may be a totally imaginary number field or a finite extension of a $p$-adic field. Suppose $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ are forms of degree $d$ over $K.$ Bik, Draisma and Snowden recently proved that there exists a constant $B = B(d,s,K)$ such that the rational solutions to the system of equations $f_1=\ldots=f_s = 0$ are Zariski dense, as long as the Birch rank of $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ is greater than $B.$ We establish an effective bound for this constant. Combined with results of Skinner, we obtain as a corollary a sufficient condition for the integer zeros of a system of forms over a number field to satisfy the Hardy-Littlewood asymptotic with a positive leading term. This corollary generalizes a seminal result proved by Schmidt for the rational numbers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Lots of minor corrections made; exposition improved. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1907.03686
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study $t$-structures (on triangulated categories) that are closely related to weight structures. A $t$-structure couple $t=(C_{t\le 0},C_{t\ge 0})$ is said to be adjacent to a weight structure $w=(C_{w\le 0}, C_{w\ge 0})$ if $C_{t\ge 0}=C_{w\ge 0}$. For a category $C$ that satisfies the Brown representability property we prove that $t$ that is adjacent to $w$ exists if and only if $w$ is smashing (that is, "respects C-coproducts"). The heart $Ht$ of this $t$ is the category of those functors $Hw^{op}\to Ab$ that respect products (here $Hw$ is the heart of $w$); the result has important applications. We prove several more statements on constructing $t$-structures starting from weight structures; we look for a strictly orthogonal $t$-structure $t$ on some $C'$ (where $C,C'$ are triangulated subcategories of a common $D$) such that $C'_{t\le 0}$ (resp. $C'_{t\ge 0}$) is characterized by the vanishing of morphisms from $C_{w\ge 1}$ (resp. $C_{w\le -1}$). Some of these results generalize properties of semi-orthogonal decompositions proved in the previous paper, and can be applied to various derived categories of (quasi)coherent sheaves on a scheme $X$ that is projective over an affine noetherian one. We also study hearts of orthogonal $t$-structures and their restrictions, and prove some statements on "reconstructing" weight structures from orthogonal $t$-structures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is the second in a series devoted to describing the integral Chow ring of the moduli stacks $\mathcal{RH}_g$ of hyperelliptic Prym pairs. For fixed genus $g$, the stack $\mathcal{RH}_g$ is the disjoint union of $\lfloor (g+1)/2 \rfloor$ components $\mathcal{RH}_g^n$ for $n = 1, \ldots, \lfloor (g+1)/2 \rfloor$. In this paper, we compute the integral Chow rings of the components $\mathcal{RH}_g^{(g+1)/2}$ for odd $g$. Along the way, we also determine the integral Chow ring of the moduli stack of unordered pairs of two divisors in $\mathbb{P}^1$ of the same even degree.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Grothendieck-Serre conjecture predicts that every generically trivial torsor under a reductive group $G$ over a regular semilocal ring $R$ is trivial. We establish this for unramified $R$ granted that $G^{\mathrm{ad}}$ is totally isotropic, that is, has a "maximally transversal" parabolic $R$-subgroup. We also use purity for the Brauer group to reduce the conjecture for unramified $R$ to simply connected $G$--a much less direct such reduction of Panin had been a step in solving the equal characteristic case of Grothendieck-Serre. We base the group-theoretic aspects of our arguments on the geometry of the stack $\mathrm{Bun}_G$, instead of the affine Grassmannian used previously, and we quickly reprove the crucial weak $\mathbb{P}^1$-invariance input: for any reductive group $H$ over a semilocal ring $A$, every $H$-torsor $\mathscr{E}$ on $\mathbb{P}^1_A$ satisfies $\mathscr{E}|_{\{t = 0\}} \simeq \mathscr{E}|_{\{t = \infty\}}$. For the geometric aspects, we develop reembedding and excision techniques for relative curves with finiteness weakened to quasi-finiteness, thus overcoming a known obstacle in mixed characteristic, and show that every generically trivial torsor over $R$ under a totally isotropic $G$ trivializes over every affine open of $\mathrm{Spec}(R) \setminus Z$ for some closed $Z$ of codimension $\ge 2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is an introduction to quantum algebra, from a geometric perspective. The classical spaces $X$, such as the Lie groups, homogeneous spaces, or more general manifolds, are described by various algebras $A$, defined over various fields $F$. These algebras $A$ satisfy a commutativity type condition, and the general idea is that of lifting this condition, and calling quantum spaces the underlying space-like objects $X$. One problem comes from the fact that different fields $F$ lead, via different algebras $A$, to different classes of quantum spaces $X$. Our aim here is to identify and put at the center of the presentation those quantum spaces $X$ which do not depend on the choice of $F$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent paper, Bary-Soroker, Koukoulopoulos and Kozma proved that when $A$ is a random monic polynomial of $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ of deterministic degree $n$ with coefficients $a_j$ drawn independently according to measures $\mu_j,$ then $A$ is irreducible with probability tending to $1$ as $n\to\infty$ under a condition of near-uniformity of the $\mu_j$ modulo four primes (which notably happens when the $\mu_j$ are uniform over a segment of $\mathbb Z$ of length $N\ge 35.$) We improve here the speed of convergence when we have the near-uniformity condition modulo more primes. Notably, we obtain the optimal bound $\mathbb{P}(A \text{ irreducible}) = 1 -O(1/\sqrt n)$ when we have near-uniformity modulo twelve primes, which notably happens when the $\mu_j$ are uniform over a segment of length $N\ge 10^8.$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given an amenable second countable Hausdorff locally compact \'etale groupoid $\mathcal G$ such that each isotropy group $\mathcal G^x_x$ has local polynomial growth, we give a description of $\operatorname{Prim} C^*(\mathcal G)$ as a topological space in terms of the topology on $\mathcal G$ and representation theory of the isotropy groups and their subgroups. The description simplifies when either the isotropy groups are FC-hypercentral or $\mathcal G$ is the transformation groupoid $\Gamma\ltimes X$ defined by an action $\Gamma\curvearrowright X$ with locally finite stabilizers. To illustrate the class of C$^*$-algebras for which our results can provide a complete description of the ideal structure, we compute the primitive spectrum of $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb Z)\ltimes C_0(\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb R)/U_3(\mathbb R))$, where $U_3(\mathbb R)$ is the group of unipotent upper triangular matrices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Integral linear systems $Ax=b$ with matrices $A$, $b$ and solutions $x$ are also required to be in integers, can be solved using invariant factors of $A$ (by computing the Smith Canonical Form of $A$). This paper explores a new problem which arises in applications, that of obtaining conditions for solving the Modular Linear System $Ax=b\rem n$ given $A,b$ in $\zz_n$ for $x$ in $\zz_n$ along with the constraint that the value of the linear function $\phi(x)=\la w,x\ra$ is coprime to $n$ for some solution $x$. In this paper we develop decomposition of the system to coprime moduli $p^{r(p)}$ which are divisors of $n$ and show how such a decomposition simplifies the computation of Smith form. This extends the well known index calculus method of computing the discrete logarithm where the moduli over which the linear system is reduced were assumed to be prime (to solve the reduced systems over prime fields) to the case when the factors of the modulus are prime powers $p^{r(p)}$. It is shown how this problem can be addressed effciently using the invariant factors and Smith form of the augmented matrix $[A,-p^{r(p)}I]$ and conditions modulo $p$ satisfied by $w$, where $p^{r(p)}$ vary over all divisors of $n$ with $p$ prime.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by the convolutive behavior of the counting function for partitions with designated summands in which all parts are odd, we consider coefficient sequences $(a_n)_{n\ge 0}$ of primitive eta-products that satisfy the generic convolutive property \begin{align*} \sum_{n\ge 0} a_{mn} q^n = \left(\sum_{n\ge 0} a_n q^n\right)^m \end{align*} for a specific positive integer $m$. Given the results of an exhaustive search of the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences for such sequences for $m$ up to $6$, we first focus on the case where $m=2$ with our attention mainly paid to the combinatorics of two $2$-convolutive sequences, featuring bijective proofs for both. For other $2$-convolutive sequences discovered in the OEIS, we apply generating function manipulations to show their convolutivity. We also give two examples of $3$-convolutive sequences. Finally, we discuss other convolutive series that are not eta-products.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A matching from a finite subset $A$ of an abelian group $G$ to another subset $B$ is a bijection $f : A \to B$ such that $a f(a) \notin A$ for all $a \in A$. The study of matchings began in the 1990s and was motivated by a conjecture of E. K. Wakeford on canonical forms for homogeneous polynomials. The theory was later extended to the linear-algebraic setting of vector subspaces over field extensions, and then to matroids. In this paper, we investigate the existence and structure of matchings in both abelian groups and field extensions. Using Dyson's $e$-transform, a tool from additive combinatorics, along with a linear analogue which is introduced in this paper, we establish characterization theorems for matchable sets and subspaces. Several applications are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of these theorems as standalone tools. Throughout, we highlight the parallels between the group-theoretic and linear-algebraic perspectives.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ and $B$ be two tensor rings given by weight quivers. We introduce norms for tensor rings and $(A,B)$-bimodules, and define an important category $\mathscr{A}^p_{\varsigma}$ in this paper whose object is a triple $(N,v,\delta)$ given by an $(A,B)$-bimodule $N$, a special element $v\in V$ satisfying some special conditions, and a special $(A,B)$-homomorphism $\delta: N^{\oplus_p 2^{\dim A}} \to N$ and each morphism $(N,v,\delta) \to (N',v',\delta')$ is given by an $(A,B)$-homomorphism $\theta: N\to N'$ such that $\theta(v)=v'$ and $\delta' \theta^{\oplus 2^{\dim A}} = \theta\delta$ hold. We show that $\mathscr{A}^p_{\varsigma}$ has an initial object such that Daniell integration, Bochner integration, Lebesgue integration, Stone--Weierstrass Approximation Theorem, power series expansion, and Fourier series expansion are morphisms in $\mathscr{A}^p_{\varsigma}$ starting with this initial object.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any point $\mathrm{X}$ in the cluster complex $\mathrm{Cpx}(\mathcal{C})$ of a 2-Calabi-Yau category $\mathcal{C}$, we introduce $\mathrm{X}$-evolution flow on $\mathrm{Cpx}(\mathcal{C})$. We show that such a flow induces a piecewise linear one-dimensional $\mathrm{X}$-foliation with two singularities, the unique sink $\mathrm{X}$ and the unique source $\mathrm{X}[1]$. Moreover, we show that evolution flows on cluster complexes are continuous refinement/generalization of green mutations on cluster exchange graphs. For the cluster category of a Dynkin or Euclidean quiver $Q$, we prove that the $\mathrm{X}$-foliation is compact or semi-compact, for various choices of $\mathrm{X}$. As an application, we show that $\mathrm{Cpx}(\mathcal{C})$ is spherical (Dynkin case) or contractible (Euclidean case). As a byproduct, we show that the fundamental group of the cluster exchange graph of $Q$ is generated by squares and pentagons.</p></details>

In this paper, we interpret part of the definition of Cappell-Shaneson polynomial as algebraic conditions on polynomials in terms of signed reciprocal polynomial and reduction modulo primes, and give complete lists of all Cappell-Shaneson polynomials of degrees $4$ and $5$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a finite group, let $x\in G$ and let $p$ be a prime. We prove that the commutator $[x,g]$ is a $p$-element for every $g\in G$ if and only if $x$ is central modulo $O_p(G),$ where $O_p(G)$ denotes the largest normal $p$-subgroup of $G$. This result simultaneously generalizes some variants of both the Baer-Suzuki theorem and Glauberman's $Z_p^*$-theorem. Furthermore, we show that if $x\in G$ is a $p$-element and there exists an integer $m\ge 1$ such that for all $g\in G$, either $[x,g]=1$ or the order of $[x,g] $ is $m$ for every $g\in G$, then the subgroup generated by the conjugacy class of $G$ containing $x$ is solvable. As an application, we confirm a conjecture of Beltr\'an, Felipe and Melchor, which states that if $K$ is a conjugacy class of $G$ such that the product $K^{-1}K=1\cup D\cup D^{-1}$ for some conjugacy class $D$ of $G$, then the subgroup generated by $K$ is solvable.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We formulate a precise connection between the new Drinfeld presentation of a quantum affine algebra $U_q\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$ and the new Drinfeld presentation of affine coideal subalgebras of split type recently discovered by Lu and Wang. In particular, we establish a ``factorization formula'', expressing the commuting ``Drinfeld-Cartan''-type operators $\Theta_{i,k}$ in a coideal subalgebra in terms of the corresponding Drinfeld generators of $U_q\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$, modulo the ``Drinfeld positive half" of $U_q\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$. We study the spectra of these operators on finite dimensional representations, and describe them in terms of rational functions with an extra symmetry. These results can be seen as the starting point of a $q$-character theory for affine Kac--Moody quantum symmetric pairs. Additionally, we prove a compatibility result linking Lusztig's and the Lu-Wang-Zhang braid group actions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define Poisson genericity for infinite sequences in any finite or countable alphabet with an invariant exponentially-mixing probability measure. A sequence is Poisson generic if the number of occurrences of blocks of symbols asymptotically follows a Poisson law as the block length increases. We prove that almost all sequences are Poisson generic. Our result generalizes Peres and Weiss' theorem about Poisson genericity of integral bases numeration systems. In particular, we obtain that their continued fraction expansions for almost all real numbers are Poisson generic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We classify the irredible representations of $\mathrm{GL}_{2}(q)$ for which the induction to the product group $\mathrm{GL}_{2}(q)\times\mathrm{GL}_{2}(q)$, under the diagonal embedding, decomposes multiplicity free. It turns out that only the irreducible representations of dimensions $1$ and $q-1$ have this property. We show that for $\mathrm{GL}_{2}(q)$ embedded into $\mathrm{SL}_{3}(q)$ via $g\mapsto\mathrm{diag}(g,\det g^{-1})$ none of the irreducible representations of $\mathrm{GL}_{2}(q)$ induce multiplicity free. In contrast, over the complex numbers, the holomorphic representation theory of these pairs is multiplicity free and the corresponding matrix coefficients are encoded by vector-valued Jacobi polynomials. We show that similar results cannot be expected in the context of finite fields for these examples.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $q$ be a prime power and $\mathbb{F}_q$ the finite field with $q$ elements. For a positive integer $n$, the polynomial $X^n - 1 \in \mathbb{F}_q[X]$ is termed $3$-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$ if all its irreducible factors in $\mathbb{F}_q[X]$ are either binomials or trinomials. In 2021, Oliveira and Reis characterized all positive integers $n$ for which $X^n - 1$ is 3-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$ when $q = 2$ and $q = 4$. Recently, the author provided a complete characterization for odd $q$. This paper extends the investigation to finite fields of even characteristic, fully determining all $n$ such that $X^n - 1$ is 3-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$ for even $q$. This work resolves two open problems posed by Oliveira and Reis for even characteristic case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A quasi-exponential is an entire function of the form $e^{cu}p(u)$, where $p(u)$ is a polynomial and $c \in \mathbb{C}$. Let $V = \langle e^{h_1u}p_1(u), \dots, e^{h_Nu}p_N(u) \rangle$ be a vector space with a basis of quasi-exponentials. We show that if $h_1, \dots, h_N$ are nonnegative and all of the complex zeros of the Wronskian $\operatorname{Wr}(V)$ are real, then $V$ is totally nonnegative in the sense that all of its Grassmann-Pl\"{u}cker coordinates defined by the Taylor expansion about $u=t$ are nonnegative, for any real $t$ greater than all of the zeros of $\operatorname{Wr}(V)$. Our proof proceeds by showing that the higher Gaudin Hamiltonians $T_\lambda^G(t)$ introduced in [ALTZ14] are universal Pl\"ucker coordinates about $u=t$ for the Wronski map on spaces of quasi-exponentials. The result that $V$ is totally nonnegative follows from the fact that $T_\lambda^G(t)$ is positive semidefinite, which we establish using partial traces. We also show that if $h_1 = \cdots = h_N = 0$ then $T_\lambda^G(t)$ equals $\beta^\lambda(t)$, which is the universal Pl\"ucker coordinate for the Wronski map on spaces of polynomials introduced in [KP23].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using basic tools of mathematical analysis and elementary probability theory we address several problems on the irrationality of series of distinct unit fractions, $\sum_k 1/a_k$. In particular, we study subseries of the Lambert series $\sum_k 1/(t^k-1)$ and two types of irrationality sequences $(a_k)$ introduced by Paul Erd\H{o}s and Ronald Graham. Next, we address a question of Erd\H{o}s, who asked how rapidly a sequence of positive integers $(a_k)$ can grow if both series $\sum_k 1/a_k$ and $\sum_k 1/(a_k+1)$ have rational sums. Our construction of double exponentially growing sequences $(a_k)$ with this property generalizes to any number $d$ of series $\sum_k 1/(a_k+j)$, $j=0,1,2,\ldots,d-1$, and, in particular, also gives a positive answer to a question of Erd\H{o}s and Ernst Straus on the interior of the set of $d$-tuples of their sums. Finally, we prove the existence of a sequence $(a_k)$ such that all well-defined sums $\sum_k 1/(a_k+t)$, $t\in\mathbb{Z}$, are rational numbers, giving a negative answer to a conjecture by Kenneth Stolarsky.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>If $A$ and $B$ are subsets of an abelian group, their sumset is $A+B:=\{a+b:a\in A, b\in B\}$. We study sumsets in discrete abelian groups, where at least one summand has positive upper Banach density. Renling Jin proved that if $A$ and $B$ are sets of integers having positive upper Banach density, then $A+B$ is piecewise syndetic. Bergelson, Furstenberg, and Weiss improved the conclusion to "$A+B$ is piecewise Bohr." Beiglb\"ock, Bergelson, and Fish showed this to be qualitatively optimal, in the sense that if $C\subseteq \mathbb Z$ is piecewise Bohr, then there are $A, B\subseteq \mathbb Z$ having positive upper Banach density such that $A+B\subseteq C$. We improve these results by establishing a strong correspondence between sumsets in discrete abelian groups, level sets of convolutions in compact abelian groups, and sumsets in compact abelian groups. Our proofs avoid measure preserving dynamics and nonstandard analysis, and our results apply to discrete abelian groups of any cardinality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Two competing algorithms for solving Abel's equation $g(\theta(x)) = g(x) + 1$, given $\theta(x)$, have lately occupied our attention. For $\theta(x) = x (1 - x^2)$, the EJ method outperforms the ML method, consistent with experience. An immense surprise, however, lay in store for us. Two other cubics, $x (1 - x + x^2)$ and $x (1 - x)^2$, display unexpectedly erratic behavior under EJ. The reliability of EJ is consequently in question; our wavering loyalty has shifted back to ML.</p></details>

Let $x$ be large, and assume that, for some real number $\tau$, the quantities $r(p)-\Re\{f(p)/p^{i\tau}\}$ are small in various appropriate average senses over the set of prime numbers not exceeding $x$. We derive from recent effective mean-value estimates an effective comparison theorem between the mean-values of $f$ and of $r$ on the set of integers $\leqslant x$. We also provide effective estimates for certain weighted moments of additive functions and for sifted mean-values of non-negative multiplicative functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article we study the endomorphism algebras of abelian varieties $A$ defined over a given number field $K$ with large cyclic 2-torsion fields. A key step in doing so is to provide criteria for all the endomorphisms of $A$ to be defined over $K(A[2])$, the field generated by its 2-torsion. When $K= \mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(A[2])/\mathbb{Q})$ is cyclic of prime order $p = 2 \dim(A) +1$, we prove the somewhat surprising result that there are only finitely many possibilities for the geometric endomorphism algebra $\mathrm{End}(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$.In fact, when $\dim (A) \not \in \{3,5,9,21,33,81\}$, we show $\mathrm{End}(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ is a proper subfield of the $p$-th cyclotomic field. In particular, when $g=2$, $\mathrm{End}(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to either $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we relate recent work of Yuan--Zhang and Song on adelic line bundles over quasi-projective arithmetic varieties to recent advances in pluripotential theory on global Berkovich spaces from Pille-Schneider. In particular, we establish an equivalence between subcategories of adelic line bundles on quasi-projective varieties and line bundles on their Berkovich analytifications equipped with a continuous plurisubharmonic metric. We also provide several applications of this equivalence. For example, we generalize a construction of Pille-Schneider concerning families of Monge--Amp\`ere measures on analytifications of projective arithmetic varieties to the quasi-projective setting. With this construction, we offer a new description of non-degenerate subvarieties which involves Monge--Amp\`ere measures over trivially valued fields. Finally, we define a Monge--Amp\`ere measure on the analytification of a quasi-projective arithmetic variety.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G \leq \operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ be a non-trivial finite group, acting on $R = \mathbb{C}[x_1, x_2, x_3]$. The resulting skew-group algebra $R \ast G$ is $3$-Calabi-Yau, and can sometimes be endowed with the structure of a $3$-preprojective algebra. However, not every such $R \ast G$ admits such a structure. The finite subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ are classified into types (A) to (L). We consider the groups $G$ of types (C) and (D) and determine for each such group whether the algebra $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective structure. We show that the algebra $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective structure if and only if $9 \mid |G|$. Our proof is constructive and yields a description of the involved $2$-representation infinite algebras. This is based on the semi-direct decomposition $G \simeq N \rtimes K$ for an abelian group $N$, and we show that the existence of a $3$-preprojective structure on $R \ast G$ is essentially determined by the existence of one on $R \ast N$. This provides new classes of $2$-representation infinite algebras, and we discuss some $2$-Auslander-Platzeck-Reiten tilts. Along the way, we give a detailed description of the involved groups and their McKay quivers by iteratively applying skew-group constructions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a number field $K$ let $\mathcal{S}_K$ be the maximal subgroup of the multiplicative group $K^\times$ that embeds into the unit circle under each embedding of $K$ into the complex numbers. The group $\mathcal{S}_K$ can be seen as an archimedean counterpart to the group of units $\mathcal{O}_K^\times$ of the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$. If $K=\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal{S}_K)$ is a CM-field then $\mathcal{S}_K/{\mathop{\rm Tor}\nolimits}(K^\times)$ is a free abelian group of infinite rank. If $K=\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal{S}_K)$ is not a CM-field then $\mathcal{S}_K=\{\pm 1\}$. In the former case $\mathcal{S}_K$ is the kernel of the relative norm map from $K^\times$ to the multiplicative subgroup $k^\times$ of the maximal totally real subfield $k$ of $K$.</p></details>
