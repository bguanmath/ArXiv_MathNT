### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13108v2'>2408.13108</a>\]&nbsp; **Logarithmic morphisms, tangential basepoints, and little disks**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Clément Dupont, Erik Panzer, Brent Pym &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop the theory of "virtual morphisms" in logarithmic algebraic geometry, introduced by Howell. It allows one to give algebro-geometric meaning to various useful maps of topological spaces that do not correspond to morphisms of (log) schemes in the classical sense, while retaining functoriality of key constructions. In particular, we explain how virtual morphisms provide a natural categorical home for Deligne's theory of tangential basepoints: the latter are simply the virtual morphisms from a point. We also extend Howell's results on the functoriality of Betti and de Rham cohomology. Using this framework, we lift the topological operad of little $2$-disks to an operad in log schemes over the integers, whose virtual points are isomorphism classes of stable marked curves of genus zero equipped with a tangential basepoint. The gluing of such curves along marked points is performed using virtual morphisms that transport tangential basepoints around the curves. This builds on Vaintrob's analogous construction for framed little disks, for which the classical notion of morphism in logarithmic geometry sufficed. In this way, we obtain a direct algebro-geometric proof of the formality of the little disks operad, following the strategy envisioned by Beilinson. Furthermore, Bar-Natan's parenthesized braids naturally appear as the fundamental groupoids of our moduli spaces, with all virtual basepoints defined over the integers.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Thomas Beretti &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $C\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ be a convex body, and let $\mathcal{P}\subset[0,1)^2$ be a set of $N$ points. The discrepancy of $\mathcal{P}$ with respect to $C$ is defined as \begin{equation*} \mathcal{D}(\mathcal{P},\, C)=\sum_{\mathbf{p}\in\mathcal{P}}\sum_{\mathbf{n}\in\mathbb{Z}^2}\mathds{1}_C(\mathbf{p}+\mathbf{n})-N|C|. \end{equation*} A standard approach for estimating how a point distribution deviates from uniformity is to average the latter quantity over a family of sets; in particular, when considering quadratic averages over translations and dilations, one obtains \begin{equation*} \mathcal{D}_2(\mathcal{P},\, C)=\int_{0}^{1}\int_{[0,1)^2}\left|\mathcal{D}( \mathcal{P},\,\boldsymbolτ+δC)\right|^2\,{\rm d}\boldsymbolτ\,{\rm d} δ. \end{equation*} This paper concerns the behaviour of optimal \textit{homothetic quadratic discrepancy} \begin{equation*} \inf_{\# \mathcal{P}=N} \mathcal{D}_2(\mathcal{P},\, C)\quad\text{as}\quad N\to+\infty. \end{equation*} Beck and Chen \cite{MR1489133} showed that the optimal \textit{h.q.d.} of convex polygons has an order of growth of $\log N$. More recently, Brandolini and Travaglini \cite{MR4358540} showed that the optimal \textit{h.q.d.} of planar convex bodies has an order of growth of $N^{1/2}$ if their boundary is $\mathcal{C}^2$, and of $N^{2/5}$ if their boundary is only piecewise-$\mathcal{C}^2$ and not polygonal. We show that, in general, no order of growth is required. First, by an implicit geometric construction, we show that one can obtain prescribed oscillations from a logarithmic order of $\log N$ to polynomial orders of $N^{2/5}$ and $N^{1/2}$, and vice versa. Secondly, by using Fourier-analytic methods, we show that prescribed polynomial-order oscillations in the range $N^α$ with $α\in(2/5,1/2)$ are achievable.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $Γ$ a quiver without 1-cycles, we show that the Braverman--Finkelberg--Najakima quantized $K$-theoretic Coulomb branch algebra $\mathscr{A}_Γ$ of the corresponding quiver gauge theory is isomorphic to the quantized universally Laurent algebra (upper cluster $X$-algebra) associated to an explicit initial seed $Π_Γ$. We also show that $Π_Γ$ admits a cluster Donaldson--Thomas transformation as defined by Keller.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Coxeter and Dynkin diagrams classify a wide variety of structures, most notably finite reflection groups, lattices having such groups as symmetries, compact simple Lie groups and complex simple Lie algebras. The simply laced or "ADE" Dynkin diagrams also classify finite subgroups of SU(2) and quivers with finitely many indecomposable representations. This introductory tour of Coxeter and Dynkin diagrams, based on the column This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics, is made to accompany a series of lecture videos.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the analogue of Malle's conjecture for the global function field $\F_q(t)$ with $q$ sufficiently large, including a precise formula for the leading constant. The main ingredients are the recent breakthrough of Landesman--Levy on the stable homology of Hurwitz spaces, a novel interpretation of the Frobenius fixed components of Hurwitz spaces in terms of the Brauer group of the stack $BG$ and an interpretation of the number of $\F_q$ points of configuration spaces as a certain Tamagawa volume.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Mounir Hayani &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We confirm Chebyshev's observation that primes are strikingly more abundant in non-square residue classes modulo a fixed integer under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) by proving a (natural) density $1$ statement for prime counting functions in residue classes where each prime is weighted by its inverse square root. In contrast to the majority of the existing literature on the subject, we do not need to restrict to logarithmic densities to measure Chebyshev's bias, and we do not rely on any hypothesis on the zeros of $L$-functions that is stronger than GRH.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Lior Silberberg &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the relationship between the representation theory of the quantum affine algebra $\mathcal{U}_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_\infty})$ of infinite rank, and that of the quantum toroidal algebra $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_{2n,\mathrm{tor}})$. Using monoidal categorifications due to Hernandez-Leclerc and Nakajima, we establish a cluster-theoretic interpretation of the folding map $φ_{2n}$ of $q$-characters, introduced by Hernandez. To this end, we introduce a notion of foldability for cluster algebras arising from infinite quivers and study a specific case of cluster algebras of type $A_\infty$. Using this interpretation of $φ_{2n}$, we prove a conjecture of Hernandez in new cases. Finally, we study a particular simple $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_{2n,\mathrm{tor}})$-module whose $q$-character is not a cluster variable, and conjecture that it is imaginary.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Pascal Boyer &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the strict semi stable reduction situation, we describe the various filtrations of the perverse sheaf of nearby cycles in terms of irreducible perverse sheaves together with the action of the monodromy operator. We then study the spectral sequences associated to these filtration computing the sheaf cohomology groups. Finally we propose an illustration of how it can be used to compute the cohomology groups. Considering the similarity with the results of my paper at Duke Math. Journal,, it could be a good introduction before reading loc. cit.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ali Alsetri, Xuancheng Shao &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages. Referee's comments incorporated

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We extend the classical Burgess estimates to character sums over proper generalized arithmetic progressions (GAPs) of rank $2$ in prime fields $\mathbb{F}_p$. The core of our proof is a sharp upper bound for the multiplicative energy of these sets, established by adapting an argument of Konyagin and leveraging tools from the geometry of numbers. A key step in our argument involves establishing new upper bounds for the sizes of Bohr sets, which may be of independent interest.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02316v3'>2501.02316</a>\]&nbsp; **Cyclic quantum Teichmüller theory**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tsukasa Ishibashi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 78 pages, 13 figures. v3: Structure of the paper reorganized. Changed the names of invariants. Other corrections

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Based on the pioneering ideas of Kashaev [Kas98,Kas00], we present a fully explicit construction of a finite-dimensional projective representation of the dotted Ptolemy groupoid when the quantum parameter $q$ is a root of unity, which reproduces the central charge of the $SU(2)$ Wess--Zumino--Witten model. A basic ingredient is the cyclic quantum dilogarithm [FK94]. A notable contribution of this work is a reinterpretation of the relations among the parameters in the cyclic quantum dilogarithm to ensure its pentagon identity in terms of the mutations of coefficients. In particular, we find the dual roles of these parameters: as coefficients in quantum cluster algebras and as the central characters of quantum cluster variables. We also provide a geometric method to decompose the space of quantum states into irreducible modules of the Chekhov--Fock algebra. We introduce two versions of quantum intertwiners associated with a mapping class: on the entire representation space and on each irreducible component, each being an explicit composite of cyclic quantum dilogarithm operators. We prove that the former gives an intertwiner of local representations of quantum Teichmüller space in the sense of Bai--Bonahon--Liu [BBL07], and also coincides with the transpose of the reduced quantum hyperbolic operator of Baseilhac--Benedetti [BB18]. The mutation relation of coefficients is equivalent to the quantum gluing equation. The irreducible intertwiner conjecturally coincides with the Bonahon--Liu intertwiner [BL07], and we give a partial evidence.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 7 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a real reductive Lie group and $H$ a reductive subgroup of $G$. Benoist-Kobayashi studied when $L^2(G/H)$ is a tempered representation of $G$ and in particular they gave a necessary and sufficient condition for the temperedness in terms of certain functions on Lie algebras. In this paper, we consider when $L^2(G/H)$ is equivalent to a unitary subrepresentation of $L^2(G)$ and we will give a sufficient condition for this in terms of functions introduced by Benoist-Kobayashi. As a corollary, we prove the non-existence of discrete series for homogeneous spaces $G/H$ satisfying certain conditions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jian-Rong Li, Tomasz Przezdziecki &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(\mathbf{U}, \mathbf{U}^\imath)$ be a quasi-split affine quantum symmetric pair of type $\mathsf{AIII}$. This case is of particular interest thanks to the existence of geometric realizations and Schur--Weyl dualities. We establish factorization and coproduct formulae for the Drinfeld--Cartan series $\boldsymbolΘ_i(z)$ in the Lu--Pan--Wang--Zhang `new Drinfeld'-style presentation, generalizing the split type results from [Prz23, LP25a]. As an application, we construct a boundary analogue of the $q$-character map, and show that it is compatible with Frenkel and Reshetikhin's original $q$-character homomorphism.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This survey provides a practical and algorithmic perspective on Drinfeld modules over $\mathbb F_q[T]$. Starting with the construction of the Carlitz module, we present Drinfeld modules in any rank and some of their arithmetic properties. We emphasise the analogies with elliptic curves, and in the meantime, we also highlight key differences such as their rank structure and their associated Anderson motives. This document is designed for researchers in number theory, arithmetic geometry, algorithmic number theory, cryptography, or computer algebra, offering tools and insights to navigate the computational aspects of Drinfeld modules effectively. We include detailed SageMath implementations to illustrate explicit computations and facilitate experimentation. Applications to polynomial factorisation, isogeny computations, cryptographic constructions, and coding theory are also presented.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that many tame modules of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ algebra can be explicitly constructed in a purely combinatorial way using the theory of $q$-characters. The examples include families of evaluation modules obtained from analytic continuation and automorphism twists of Verma modules of the quantum affine $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ algebra. The combinatorial bases in the modules are labeled by colored plane partitions with various properties.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Postprint version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the notion of modified Rota-Baxter operators of non-zero weight on $3$-Lie algebras and provide some examples. Next, we give various constructions of modified Rota-Baxter operators of non-zero weight according to constructions of $3$-Lie algebras. Furthermore, we define a cohomology of modified Rota-Baxter operators of non-zero weight on $3$-Lie algebras with coefficients in a suitable representation. As an application, we study formal deformations of modified Rota-Baxter operators of non-zero weight that are generated by the above-defined cohomology. In the final part of the paper, we construct two \(L_\infty[1]\)-algebra structures whose Maurer-Cartan elements correspond to relative and absolute modified Rota-Baxter \(3\)-Lie algebra structures of nonzero weight, respectively. Lastly, we compare our \(L_\infty[1]\)-algebraic approach with the deformation-controlling \(L_\infty[1]\)-algebra for relative Rota-Baxter \(3\)-Lie operators developed by Hou, Sheng, and Zhou.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: Amended abstract v3: Improved notation and clarity in 3.3

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We completely classify Laurent series converging on the unit circle over a non-Archimedean local field (of any characteristic) that map infinitely many roots of unity to roots of unity. For a given Laurent series $f$ over a field of positive characteristic with residue field $\mathbb{F}_q$, we prove effective bounds for the number of possible roots of unity in terms of the number of zeroes of the auxilliary function $f(x^q)-f(x)^q$ on the unit circle. In characteristic $0$ our bound is still effective but also depends on the ramification degree of the base field over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ as well as the size of the coefficients of $f$. This has applications to the Manin-Mumford conjecture in $\mathbb{G}_m^2$. In characteristic $0$, this work builds upon a pigeon-hole based method by Schmidt.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Vadim Gorin, Sergei Korotkikh &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.PR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a problem with three equivalent formulations: describing Gibbs measures for five-vertex model in quadrant; classifying coherent systems on a p-deformation of the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph related to Grothendieck polynomials; finding the Martin boundary for discrete time TASEP with p-geometric jumps. We find a wide family of the Gibbs measures, parameterized by certain analytic functions. A subset of our measures have probabilistic interpretation as interacting particle systems with fixed particles speeds. In contrast to previous related boundary problems, we find that admissible speeds are not arbitrary, but must be larger than $\frac{p}{1-p}$. For this subset we further establish Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem, connecting the fluctuations to families of independent GUE eigenvalues. As a consequence, the measures from the subset are extreme points of the Martin boundary. It remains open whether our list of measures is exhaustive.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 10 pages; Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Hardy showed that $\sum_{n \ioe x}τ(n)-x(\log x +2γ-1)$ is not $o(x^{1/4})$. In this article, we prove that $\sum_{n \ioe x}τ(n)(1-\frac{x}{n})-xP(\log x)=\frac{1}{4}+O \left( \frac{\log x}{x^{1/4}} \right)$, where $P$ is a polynomial of degree 2. As a corollary, this estimate enables us to settle a conjecture surmised by Berkane, Bordellès, and Ramaré dealing with the positivity of an integral of the error term in the Dirichlet divisor problem. All results are entirely explicit and allow us to study the proximity between the remainder of the Dirichlet divisor problem and its logarithmic version.</p></details>

We prove that the normalization of $A$ can be reconstructed from $L$ by taking the intersection of all maximal discrete valuation subrings. As a corollary, taking the field of fractions induces a fully faithful functor from the category of normal affinoid integral domains over $K$ to the category of field extensions of $K$. This provides another $p$-adic analogue of the Riemann Hebbarkeitssatz.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we introduce the algebraic definitions and presentations of the virtual singular twin monoid and virtual singular twin group, denoted by $VSTM_n$ and $VST_n$, respectively, for a positive integer $n$. These structures extend the twin group $T_n$ in close analogy to how the virtual singular braid monoid and virtual singular braid group extend the classical braid group. We then construct and study representations of the group $VST_n$, for $n \geq 3$, focusing in particular on extending the representations $η_1$ and $η_2$ of $T_n$, introduced by M. Nasser, to $VST_n$ via the $2$-local extension method. To analyze the resulting representations, $η_1'$ and $η_2'$, and their properties, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for irreducibility and show that both $η_1'$ and $η_2'$ are unfaithful. Additionally, we classify all complex homogeneous $2$-local representations of $VST_n$ for every integer $n\geq 3$, providing a foundation for further investigation into representations of $VST_n$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the following problem: what is the smallest possible distance between a cubic irrational $ξ$ and a rational number $p/q$ in terms of the height $H(ξ)$ and $q$? More precisely, we consider the set $D_{3,1}$ consisting of all pairs $(u,v)$ of positive real numbers such that $|ξ- p/q| > cH^{-u}(ξ)q^{-v}$ for all cubic irrationals $ξ$ and rationals $p/q$. First, we transform this problem into one about the root separation of cubic polynomials. Second, under the assumption of the famous abc-conjecture, we give an almost complete description of $D_{3,1}$. Namely, the points $(u,v)$ with $2\le v\le 3$ that lie in the interior of $D_{3,1}$ are characterised by the inequality $u> 10-3v$. Assuming only the weaker Hall conjecture, we also obtain nontrivial results about the shape of $D_{3,1}$, although these are not as strong as those derived from the abc-conjecture. Finally, we discuss an analogue of the set $D_{3,1}$ in function fields where we are able to give an almost complete description unconditionally.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 132 pages, shortened abstract due to arXiv limits

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we develop a quantitative inverse theory for the Gowers uniformity norm $\|\cdot\|_{\mathsf{U}^4}$ in general finite abelian groups. We identify a new type of obstructions to uniformity, which we call almost-cubic polynomials. An almost-cubic polynomial $q$ on a Bohr set $B(Γ, ρ_0)$ is a function such that, for each $ρ\leq \min\{ρ_0, 1/8\}$, we have $$\|Δ_{a,b,c,d} q(x)\|_{\mathbb{T}} \leq 2^{10} ρ$$ for all $x, a,b,c,d \in B(Γ, ρ)$. Let $f : G \to \mathbb{D}$ be a function with $\|f\|_{\mathsf{U}^4} \geq c$. We prove quasipolynomial inverse theorems: $\bullet$ when $(|G|, 6) = 1$, there exists an almost-cubic $q : B(Γ, ρ)$ for $|Γ| \leq \log^{O(1)} c^{-1}$ and $ρ\geq \exp(-\log^{O(1)} c^{-1})$, and an element $t \in G$ such that $$\Big|\sum_{x \in G} 1_{B}(x) f(x + t) \mathrm{e}(q(x))\Big| \geq \exp(-\log^{O(1)} c^{-1})|G|,$$ $\bullet$ when $G = (\mathbb{Z}/2^d\mathbb{Z})^n$, there exists a cubic polynomial $q : G \to \mathbb{T}$ such that $$\Big|\sum_{x \in G} f(x)\mathrm{e}(q(x))\Big| \geq \exp(-\log^{O_d(1)} c^{-1})|G|.$$ Almost-cubic polynomials are rather rigid and we exhibit a strong connection with generalized polynomials in the case of cyclic groups, as well as with polynomials in the classical sense in the case of finite vector spaces. We also answer a question of Jamneshan, Shalom and Tao concerning the inverse theory in groups of bounded torsion. The central result from which the inverse theorems follow is a structural result for Freiman bihomomorphisms in general finite abelian groups. In our proof, we generalize methods of our previous work in the case of finite vector spaces and introduce novel ideas concerning extensions of Freiman bihomomorphisms. In the problem of extension of Freiman bihomomorphisms, genuinely new phenomena appear in general finite abelian groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In $2003$, Pei and Wang introduced higher level analogs of the classical Cohen--Eisenstein series. In recent joint work with Beckwith, we found a weight $\frac{1}{2}$ sesquiharmonic preimage of their weight $\frac{3}{2}$ Eisenstein series under $ξ_{\frac{1}{2}}$ utilizing a construction from seminal work by Duke, Imamoglu and Tóth. In further joint work with Beckwith, when restricting to prime level, we realized our preimage as a regularized Siegel theta lift and evaluated its (regularized) Fourier coefficients explicitly. This relied crucially on work by Bruinier, Funke and Imamoglu. In this paper, we extend both works to higher weights. That is, we provide a harmonic preimage of Pei and Wang's generalized Cohen--Eisenstein series under $ξ_{\frac{3}{2}-k}$, where $k > 1$. Furthermore, when restricting to prime level, we realize them as outputs of a regularized Shintani theta lift of a higher level holomorphic Eisenstein series, which builds on recent work by Alfes and Schwagenscheidt. Lastly, we evaluate the regularized Millson theta lift of a higher level Maass--Eisenstein series, which is known to be connected to the Shintani theta lift by a differential equation by earlier work of Alfes and Schwagenscheidt.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This paper has been significantly revised for the second time. An analytic pathology is resolved

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By applying the inverse Mellin transform to some simple closed form identities, a number of relationships are established that connect integrals containing Riemann's and Hurwitz' zeta functions ($ζ(s)$ and $ζ(s,a)$) and their alternating equivalents $η(s)$ and $η(s,a)$. In particular, special cases involving improper integrals containing $ζ(σ+it)$ and few other functions in the integrand are identified. Many of these integrals that do not appear in the literature, can be, and were, verified numerically. In one limit, the use of analytic continuation generates a family of improper integrals containing only the real and imaginary parts of $ζ(σ+it)$ with and without simple trigonometric factors; the associated closed form contains an (unclassified) entity that has many of the attributes of an essential singularity. Consequently, this means that the associated integrals are indeterminate (i.e. non-single valued), so a new symbol is introduced to label the indeterminism. Much of this paper examines this singularity from several angles in order to resolve the associated ambiguities, before eventually showing how it blends into the classical study of functions of real and complex variables in an unusual manner. This is done by establishing a self-consistent way to remove the singularity and thereby evaluate new members of a family of integrals of general interest that contain $ζ(s,a)$ and $η(s,a)$. Some implications are proposed.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Endosplit $p$-permutation resolutions play an instrumental role in verifying Broué's abelian defect group conjecture in numerous cases. We give a new characterization of all endosplit $p$-permutation resolutions and reduce the question of Galois descent of an endosplit $p$-permutation resolution to the Galois descent of the module it resolves. This is shown using techniques from the study of endotrivial complexes, the invertible objects of the bounded homotopy category of $p$-permutation modules. As an application, we show that a refinement of Broué's conjecture proposed by Kessar--Linckelmann holds for certain blocks of groups $G$ satisfying $G = O_{p',p,p'}(G)$ with abelian Sylow $p$-subgroup, the key reduction step in Harris--Linckelmann's verification of Broué's conjecture for all $p$-solvable groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper presents a comprehensive study of matrix Kloosterman sums, including their computational aspects, distributional behavior, and applications in cryptographic analysis. Building on the work of [Zelingher, 2023], we develop algorithms for evaluating these sums via Green's polynomials and establish a general framework for analyzing their statistical distributions. We further investigate the associated $L$-functions and clarify their relationships with symmetric functions and random matrix theory. We show that, analogous to the eigenvalue statistics of random matrices in compact Lie groups such as $SU(n)$ and $Sp(2n)$, the normalized values of matrix Kloosterman sums exhibit Sato-Tate equidistribution. Finally, we apply this framework to distinguish truly random sequences from those exhibiting subtle algebraic biases, and we propose a novel spectral test for cryptographic security based on the distributional signatures of matrix Kloosterman sums.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 31 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This series of papers is a contribution to the program of classifying $p$-blocks of finite groups up to source algebra equivalence, starting with the case of cyclic blocks. To any $p$-block $\mathbf{B}$ of a finite group with cyclic defect group $D$, Linckelmann associated an invariant $W( \mathbf{B} )$, which is an indecomposable endo-permutation module over $D$, and which, together with the Brauer tree of~$\mathbf{B} $, essentially determines its source algebra equivalence class. In Part II of our series, assuming that $p$ is an odd prime, we reduced the classification of the invariants $W( \mathbf{B} )$ arising from cyclic $p$-blocks $\mathbf{B}$ of quasisimple classical groups to the classification for cyclic $p$-blocks of quasisimple quotients of special linear or unitary groups. This objective is achieved in the present Part III.</p></details>

We relate such Reshetikhin type Yangians to Drinfeld type Yangians arising from critical cohomological Hall algebras. Several detailed examples, including the trivial, Jordan, and tripled Jordan quivers are explicitly computed. For symmetric quiver varieties with potentials, by using the smallness property of their affinization maps, we derive explicit formulas for quantum multiplication by divisors in terms of Casimir elements of the associated Lie (super)algebras, extending results from Nakajima quiver varieties to the critical setting. A similar formula in the antidominantly framed case is also obtained, which includes Hilbert schemes of points on $\mathbb C^3$ as examples.</p></details>

This formalization is based on a recent approach of Harder-Narasimhan theory by Chen and Jeannin, which reinterprets the theory in order-theoretic terms and avoids the classical dependence on algebraic geometry. As an application, we formalize the uniqueness of coprimary filtration of a finitely generated module over a noetherian ring, and the existence of the Jordan-Hölder filtration of a semistable Harder-Narasimhan game.

As before, we again wish to study counting problems which are inspired by the exciting advances of Bhargava-Shankar-Tsimerman and their collaborators on $n$-torsion point-counting in arithmetic statistics, and also by Hutz's conjecture along with Panraksa's work on $n$-periodic rational point-counting in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any prime $p\geq 3$ and for any fixed (period) $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$, the average number of distinct $n$-periodic integral points of any $\varphi_{p, c}$ modulo $p$ is unbounded or zero as $c$ tends to infinity. Inspired further by a conjecture of Hutz on any $\varphi_{p-1, c}$ for any prime $p\geq 5$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove that for any fixed (period) $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$, the average number of distinct $n$-periodic integral points of any $\varphi_{p-1, c}$ modulo $p$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$ as $c\to \infty$. Finally, we then apply density, polynomial-counting, number field-counting, and Sato-Tate equidistribution results from arithmetic statistics, and thereby obtaining a stream of counting and statistical results on irreducible polynomials, number fields, and Artin $L$-functions that arise naturally in our polynomial discrete dynamical settings.</p></details>

This should be contrasted with the previous result that the isomorphism type cannot, in general, be recovered from the maximal pronilpotent quotient.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a lower bound for the classical Kloosterman sum $S(a,b;c)$ where $(ab,c)=1$ and $c$ is an odd integer. We apply this lower bound for Kloosterman sums to derive an explicit lower bound in Petersson's trace formula, subject to a given condition. Consequently, we achieve a modified version of a theorem by Jung and Sardari, where weight $k$ and level $N$ are permitted to vary independently. Using this modified version, we get a lower bound for a weighted trace of the Hecke operator $T_n$ acting on the space $S_k(N)$, of cusp forms of weight $k$ and level $N$ with $(n,N)=1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite group $G$ and a sufficiently large (but fixed) prime power $q$ coprime to $G$ we obtain asymptotics for the number of regular Galois extensions $L/ \mathbb{F}_q(t)$, with $\mathrm{Gal}(L/\mathbb{F}_q(t)) \cong G$, ramified at a single place of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$, thus making progress on a positive characteristic analog of the Boston--Markin conjecture. We also obtain similar results for other arithmetic functions of the product of places of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ ramified in $L$, and for more general one-variable function fields over $\mathbb{F}_q$ in place of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$. Some of our proofs make crucial use of a series of recent breakthroughs by Landesman--Levy, as well as a new `vanishing of stable homology in a given direction' result for representations of braid groups arising from braided vector spaces. Other inputs include a study of (rings of coinvariants of) braided vector spaces associated to racks with $2$-cocycles, a connection between convolution of arithmetic functions and direct sums of braided vector spaces, and a Goursat lemma for racks.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 24 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the question of finding big Bruhat intervals that are poset hypercubes in the symmetric group $S_n$. Using permutations suggested by AlphaEvolve (an evolutionary coding agent developed by Google DeepMind), we were led to an unusual situation in which the agent produced a pattern which performed well for the $n$ tested, and which we show works well for general $n$. When $n$ is a power of 2 we exhibit a hypercube of dimension $O(n\log n)$, matching the largest possible dimension up to a constant multiple. Furthermore, we give an exact characterization of the vertices of this hypercube: they are precisely the \emph{dyadically well-distributed} permutations -- a simple digitwise property that already appeared in connection with Monte Carlo integration and mathematical finance. The maximal dimension of a Bruhat interval that is an hypercube in $S_n$ gives a lower bound (and possibly is equal to) the maximal possible coefficient of the second-highest degree term in the Kazhdan--Lusztig $R$-polynomial in $S_n$. As a surprising consequence, we obtain a new lower bound of order $n\log n$ for the maximal number of frozen variables appearing in the cluster algebras attached to the open Richardson varieties in $S_n$, and a similar result for moduli spaces of embeddings of Bruhat graphs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given natural parameters s and r, where $2\leq s\leq r$, we consider the distribution of a random variable $ξ=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}s^{-k}ξ_k\equivΔ^{r_s}_{ξ_1ξ_2...ξ_k...},$ where $(ξ_k)$ is a sequence of independent random variables taking values in $\{0,1,...,r\}$ with probabilities $p_0,p_1,...,p_r$, respectively, and all $ p_i<1$. In the case s=3=r, necessary and sufficient conditions for the singularity and absolute continuity of the distribution of random variable are established. The work also discusses the connection between the distribution of random variable and infinite Bernoulli convolutions governed by the corresponding series as well as representations of numbers in the base-3 numeral system with one redundant digit. Several open problems are formulated.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we consider representations of generalized $k$-linear Reedy categories $\underline{\mathscr{C}}$, a common generalization of $k$-linear Reedy categories introduced by Georgiois-Št'ovíček and $k$-linearizations of generalized Reedy categories introduced by Berger-Moerdijk, and construct abelian model structures on $\underline{\mathscr{C}} \text{-}\mathrm{Mod}$. In the first part, we show that $\underline{\mathscr{C}}$ can be viewed as an infinite categorical analogue of standardly stratified algebras. Explicitly, we give a parameterization of irreducible representations of $\underline{\mathscr{C}} \text{-}\mathrm{Mod}$, provide several sufficient criteria such that $\underline{\mathscr{C}} \text{-}\mathrm{Mod}$ is equivalent to the Cartesian product of module categories over the ``local" endomorphism algebras of $\underline{\mathscr{C}}$, and describe applications of these results to representation theory of some interesting combinatorial categories including categories of spans and the category of finite dimensional vector spaces over a finite field and linear maps. In the second part, using the technique of Grothendieck bifibrations, we glue a family of complete cotorsion pairs in the module categories of these ``local" endomorphism algebras to a complete cotorsion pair in $\underline{\mathscr{C}} \text{-}\mathrm{Mod}$, and deduce that under certain mild conditions a family of abelian model structures on these ``local" module categories can be glued to an abelian model structure on $\underline{\mathscr{C}} \text{-}\mathrm{Mod}$. As applications, we obtain a few abelian model structures on generalized $k$-linear direct or inverse categories.</p></details>

For example, each and every permutation of the $2\times2$ matrix coefficients $\{12,6,7,1\}$, generated by the Pythagorean triple $(5,12,13)$, yields a matrix with integer eigenvalues. Further, each and every Pythagorean triple in fact generates a countable infinity of nontrivially related matrices having this property.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a conjectural formula for the highest $\ell$-weight monomial of an arbitrary real module over a simply-laced quantum affine algebra. We verify the conjecture under a multiplicative reachability condition, answering the Hernandez--Leclerc classification problem in monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras under this condition. Moreover, we introduce the notion of cluster modules, generalizing Kirillov--Reshetikhin modules and Hernandez--Leclerc modules as special cases. We prove that cluster modules are reachable real modules, and obtain a system of equations governing $q$-characters of the prime cluster modules, providing a natural generalization of both the classical T-system relations for Kirillov--Reshetikhin modules and the exchange relations for Hernandez--Leclerc modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We first remind the classical analytical proof of the transcendence of $\mathrm{e}$ due to Hilbert. Then, using formal power series, we give two algebraic semiformal proofs of the same result. The first proof is a specialization of a proof of the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem given by Beukers, Bézivin and Roba [2]. The second proof uses improper integrals of formal power series and is due to this author. At the beginning, we explain what ``semiformal'' means and indicate yet another analytical proof of the transcendence of $\mathrm{e}$. Like the two algebraic proofs, it avoids uncountable sets. It is due to this author in [4].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a symmetrizable Kac--Moody algebra. We describe {standard graded} $\mathfrak{g}$-modules $V$, which we use to construct a completion $\widehat{V}$ and pro-unipotent group $\widehat{U}$ in $\GL(\widehat{V})$. These standard graded modules include the adjoint module, all integrable modules, Category~$\mathcal{O}$ modules, and opposite Category~$\mathcal{O}$ modules. We prove that the elements of $\widehat{U}$ are pro-summable series, that is, they are projective limits of summable series on quotients $\widehat{V}/\prod_{j=k}^\infty{V}_j$, for each $k>0$. We give an explicit construction of root subalgebras and their completions, corresponding to every root including the imaginary roots. We also construct complete root groups for imaginary roots, whose elements are also pro-summable series acting on $\widehat{V}$. We show that these groups are isomorphic to groups of power series in variables corresponding to basis elements for the imaginary root space.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In [J. Lond. Math.

In this paper, we study in detail the first family of nontrivial examples of the qKZ equations in characteristic $p$. We describe all solutions of these qKZ equations in characteristic $p$ by demonstrating that they all stem from the $p$-hypergeometric solutions. We also prove a Lagrangian property (called the orthogonality property) of the subbundle of the qKZ bundle spanned by the $p$-hypergeometric sections. This paper extends the results of [arXiv:2405.05159] on the differential KZ equations to the difference qKZ equations.</p></details>

Moreover, we prove the isomorphism of $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm1},t_{e}^{\pm1}]_{e\in E}$-algebras between the positive/negative half of the integral Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop group $U_{q}^{MO,\pm,\mathbb{Z}}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$ with the (opposite) algebra of the integral preprojective (nilpotent) $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+,\mathbb{Z}}_{Q}$ ($(\mathcal{A}^{+,nilp,\mathbb{Z}}_{Q})^{op}$) of the same quiver type $Q$. As the application, we prove that one can identify the wall subalgebra $U_{q}^{MO,\mathbb{Z}}(\mathfrak{g}_{w})$ as the root subalgebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{m},w}^{\mathbb{Z}}$ in the slope subalgebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{m}}^{\mathbb{Z}}$ as the quasitriangular Hopf $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm1},t_e^{\pm1}]_{e\in E}$-algebras.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Starting from an Enriques surface over $\mathbb{Q}(t)$ considered by Lafon, we give the first examples of smooth projective weakly special threefolds which fibre over the projective line in Enriques surfaces (resp. K3 surfaces) with nowhere reduced, but non-divisible, fibres and general type orbifold base. We verify that these families of Enriques surfaces (resp. K3 surfaces) are non-isotrivial and compute their fundamental groups by studying the behaviour of local points along certain étale covers. The existence of the above threefolds implies that the Weakly Special Conjecture formulated in 2000 contradicts the Orbifold Mordell Conjecture, and hence the abc conjecture. Using these examples, we can also easily disprove several complex-analytic analogues of the Weakly Special Conjecture. Finally, the existence of such threefolds shows that Enriques surfaces and K3 surfaces can have non-divisible but nowhere reduced degenerations, thereby answering a question raised in 2005.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we present algorithms for computing parabolic inductions and Jacquet modules for the general linear group $G$ over a non-Archimedean local field. Given the Zelevinsky data or Langlands data of an irreducible smooth representation $π$ of $G$ and an essentially square-integrable representation $σ$, we explicitly determine the Jacquet module of $π$ with respect to $σ$ and the socle of the normalized parabolic induction $π\times σ$. Our result builds on and extends some previous work of Mœglin-Waldspurger, Jantzen, Mínguez, and Lapid-Mínguez, and also uses other methods such as sequences of derivatives and an exotic duality. As an application, we give a simple algorithm for computing the highest derivative multisegment and an algorithm for computing the Langlands parameter of the highest Bernstein-Zelevinsky derivatives.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the Hernandez conjecture on the simple $(q,t)$-characters (an analog of the Kazhdan--Lusztig conjecture) for untwisted quantum loop algebras of classical type. This result is new in type $\mathrm{C}$. We also prove that the folding homomorphism, introduced by Hernandez, gives a dimension-preserving bijective correspondence between the finite-dimensional simple representations of untwisted quantum loop algebras of classical simply-laced type and those of the corresponding doubly-twisted quantum loop algebras. This result is new in type $\mathrm{D}$. In our approach, we develop a bootstrapping method for $q$ and $(q,t)$-characters, based on the freezing operator previously introduced in the context of cluster algebras by the second named author. This method allows us to reduce statements for general simple representations in all classical types to corresponding results on core subcategories in a uniform manner.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a non-Archimedean local field. For any irreducible smooth representation $π$ of $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$ and a multisegment $\mathfrak m$, we have an operation $D_{\mathfrak m}(π)$ to construct a simple quotient $τ$ of a Bernstein-Zelevinsky derivative of $π$. This article continues the previous one to study the following poset $$ \mathcal S(π, τ) :=\left\{ \mathfrak n : D_{\mathfrak n}(π)\cong τ\right\} , $$ where $\mathfrak n$ runs for all the multisegments. Here the partial ordering on $\mathcal S(π, τ)$ comes from the Zelevinsky ordering. We show that the poset has a unique minimal multisegment. Along the way, we introduce two new ingredients: fine chain orderings and local minimizability.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we study the mixed fourth moments of Hecke--Maass cusp forms and Eisenstein series with type $(2, 2)$. Under the assumptions of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) and the Generalized Ramanujan Conjecture (GRC), we establish asymptotic formulas for these moments. Our results give an interesting non-equidistribution phenomenon over the full fundamental domain. In fact, this independent equidistribution should be true in a compact set. We further investigate this behaviour by examining a truncated version involving truncated Eisenstein series. Additionally, we propose a conjecture on the joint value distribution of Eisenstein series. The proofs are based on the bounds of the shifted mixed moments of $L$-functions.</p></details>

For $n \in N$, let $E_n=\{1=x_k,~x_i+x_j=x_k,~x_i \cdot x_j=x_k):~i,j,k \in \{0,...,n\}\}$. For $n \in N$, $f(n)$ denotes the smallest $b \in N$ such that if a system of equations $S \subseteq E_n$ has a solution in $N^{n+1}$, then $S$ has a solution in $\{0,...,b\}^{n+1}$. The author proved earlier that the function $f:N \to N$ is computable in the limit and eventually dominates every computable function $g:N \to N$. We present a short program in MuPAD which for $n \in N$ prints the sequence $\{f_i(n)\}_{i=0}^\infty$ of non-negative integers converging to $f(n)$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Starting from the classical integral representation of the $ζ(s)$ function introduced by Riemann in 1859, this paper reexamines its analytic symmetry structure. By performing a geometric decomposition of the integral representation, we demonstrate that on the critical line $\Re(s)=\frac{1}{2}$, the value of $ξ(s)$ corresponds strictly to the \textbf{real-part projection} of a specific analytic component. This discovery equivalently transforms the problem of complex zeros into a problem of \textbf{sign evolution} along the real axis. Based on this geometric framework, we \textbf{construct} an analytic mechanism of \textbf{"Two-End Anchoring, Interval Counting"}: the global argument increment on the region boundary \textbf{anchors} the initial value of the phase function, while the geometric decomposition structure on the critical line \textbf{locks} its final value. This mechanism reveals an \textbf{intrinsic coherence} between global topological constraints and local sign oscillations. Unlike traditional methods that rely on asymptotic estimates (such as the Big $O$ error term), the analysis in this paper is \textbf{grounded in} exact identities. It unveils the \textbf{geometric determinism} underlying the zero-counting formula, offering a novel perspective for analytic number theory independent of asymptotic analysis.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb{F}_q^d$ be a $d$-dimensional vector space over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ elements. For $x\in \mathbb{F}_q^d$, let $\|x\| = x_1^2+\dots+x_d^2$. By abuse of terminology, we shall call $\|\cdot\|$ a norm on $\mathbb{F}_q^d$. For a subset $E\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$, let $Δ(E)$ be the distance set on $E$ defined as $Δ(E):=\{\|x-y\| : x, y \in E \}$. The Mattila-Sjölin problem seeks the smallest exponent $α>0$ such that $Δ(E) =\mathbb{F}_q$ for all subsets $E \subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ with $|E| \geq Cq^α$. In this article, we consider this problem for a variant of this norm, which generates a smaller distance set than the norm $\|\cdot\|.$ Namely, we replace the norm $\|\cdot\|$ by the so-called $k$-norm $(1 \leq k \leq d)$, which can be viewed as a kind of deformation of $\|\cdot\|$. To derive our result on the Mattila-Sjölin problem for the $k$-norm, we use a combinatorial method to analyze various summations arising from the discrete Fourier machinery. Even though our distance set is smaller than the one in the Mattila-Sjölin problem, for some $k$ we still obtain the same result as that of Iosevich and Rudnev (2007), which deals with the Mattila-Sjölin problem. Furthermore, our result is sharp in all odd dimensions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Research on the distribution of prime numbers has revealed a dual character: deterministic in definition yet exhibiting statistical behavior reminiscent of random processes. In this paper we show that it is possible to use an image-focused machine learning model to measure the comparative regularity of prime number fields at specific regions of an Ulam spiral. Specifically, we demonstrate that in pure accuracy terms, models trained on blocks extracted from regions of the spiral in the vicinity of 500m outperform models trained on blocks extracted from the region representing integers lower than 25m. This implies existence of more easily learnable order in the former region than in the latter. Moreover, a detailed breakdown of precision and recall scores seem to imply that the model is favouring a different approach to classification in different regions of the spiral, focusing more on identifying prime patterns at lower numbers and more on eliminating composites at higher numbers. This aligns with number theory conjectures suggesting that at higher orders of magnitude we should see diminishing noise in prime number distributions, with averages (density, AP equidistribution) coming to dominate, while local randomness regularises after scaling by log x. Taken together, these findings point toward an interesting possibility: that machine learning can serve as a new experimental instrument for number theory. Notably, the method shows potential 1 for investigating the patterns in strong and weak primes for cryptographic purposes.</p></details>

This allows us to construct sufficiently many non-ordinary regular de Rham points whose modularity is guaranteed by the recent progress on the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture. Also, we will discuss some applications of our main results, including the equidimensionality of certain big Hecke algebras and big $R=\mathbb{T}$ theorems in the residually reducible case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By introducing a generalized notion of multiple zeta values associated with an arbitrary finite subset $S\subset \mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$ and studying their transformation properties under rational functions, we show that multiple polylogarithms evaluated at roots of unity (cyclotomic multiple zeta values, CMZVs) can be equivalently expressed in terms of iterated integrals involving certain non-roots of unity. We apply this theory to elucidate previously unknown $\mathbb{Q}$-linear relations among CMZVs: they come from nontrivial solutions of certain $S$-unit equations in the function field of $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$, thereby attaining the motivic dimension for low level and weight. We introduce a datamine of CMZVs that appears to be the first rigorous compilation of this kind in the literature. In addition, we formulate several nontrivial Galois descent conjectures for multiple polylogarithms and present applications to certain Apéry-type infinite series.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We calculate the deformed and non-deformed cohomological Hall algebra (CoHA) of the preprojective algebra for the case of cyclic quivers by studying the Kontsevich-Soibelman CoHA and using tools from cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory. We show that for the cyclic quiver of length $K$, this algebra is the universal enveloping algebra of the positive half of a certain extension of matrix differential operators on $\mathbb{C}^{*}$, while its deformation gives a positive half of an explicit integral form of Guay's Affine Yangian $\ddot{\mathcal{Y}}_{\hbar_1,\hbar_2}(\mathfrak{gl}(K))$. By the main theorem of Botta-Davison (2023) and Schiffmann-Vasserot (2023), we also determine the Maulik-Okounkov Yangian for the case of cyclic quivers. Furthermore, we explain the construction of factorization coproduct, provide evidence for the strong rationality conjecture, calculate the spherical subalgebra of the non-deformed CoHA for any quiver without loops, recover results about the CoHA of compactly supported semistable sheaves on the minimal resolution of the Kleinian singularity $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_{K}$ and identify a commutative algebra inside the additive shuffle algebra associated to the cyclic quiver. We end by conjecturally relating the obtained integral form with the algebra defined by Gaiotto-Rapčák-Zhou, in the context of twisted M-theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the variety $(k^{n\times n})^{p}$ under the action of $GL_{n}$ by simultaneous similarity. We define discrete and continuous invariants which completely determine the orbits. The discrete invariants induce a disjoint decomposition of the variety into finitely many locally closed $GL_{n}$-stable subsets and for each of these we construct finitely many invariant morphisms to $k$ separating the orbits. The complicated action of $GL_{n}$ by similarity is reduced to left multiplication of a product of $GL_{l_{i}}$'s on a product of $k^{l_{i}\times m_{i}}$'s. An analogous result holds for the left-right action of $GL_{m}\times GL_{n}$ on $(k^{m\times n })^{p}$ and more general for all varieties of finite dimensional modules over some finitely generated algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce multiple zeta dagger values and special values of Carlitz multiple dagger polylogarithms, and study their properties. In particular, using these values, we construct a non-trivial involution on a certain quotient space of multiple zeta values in positive characteristic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish improved bounds for bilinear forms with Kloosterman fractions of the form ${\sum\sum}_{m,n} α_m β_n e(a\overline{m}/(bn))$ with $M<m\le 2M$, $N < n \le 2N$ and $(m,n)=1$. Our approach works directly with arbitrary coefficient sequences $(α_m), (β_n) \in \mathbb{C}$, avoiding the temporary restriction to squarefree support used in prior work. While this requires handling additional arithmetic complexity, it yields strictly stronger bounds that improve upon the estimates of Duke, Friedlander, and Iwaniec \cite{DFI} and Bettin-Chandee \cite{BC}; in the balanced case $M \approx N$, the new saving over the trivial bound is $1/12$%, compared to $1/48$ in \cite{DFI} . As an application, we prove a generalized asymptotic formula for the twisted second moment of the Riemann zeta-function with Dirichlet polynomials of length $T^{1/2+δ}$ for $δ= 1/46$, extending beyond the previously limiting $θ= 1/2$ barrier established by Bettin, Chandee, and Radziwiłł \cite{BCR}. We also establish bounds for related Hermitian sums involving Salié-type exponential phases and develop techniques for more general bilinear forms with Kloosterman fractions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be prime number and $K$ be a $p$-adic field. We systematically compute the higher $\mathrm{Ext}$-groups between locally analytic generalized Steinberg representations (LAGS for short) of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ via a new combinatorial treatment of some spectral sequences arising from the so-called Tits complex. Such spectral sequences degenerate at the second page and each $\mathrm{Ext}$-group admits a canonical filtration whose graded pieces are terms in the second page of the corresponding spectral sequence. For each pair of LAGS, we are particularly interested their $\mathrm{Ext}$-groups in the bottom two non-vanishing degrees. We write down an explicit basis for each graded piece (under the canonical filtration) of such an $\mathrm{Ext}$-group, and then describe the cup product maps between such $\mathrm{Ext}$-groups using these bases. As an application, we generalize Breuil's $\mathscr{L}$-invariants for $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ and Schraen's higher $\mathscr{L}$-invariants for $\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ to $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$. Along the way, we also establish a generalization of Bernstein--Zelevinsky geometric lemma to admissible locally analytic representations constructed by Orlik--Strauch, generalizing a result in Schraen's thesis for $\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{Q}_p)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using Watt's mean value theorem and a delicate sieve decomposition, the author shows that the interval $[x, x+x^{\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon}]$ contains an integer with a prime factor larger than $x^{\frac{35}{36}-\varepsilon}$ for sufficiently large $x$. This gives a solution with $γ= \frac{1}{36}$ to the Exercise 5.1 in Harman's monograph and improves the previous record of the author proved in 2024, where $γ= \frac{1}{26.5}$ is obtained.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a sufficiently dense subset of a finite field $\mathbb F_q$ or a finite, cyclic ring $\mathbb Z/ N\mathbb Z$. Assuming that $q$ and $N$ have no small prime divisors, we show that generalised Fermat equations have the expected number of solutions over $A$. We further show that our density threshold is optimal. Our proofs involve average Fourier decay for Bohr sets, mixed character sum bounds, equidistribution of polynomial sequences, popular Cauchy--Davenport lemmas, and a regularity-type lemma due to Semchankau.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a small, connected category with finite hom-sets. We show that if the embedding of a connected subcategory $\mathcal{J}$ is both initial and final, then the restriction of any $\mathcal{C}$-module along $\mathcal{J}$ preserves the generalized rank-or equivalently, the multiplicity of the ``entire" interval modules for $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{J}$. Conversely, we prove that this property characterizes initial and final embeddings when both $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{J}$ are posets satisfying certain mild constraints and the embedding is full. For $\mathcal{C}$ a poset under these conditions, we describe the minimal full subposet whose embedding is initial or final. This generalizes an observation made by Dey and Lesnick. We also extend a result of Kinser on the generalized rank invariant to small categories.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Though Joyal's species are known to categorify generating functions in enumerative combinatorics, they also categorify zeta functions in algebraic geometry. The reason is that any scheme $X$ of finite type over the integers gives a "zeta species" $Z_X$, and any species $F$ gives a Dirichlet series $\widehat{F}$, in such a way that $\widehat{Z}_X$ is the arithmetic zeta function of $X$, a well-known Dirichlet series that encodes the number of points of $X$ over each finite field. Specifically, a $Z_X$-structure on a finite set is a way of making that set into a semisimple commutative ring, say $k$, and then choosing a $k$-point of the scheme $X$. This is an elaboration of joint work with James Dolan.</p></details>
