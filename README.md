<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The concept of cluster towers was introduced by the second author and Krithika in [4] along with a question which was answered by the first author and Bhagwat in [1]. In this article we introduce the concept of minimal generating sets of splitting field and connect it to the concept of cluster towers. We establish that there exist infinitely many irreducible polynomials over rationals for which the splitting field has two extreme minimal generating sets (one of given cardinality and other of minimum cardinality) and for which we have two extreme minimal cluster towers (one of given length and other of minimum length). More generally, we establish that for a certain family of polynomials over the rationals, we have minimal generating sets of all cardinalities in a certain range and that these are the only possible cardinalities for minimal generating set for such a polynomial. We also establish an equivalent condition for a set to be minimum minimal generating set for this family of polynomials and count the total number of minimum minimal generating sets. We prove interesting properties of cluster tower associated with minimal generating set that we constructed in proof of the first theorem and as a consequence get that degree sequence depends on the ordering even when we work with minimal generating set.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a global field, $K/k$ be a finite separable field extension and $L/k$ be the Galois closure of $K/k$ with Galois groups $G={\rm Gal}(L/k)$ and $H={\rm Gal}(L/K)\lneq G$. In 1931, Hasse proved that if $G$ is cyclic, then the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. We show that if $G$ is metacyclic with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$, then $H$ is cyclic and the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. Some examples of metacyclic, dihedral, quasidihedral, modular, generalized quoternion, extraspecial groups and $Z$-groups $G$ with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$ are given. As a consequence, we get the Tamagawa number $\tau(T)=|G^{ab}|/|H|$ of the norm one tori $T=R^{(1)}_{K/k}(\mathbb{G}_m)$ of $K/k$ via Ono's formula $\tau(T)=|H^1(k,\widehat{T})|/|Sha(T)|$ where $G^{ab}$ is the abelianization of $G$, $\widehat{T}={\rm Hom}(T,\mathbb{G}_m)$ is the character module of $T$ and $Sha(T)$ is the Shafarevich-Tate group of $T$. As an appendix of this paper, we also give some examples of finite simple groups $G$ with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$. This provides examples which the Hasse norm principle holds for Galois extensions $K/k$ with $G={\rm Gal}(K/k)$ by Tate's theorem.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Mladen Dimitrov, Andrei Jorza &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct $p$-adic $L$-functions for regularly refined cuspidal automorphic representations of symplectic type on $\mathrm{GL}_{2n}$ over totally real fields, which are parahoric spherical at every finite place. Furthermore, we prove etaleness of the parabolic eigenvariety at such points and construct $p$-adic $L$-functions in families. The novel local ingredients are the construction of improved Ash--Ginzburg Shalika functionals and production of Friedberg--Jacquet test vectors relating local zeta integrals to automorphic $L$-functions beyond the spherical level. Our proofs rely on a generalization of Shahidi's theory of local coefficients to Shalika models, for which we establish a general factorization formula related to the exterior square automorphic $L$-function.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04860v2'>2411.04860</a>\]&nbsp; **Hyperrigidity II: $R$-dilations, ideals and decompositions**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Paweł Pietrzycki, Jan Stochel &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.OA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the hyperrigidity of subsets of unital $C^*$-algebras annihilated by states (or, more generally, by completely positive maps). This is closely related to the concept of rigidity at $0$ introduced by G. Salomon, who studied hyperrigid subsets of Cuntz and Cuntz-Krieger algebras. The absence of the unit in a hyperrigid set allows for the existence of $R$-dilations with non-isometric $R$. The existence of such an $R$-dilation forces the state annihilating the hyperrigid set to be a character. Using a dilation-theoretic approach, we provide multiple equivalent criteria for hyperrigidity involving intertwining relations for representations, valid in both commutative and noncommutative settings. We develop structural models for such dilations via orthogonal decompositions into two or three components, determined by defect operators and generalized eigenspaces associated with underlying representations.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22323v3'>2503.22323</a>\]&nbsp; **On the intertwining differential operators between vector bundles over the real projective space of dimension two**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Toshihisa Kubo, Bent Ørsted &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 37 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The main objective of this paper is twofold. One is to classify and construct $SL(3,\mathbb{R})$-intertwining differential operators between vector bundles over the real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^2$. It turns out that two kinds of operators appear. We call them Cartan operators and PRV operators. The second objective is then to study the representations realized on the kernel of those operators both in the smooth and holomorphic setting. A key machinery is the BGG resolution. In particular, by exploiting some results of Davidson-Enright-Stanke and Enright-Joseph, the irreducible unitary highest weight modules of $SU(1,2)$ at the (first) reduction points are classified by the image of Cartan operators and kernel of PRV operators.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A subset $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathbb{Z}$ is called $s$-almost square universal if every sufficiently large positive integer can be written as a sum of at most $s$ squares of integers from $\mathcal{A}$. In this article, we study the minimal number $\mathrm{ASU}(\mathcal{A}_{d,m})$ with this property, where $\mathcal{A}_{d,m}$ denotes the residue class of $d$ modulo $m$, with $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and $d\in\mathbb{Z}$. We further prove that $\mathcal{A}_{d,m}$ is $s$-square universal for some $s\in\mathbb{N}$ if and only if $d \equiv \pm 1 \pmod{m}$, and determine the minimal such number $\mathrm{SU}(\mathcal{A}_{d,m})$ in these cases.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08003v1'>2508.08003</a>\]&nbsp; **Counting Salem numbers arising from arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Michelle Chu, Plinio G. P. Murillo, Otto Romero, Lola Thompson &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 18 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The relationship between Salem numbers and short geodesics has been fruitful in quantitative studies of arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds, particularly in dimensions 2 and 3. In this article, we push these connections even further. The primary goals are: (1) to bound the proportion of Salem numbers of degree up to $n+1$ in the commensurability class of classical arithmetic lattices in any odd dimension $n$; (2) to improve lower bounds for the strong exponential growth of averages of multiplicities in the geodesic length spectrum of non-compact arithmetic orbifolds. In order to accomplish these goals, we bound, for a fixed square-free integer $D$, the count of Salem numbers with minimal polynomial $f$ satisfying $f(1)f(-1)=-D$ in $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}/\mathbb{Q}^{\times 2}$. To do this, we make use of results on the distribution of Salem numbers, as well as classical methods for counting Pythagorean triples and Gauss' lattice-counting argument. To this end, we give a generalization of the count of Pythagorean triples and provide an elementary proof which may be of independent interest.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 14 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The sequences of $\mathrm{SL}(2,{\mathbb N})$-saturated Farey fractions were defined in our previous work as ${\mathscr S}_Q := \{ a/q \in {\mathbb Q} \cap (0,1]: q+a+\bar{a} \le Q\}$, where $\bar{a}$ is the multiplicative inverse of $a\pmod{q}$ in $[1,q)$. Here, we prove that the set of $Q$-scaled denominators of consecutive fractions in ${\mathscr S}_Q$ is dense in the region ${\mathcal V}:=\{ (x,y)\in [0,1]^2 : \max \{ (1-3x)/2,2x-1\} \le y \le \max \{ x,1-x\} \}$, and provide a formula for their distribution in ${\mathcal V}$ as $Q\rightarrow \infty$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we show that given a finite p-group G, a number field K having a trivial p-class group Cl K , and a finite set of primes S of K, there exists a finite extension F/K such that the S-split p-Hilbert class field tower L S p (F ) of F has G as its Galois group. This extends results by Ozaki and Hajir-Maire-Ramakrishna.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 11 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A positive definite and integral quadratic form $f$ is called irrecoverable if there is a quadratic form $F$ such that it represents all proper subforms of $f$, whereas it does not represent $f$ itself. In this case, $F$ is called an isolation of $f$. In this article, we prove that there does not exist a binary isolation of any unary quadratic form. We also prove that there does not exist a ternary isolation of any binary quadratic form. Furthermore, if the form class group of a primitive binary quadratic form has no element of order $4$, then the discriminant of any quaternary isolation of it, if exists, is a square of an integer. The composition laws of primitive binary quadratic forms play an essential role in the proofs of the results.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 10 pages. Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The P\'{o}lya group $Po(K)$ of an algebraic number field $K$ is the subgroup of the ideal class group $Cl_{K}$ generated by the ideal classes of the products of prime ideals of the same norm. If $Po(K)$ is trivial, then the number field $K$ is said to be a P\'{o}lya field. In this article, we furnish three families $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p},\sqrt{qrs})$, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2p},\sqrt{qrs})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2p},\sqrt{2qrs})$ of bi-quadratic P\'{o}lya fields $K$ involving prime numbers $p,q,r$ and $s$ that satisfy certain quadratic residue conditions. It is worthwhile to note that in each of the fields, exactly five primes ramify in $K/\mathbb{Q}$ and this is the maximum possible number of ramified primes in a P\'{o}lya field over $\mathbb{Q}$. Towards the end of the paper, we discuss about large P\'{o}lya groups of the compositums of Shank's cubic fields and Lehmer's quintic fields and prove that there are infinitely many such fields with index $1$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is concerned with the problem of finding two sets of integers, $\{a_1, a_2, \ldots$, $a_m\}$ and $\{b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n\}$, such that all the $mn$ sums $a_i+b_j, i=1, \ldots, m, j=1, \ldots, n$, are perfect squares. A method is known for generating numerical examples of such sets when $m=2$ or 3 and $n$ is arbitrary. When both $m$ and $n$ exceed 2, only one two-parameter solution with $(m, n)=(4, 4)$ has been published. In this paper we obtain several multi-parameter solutions of the problem in three cases when $(m, n)$ is $(3, 3)$ or $(5, 3)$ or $(4, 4)$, and we indicate how more such solutions may be obtained.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Shenghao Hua &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 14 pages. Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Keating--Snaith conjecture for orthogonal families may be viewed as analogous to a Gaussian distribution with a negative mean, and the possibility that mixed moments resemble a composition of independent moments, these two insights were combined and applied in Lester and Radziwi\l\l's proof of quantum unique ergodicity for half-integral weight automorphic forms, via Soundararajan's method under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH). This observation also yields a crucial and nontrivial saving in the resolution of certain arithmetic problems. Inspired by this, we select a series of typical mixed orthogonal families of $L$-functions: $\mathrm{GL}_2$ quadratic twisted families. Under the assumptions of the GRH and the Generalized Ramanujan Conjecture, we prove upper bound estimates for their moments and present the following three arithmetic applications: i) The decorrelation of automorphic periods averaged over imaginary quadratic fields. ii) The decorrelation of Fourier coefficients of half-integral weight modular forms. iii) The decorrelation of the analytic orders of isotropy subgroups of Tate--Shafarevich groups of elliptic curves under quadratic twists.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 43 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras are studied from the perspective of representation types. We establish that (like other representation types) the notions of $E$-finiteness and $E$-tameness are invariant under mutations of quivers with potentials. Consequently, by applying our results on laminations on marked surfaces, and the results of Plamondon and the second author, we classify $E$-finite and $E$-tame finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras. More precisely, we demonstrate that (resp., except for a few cases,) a finite-dimensional Jacobian algebra $\mathcal{J}(Q,W)$ is $E$-finite (resp., $E$-tame) if and only if it is $\mathrm{g}$-finite (resp., $\mathrm{g}$-tame), if and only if it is representation-finite (resp., representation-tame), and this holds exactly when $Q$ is of Dynkin type (resp., finite mutation type), as shown by Geiss, Labardini and Schr\"{o}er. Futhermore, we provide an application of our results in the theory of cluster algebras. More precisely, the converse of Reading's theorem is established: if the $\mathrm{g}$-fan of the cluster algebra associated with a connected quiver $Q$ is complete, then $Q$ must be of Dynkin type.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Accepted in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For each integer $n\geq 1$, we construct a $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb Q)$-invariant modular symbol $\bm\xi_n$ with coefficients in a space of distributions that takes values in the Milnor $K_n$-group of the modular function field. The Siegel distribution $\bm\mu$ on $\mathbb Q^2$, with values in the modular function field, serves as the building block for $\bm\xi_n$; we define $\bm\xi_n$ essentially by taking the $n$-Steinberg product of $\bm\mu$. The most non-trivial part of this construction is the cocycle property of $\bm\xi_n$; we prove it by using an induction on $n$ based on the first two cases $\bm\xi_1$ and $\bm\xi_2$; the first case is trivial, and the second case essentially follows from the fact that Beilinson-Kato elements in the Milnor $K_2$-group modulo torsion satisfy the Manin relations.</p></details>

We show that if $X/k$ has four geometric singular fibers and either $X(\mathbb{A}_k)\neq \emptyset$ or $X/k$ has non-trivial Brauer group, then $X$ satisfies the Hasse principle over any even degree extension $L/k$. Furthermore for arbitrary $X$ we show that, conditional on Schinzel's hypothesis, $X$ satisfies the Hasse principle over all but finitely many quadratic extensions of $k$. We prove these results by showing the Brauer-Manin obstruction vanishes and then apply fibration method results of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene, following Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Sansuc.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A rooted tree module (RTM) $M:=M(T,F)$ over a zero-relation algebra $\Lambda:=\mathcal KQ/\langle\rho\rangle$ over a field $\mathcal K$ is given by the data of a quiver morphism $F:T\to Q$ from a rooted tree $T$ (either with a source or a sink) taking paths in $T$ to paths in $Q$ not lying in $\langle\rho\rangle$. When $\mathrm{char}(\mathcal K)\neq2$, we provide a checkable combinatorial characterization of the indecomposability of the RTM $M$ in terms of non-existence of idempotent quiver morphisms $\iota:T\to T$ satisfying $F\circ\iota=F$ and $\iota\neq 1_T$. Further, we provide an iterative method to decompose an RTM into indecomposable RTMs as well as a method to recursively construct indecomposable RTMs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a finite group and $k$ a field of prime characteristic $p$. We examine the Lefschetz homomorphism $\Lambda: \mathcal{E}_k(G) \to O(T(kG))$ from the group of endotrivial complexes, i.e. the Picard group of the bounded homotopy category of $p$-permutation modules $K^b({}_{kG}\mathbf{triv})$, to the orthogonal unit group of the Grothendieck group of $K^b({}_{kG}\mathbf{triv})$, i.e. the trivial source ring. When $p = 2$ and $k = \mathbb{F}_2$, $\Lambda$ is surjective when $G$ has a Sylow $2$-subgroup with fusion controlled by its normalizer, and when $G$ has dihedral Sylow $2$-subgroups. When $p$ is odd, $\Lambda$ is surjective if $G$ has a cyclic Sylow $p$-subgroup or is $p$-nilpotent, but we exhibit examples of groups of $p$-rank 2 or greater for which $\Lambda$ is not surjective. We also examine the kernel of the Lefschetz homomorphism, determining it for all groups when $p = 2$ and for groups with cyclic Sylow $p$-subgroups when $p$ is odd.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Erd\H{o}s-Straus conjecture, proposed in 1948 by Paul Erd\H{o}s and Ernst G. Straus, asks whether the Diophantine equation $$ \frac{4}{a} = \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} $$ admits positive integer solutions $b, c, d \in \mathbb{N}^*$ for every integer $a \geq 2$. While the conjecture has been confirmed for all even integers and for all integers congruent to $3 \pmod{4}$, the case $a \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ remains the central open challenge. In this work, we construct four explicit unbounded multivariable polynomials $p_1(x,y,z), p_2(x,y,z), p_3(x,y,z), p_4(x,y,z)$ with $x, y, z \geq 1$, such that each of the first three -- when inserted into the form $a = 4p_i(x,y,z)+1$ -- always produces values of $a$ for which the Erd\H{o}s--Straus equation admits an explicit solution. Thus, the first three polynomials individually satisfy the conjecture for all their outputs. We further conjecture that the values $$ 4p_1(x,y,z)+1,\quad 4p_2(x,y,z)+1,\quad 4p_3(x,y,z)+1,\quad 4p_4(x,y,z)+1 $$ collectively cover all integers congruent to $1 \pmod{4}$. Extensive computational verification up to $q = 10^9$ confirms that every integer of the form $4q+1$ within this range arises from at least one of these families. One of the polynomials alone generates all such prime values up to at least $1.2 \times 10^{10}$. These results offer strong computational evidence and explicit constructions relevant to the resolution of the conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The generalized Erd\H{o}s-Straus conjecture, proposed by Wac\l{}aw Sierpi\'{n}ski in 1956, asks whether the Diophantine equation $$ \frac{5}{a} = \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} $$ admits positive integer solutions $b,c,d \in \mathbb{N}$ for every integer $a \ge 2$. In this work we present explicit solutions for all integers $a \ge 2$. We begin with the simplest known cases where $a \equiv i \pmod{5}$ for $i \in \{0,2,3,4\}$, providing direct decompositions. The remaining open case, $a \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, is addressed for $a = 5q + 1$ with $q \not\equiv 0 \pmod{252}$, where we give explicit decompositions, often with $q$ expressed as three-variable polynomials. For $q \equiv 0 \pmod{252}$, we conjecture that a specific polynomial $p_{1}(x,y,z)=z (x (5 y-1)-y)-x,~ x,y,z \in \mathbb{N}^*$, which exactly satisfies the generalized Erd\H{o}s--Straus equation, generates all such multiples of $252$. This conjecture has been verified computationally for $5q+1$ up to approximately $10^{10}$, and the corresponding \textit{Mathematica} implementation is included.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a zero-relation algebra over a field $\mathcal K$, Crawley-Boevey introduced the concept of a tree module and provided a combinatorial description of a basis for the space of homomorphisms between two tree modules--the basis elements are called graph maps. The indecomposability of tree modules is essentially due to Gabriel. We relax a condition in the definition of a tree module to define generalised tree modules and when $\mathrm{char}(\mathcal K)\neq2$, under a certain condition, provide a combinatorial description of a finite generating set for the space of homomorphisms between two such modules--we call the generators generalised graph maps. As an application, we provide a sufficient condition for the (in)decomposability of certain generalised tree modules. We also show that all indecomposable modules over a Dynkin quiver of type $\mathbf D$ are isomorphic to generalised tree modules--this result also follows from a theorem of Ringel which states that all exceptional modules over the path algebra $\mathcal KQ$ of a finite quiver $Q$ are generalised tree modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study parabolic induction producing $\ell$-adic sheaves on a parahoric subgroup scheme in the loop group of a reductive group. Under a genericity assumption on the input data, we prove that it produces conjugation equivariant perverse sheaves on the parahoric subgroup; this is upgraded to a $t$-exact equivalence of categories of $\ell$-adic sheaves. An iterative version of the construction produces such a perverse sheaf starting from a geometric analogue of the data considered by J.-K. Yu and J. Kim. We prove, under a mild condition on $q$, that generic parabolic induction from a parahoric torus realizes the character of the representation arising from the associated parahoric Deligne--Lusztig induction, which is known to parametrize the Fintzen--Kaletha--Spice twist of types. In the simplest interesting setting, our construction produces a simple perverse sheaf associated to a sufficiently nontrivial multiplicative local system on a torus, resolving a conjecture of Lusztig.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study topological properties of moduli spaces of p-adic shtukas and local Shimura varieties. On one hand, we construct and study the specialization map for moduli spaces of p-adic shtukas at parahoric level whose target is an affine Deligne-Lusztig variety. On the other hand, given a p-adic shtuka datum $(G, b, \mu)$, with $G$ unramified over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and such that $(b, \mu)$ is HN-irreducible, we determine the set of geometric connected components of infinite level moduli spaces of p-adic shtukas. In other words, we understand $\pi_0(\mathrm{Sht}_{(G,b,\mu,\infty)} \times \mathrm{Spd} \mathbb{C}_p)$ with its right $G(\mathbb{Q}_p) \times G_b (\mathbb{Q}p ) \times W_E$ -action.

We derive an explicit asymptotic formula for the elliptic part when summing over $n<X$ with arbitrary smooth test functions at places in $S$ for the standard representation. As a consequence, we obtain the desired limit for the simple trace formula which only occurs in the ramified case. Moreover, we prove an asymptotic formula for the traces of Hecke operators on cusp forms with arbitrary level and weight $>2$, directly generalizing Altu\u{g}'s final result. Our approach differs entirely from Altu\u{g}'s: We apply a second Poisson summation with respect to the determinant, obtaining a formula on the Hitchin-Steinberg base $\mathfrak{g}/\!/ \mathsf{G}$. By changing variables from $(T, N)$ to $(T, \Delta)$ on $\mathfrak{g}/\!/ \mathsf{G}$, we perform analysis in the new coordinates.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A well-known problem in the theory of polynomials over finite fields is the characterization of minimal value set polynomials (MVSPs) over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $q = p^n$. These are the nonconstant polynomials $F \in \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ whose value set $V_F = \{F(a) : a \in \mathbb{F}_q\}$ has the smallest possible size, namely $\lceil \frac{q}{\deg(F)} \rceil$. In this paper, we describe the family $\mathcal{A}_q$ of all subsets $S \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q$ with $\# S>2$ that can be realized as the value set of an MVSP $F \in \mathbb{F}_q[x]$. Affine subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_q$ are a fundamental type of set in $\mathcal{A}_q$, and we provide the complete list of all MVSPs with such value sets. Building on this, we present a conjecture that characterizes all MVSPs $F \in \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ with $V_F=S$ for any $S \in \mathcal{A}_q$. The conjecture is confirmed by prior results for $q \in\left\{p, p^2, p^3\right\}$ or $\# S \geq p^{n / 2}$, and additional instances, including the cases for $q=p^4$ and $\# S>p^{n / 2-1}$, are proved. We further show that the conjecture leads to the complete characterization of the $\mathbb{F}_q$-Frobenius nonclassical curves of type $y^d=f(x)$, which we establish as a theorem for $q=p^4$.</p></details>

For the groups $G = \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{F}_q)$, these coincidences can be expressed very concretely in terms of the combinatorics of partitions, and the whole story recovers an avatar of the level-rank duality studied by Frenkel, Uglov, Chuang-Miyachi, and others.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix an integer $h \geq 2$, and let $b_1, \ldots, b_h$ be (not necessarily distinct) positive integers with $\gcd(b_1, \ldots, b_h) = 1$. For any subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, let $r_A(n)$ denote the number of solutions $(k_1, \ldots, k_h) \in A^h$ to the equation $$ b_1 k_1 + \cdots + b_h k_h = n. $$ Given a function $F$ satisfying $F(n) \leq r_{\mathbb{N}}(n)$, we ask: when does there exist a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that $r_A(n) \sim F(n)$? We prove that this is always possible when $F$ is regularly varying and satisfies $\lim_{n\to\infty} F(n)/\log n = \infty$. If one only requires $r_A(n) \asymp F(n)$, much weaker regularity conditions suffice: we show such a set $A$ exists for every increasing function $F$ satisfying $F(2x) \ll F(x)$ and either $$ \log x \ll F(x) \ll x^{\frac{1}{h-1}} \quad \text{or} \quad (\log x)^{2h^2} \ll F(x) \ll x^{h-1}. $$ Finally, we give a probabilistic heuristic supporting the following: if $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ satisfies $\limsup_{n\to\infty} r_A(n)/\log n < 1$, then $r_A(n) = 0$ for infinitely many $n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates the Auslander-Gorenstein property for monomial algebras. First, we prove that every Auslander-Gorenstein monomial algebra is a string algebra and present a simple combinatorial classification of Auslander-Gorenstein gentle algebras. Furthermore, we describe a procedure to transform any 2-Gorenstein monomial algebra into a Nakayama algebra, thereby reducing the classification of Auslander-Gorenstein monomial algebras to that of Auslander-Gorenstein Nakayama algebras. As an application of this reduction method, we prove that every monomial algebra satisfies a stronger version of the Auslander-Reiten Conjecture. Our second main result establishes that a monomial algebra is Auslander-Gorenstein if and only if it has a well-defined, bijective Auslander-Reiten map, confirming a conjecture of Marczinzik for monomial algebras. This yields a new homological characterisation of the Auslander-Gorenstein property. Additionally, we provide an explicit description of the Auslander-Reiten bijection in the case of gentle algebras. Along the way, we also generalise a result of Iwanaga and Fuller: We show that every $2n$-Gorenstein monomial algebra is also $(2n+1)$-Gorenstein for every $n\ge 1.$</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a new class of rings calling them {\it 2-UNJ rings}, which generalize the well-known 2-UJ, 2-UU and UNJ rings. Specifically, a ring $R$ is called 2-UNJ if, for every unit $u$ of $R$, the inclusion $u^2 \in 1 + Nil(R) + J(R)$ holds, where $Nil(R)$ is the set of nilpotent elements and $J(R)$ is the Jacobson radical of $R$. We show that every 2-UJ, 2-UU or UNJ ring is 2-UNJ, but the converse does {\it not} necessarily hold, and we also provide counter-examples to demonstrate this explicitly. We, moreover, investigate the connections between these rings and other algebraic properties such as being potent, tripotent, regular and exchange rings, respectively. In particular, we thoroughly study some natural extensions, like matrix rings and Morita contexts, obtaining new characterizations that were not addressed in previous works. Furthermore, we establish conditions under which group rings satisfy the 2-UNJ property. These results not only provide a better understanding of the structure of 2-UNJ rings, but also pave the way for future intensive research in this area.</p></details>

We show that this applies, in particular, to certain Deligne--Lusztig modules $\pi$. As an application, we prove that well-known character formulas for cuspidal representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_\ell)$ have modular analogs as statements about short exact sequences of lattices. We also prove modular analogs of character formulas for representations coming from higher-depth supercuspidal representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2$. The appendix by the authors and R.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We continue the study of extended Weyl groups $W$, which are reflection groups. Further we recall the definition of a hyperbolic cover of an extended Weyl group, and show that the hyperbolic covers of the extended Weyl groups are extended Coxeter groups, which had been introduced by Looijenga and discussed by people from different mathematical areas. More precisely the hyperbolic covers are the extended Coxeter groups of star type. We define simple reflections and Coxeter transformations in these groups, and show the transitivity of the Hurwitz action on the set of reduced reflection factorizations of a Coxeter transformation in the extended Coxeter groups of star type $\mathcal{W}$, where the reflections are the conjugates of the simple reflections in $\mathcal{W}$. We give two applications of our results. In the context of representation theory of algebras, we establish an isomorphism between the poset of thick subcategories that are generated by exceptional sequences of a hereditary connected ext-finite abelian $k$-category with a tilting object, $k$ algebraically closed of characteristic $0$, and the poset of elements in the extended Weyl group that are below a Coxeter transformation with respect to the absolute order. The second application concerns the theory of unimodal singularities. In particular, we provide an answer to a question of Brieskorn for the classical monodromy operator in the case of hyperbolic singularities.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We examine from an invariant theory viewpoint the monoid algebras for two monoids having large symmetry groups. The first monoid is the free left-regular band on $n$ letters, defined on the set of all injective words, that is, the words with at most one occurrence of each letter. This monoid carries the action of the symmetric group. The second monoid is one of its $q$-analogues, considered by K. Brown, carrying an action of the finite general linear group. In both cases, we show that the invariant subalgebras are semisimple commutative algebras, and characterize them using Stirling and $q$-Stirling numbers. We then use results from the theory of random walks and random-to-top shuffling to decompose the entire monoid algebra into irreducibles, simultaneously as a module over the invariant ring and as a group representation. Our irreducible decompositions are described in terms of derangement symmetric functions introduced by D\'esarm\'enien and Wachs.</p></details>

In fact the number $N(X)$ of exceptional gaps with $p_n \in [X,2X]$ is shown to be at most $O(X/\log^2 X)$. Assuming a form of the Hardy--Littlewood prime tuples conjecture, we establish a more precise asymptotic $N(X) \sim c X / \log^2 X$ for an explicit constant $c>0$, which we believe to be between $2.7$ and $2.8$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate a non-commutative version of strongly flat modules, which is based on the concept of universal localization introduced by Cohn. We consider a set $\sigma$ consisting of maps of finitely generated projective $R$-modules, where $R$ is not necessarily a commutative ring. Let $R_{\sigma}$ denote the universal localization of $R$ with respect to $\sigma$. The class of $\sigma$-strongly flat modules is defined as the left class in the cotorsion pair generated by $R_{\sigma}$. We examine the homotopy category of $\sigma$-strongly flat modules and demonstrate that the thick subcategory $\mathscr{S}_{\sigma}$, consisting of acyclic complexes, wherein all syzygies are $\sigma$-strongly flat, forms a precovering class within this homotopy category. This implies that the quotient map from $\mathbb{K}({\sigma\mbox{-}\mathcal{SF}})$ to $\mathbb{K}({\sigma\mbox{-}\mathcal{SF}})/\mathscr{S}_{\sigma}$ always has a fully faithful right adjoint.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A number $N$ is a triangular number if it can be written as $N = t(t + 1)/2$ for some nonnegative integer number $t$. A triangular number $N$ is called square if it is a perfect square, that is, $N = d^2$ for some integer number $d$. Square triangular numbers were characterized by Euler in 1778 and are in one-to-one correspondence with the so-called near-isosceles Pythagorean triples $(k,k+1,l)$, where $k^2 + (k+1)^2 = l^2$. A quadratic number is the product $\Pi = \Pi(k,j) = k(k+1)(k+j)(k+j+1)$ for some nonnegative integer numbers $k$ and $j$. By definition, it is the product of two triangular numbers and 4. Quadratic number $\Pi$ and the corresponding pair $(k,j)$ are called square if $\Pi$ is a perfect square. Clearly, $(k,j)$ is square if both triangular numbers $k(k+1)/2$ and $(k+j)(k+j+1)/2$ are perfect squares. Yet, there exist infinitely many other square quadratic numbers. We construct polynomials $j_i(k)$ of degree $i$ with positive integer coefficients satisfying equations: $k + j_{2 \ell}(k) + 1 = k [a_\ell k^\ell + \dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 +1 = (k+1) [b_\ell k^\ell + \dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ and \newline $k + j_{2\ell+1}(k) + 1 = k(k+1) [a_\ell k^\ell + \dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 + 1 = [b_{\ell+1} k^{\ell+1}+b_\ell k^\ell + \dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ for some positive integer $\ell$ and some coefficients $a_i, b_j$, $i=0, \ldots, \ell, j=0, \ldots, \ell+1$. All the obtained pairs $(k, j_i(k))$ are square. We conjecture that the products of square triangular numbers and pairs $(k, j_i(k))$ cover all quadratic squares. Additionally, we identify pairs of intervals of successive integers with equal sums of squares.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent article on overpartitions, Merca considered the auxiliary function $a(n)$ which counts the number of partitions of $n$ where odd parts are repeated at most twice (and there are no restrictions on the even parts). In the course of his work, Merca proved the following: For all $n\geq 0$, \begin{align*} a(4n+2) &\equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \textrm{\ \ and} \\ a(4n+3) &\equiv 0 \pmod{2}. \end{align*} Merca then indicates that a classical proof of these congruences would be very interesting. The goal of this short note is to fulfill Merca's request by providing two truly elementary (classical) proofs of these congruences.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a finite group, let $x\in G$ and let $p$ be a prime. We prove that the commutator $[x,g]$ is a $p$-element for every $g\in G$ if and only if $x$ is central modulo $O_p(G),$ where $O_p(G)$ denotes the largest normal $p$-subgroup of $G$. This result simultaneously generalizes some variants of both the Baer-Suzuki theorem and Glauberman's $Z_p^*$-theorem. Furthermore, we show that if $x\in G$ is a $p$-element and there exists an integer $m\ge 1$ such that for all $g\in G$, either $[x,g]=1$ or the order of $[x,g] $ is $m$ for every $g\in G$, then the subgroup generated by the conjugacy class of $G$ containing $x$ is solvable. As an application, we confirm a conjecture of Beltr\'an, Felipe and Melchor, which states that if $K$ is a conjugacy class of $G$ such that the product $K^{-1}K=1\cup D\cup D^{-1}$ for some conjugacy class $D$ of $G$, then the subgroup generated by $K$ is solvable.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $L$ be a field of positive characteristic $p$ with a fixed algebraic closure $\overline{L}$, and let $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta\in L$. For an integer $d\ge 2$, we consider the family of polynomials $f_{\lambda}(z) := z^d+\lambda$, parameterized by $\lambda\in\overline{L}$. Define $C(\alpha_1,\alpha_2;\beta)$ to be the set of all $\lambda\in\overline{L}$ for which there exist $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $f_{\lambda}^m(\alpha_1)=f_{\lambda}^n(\alpha_2)=\beta$. In other words, $C(\alpha_1,\alpha_2;\beta)$ consists of all $\lambda\in\overline{L}$ with the property that the orbit of $\alpha_1$ collides with the orbit of $\alpha_2$ under the same polynomial $f_{\lambda}$ precisely at the point $\beta$. Assuming $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta$ are not all contained in a finite subfield of $L$, we provide explicit necessary and sufficient conditions under which $C(\alpha_1,\alpha_2;\beta)$ is infinite. We also discuss the remaining case where $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta\in \overline{\mathbb F}_p$ and provide ample computational data that suggest a somewhat surprising conjecture. Our problem fits into a long series of questions in the area of unlikely intersections in arithmetic dynamics, which have been primarily studied over fields of characteristic $0$. Working in characteristic $p$ adds significant difficulties, but also reveals the subtlety of our problem, especially when some of the points lie in a finite field or when $d$ is a power of $p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the 3-category $2\mathfrak{C}at$ whose objects are 2-categories, 1-morphisms are lax functors, 2-morphisms are lax transformations and 3-morphisms are modifications. The aim is to show that it carries interesting representation-theoretic information. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a small 1-category and $\mathfrak{B}im_k$ be the 2-category of bimodules over $k$-algebras, where $k$ is a commutative ring with identity. We call a covariant (resp. contravariant) pseudofunctor from $\mathcal{C}$ into $\mathfrak{B}im_k$ a modulation (resp. comodulation) on $\mathcal{C}$, define and study its representations. This framework provides a unified approach to investigate 2-representations of finite groups, modulated quivers and their representations, as well as presheaves of $k$-algebras and their modules. Moreover, several key constructions are natural ingredients in $2\mathfrak{C}at$, and thus it exhibits an interesting application of higher category theory to representation theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate races among prime ideals in number fields when there are two or more competing conjugacy classes. In their work [4], Fiorilli and Jouve studied two-way races in number fields and showed that-unlike the classical setting of primes in arithmetic progressions-these biases can approach the extreme values of 0 and 1. They also identified when these biases tend toward one-half (as the degree of the extension grows), which we call ''moderate biases'' because that behavior mirrors the classical case. In this paper, we extend their analysis to races with r competing conjugacy classes (rway races) and precisely study the cases where these biases are moderate (meaning they tend to 1/r! as the discriminant of the extension grows). Our first main result is an explicit formula for the bias in any r-way race (for all r $\ge$ 2), generalizing the two-way formula of Fiorilli and Jouve [4] and Lamzouri's r-way expression in the classical case of residue classes modulo q [12], under the same hypotheses. Using this formula, we give a criterion characterizing completely, in the abelian case, r-moderate races. Surprisingly, once r $\ge$ 3 this criterion is independent of r, making the two-way race exceptional. We also construct families of number fields exhibiting such moderacy, we prove density results for the values of logarithmic densities and exhibit different behaviors of those densities between the cases r = 3 and r $\ge$ 4.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a field $F=\mathbb{F}_q((t))$ splitting over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q((t))$. Following [KV,DR], a tamely unramified Langlands parameter $\lambda:W_F\to{}^L G(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\ell})$ in general position gives rise to a finite set $\Pi_{\lambda}$ of irreducible admissible representations of $G(F)$, called the $L$-packet. The main goal of this work is to provide a geometric description of characters $\chi_{\pi}$ of $\pi\in\Pi_{\lambda}$ and of their endoscopic linear combinations $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ in terms of homology of affine Springer fibers, thus establishing an analog of Lusztig conjectures in this case. Furthermore, each $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ can be described as the trace of Frobenius function of a conjugation equivariant perverse sheaf on the loop group by the sheaf-function correspondence. As another application, we prove that the sum $\chi_{\lambda}^{st}:=\sum_{\pi\in\Pi_{\lambda}}\chi_{\pi}$ is stable and show that the $\chi_{\lambda}^{st}$'s are compatible with inner twistings. More generally, we prove that each $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ is $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda,\kappa}$-stable.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A new homological dimension, called the Igusa-Todorov distance, is introduced to measure how far an Artin algebra is from being an Igusa-Todorov algebra. An upper bound for the dimension is established in terms of the Loewy length, leading to the conclusion that every Artin algebra has a finite Igusa-Todorov distance.Using this dimension, we derive an upper bound for the dimension of the singularity category. Furthermore, we investigate how the Igusa-Todorov distance behaves under various relationships between algebras. Specifically, we demonstrate that stable equivalences preserve the Igusa-Todorov distances for algebras without nodes, prove that it is an invariant under singular equivalence of Morita type with level, and establish bounds for the distances of algebras involved in a recollement of derived module categories. Consequently, the Igusa-Todorov distance is an invariant under derived equivalences of algebras.</p></details>

In this paper, we study the Gross-Kudla-Schoen modified diagonal 1-cycles of these curves. We prove that if $p \ge 3$ is a prime, then for every $\lambda$ the Griffiths Abel-Jacobi image of the modified diagonal cycle of $X_{p,\lambda}$ is nontrivial for every cuspidal choice of a base point. On the other hand, we show that the modified diagonal cycle and hence the Ceresa cycle of $X_{3,\lambda}$ is torsion in the Chow group for every $\lambda$ and every choice of a base point.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The well-known Hardy--Ramanujan inequality states that if $\omega(n)$ denotes the number of distinct prime factors of a positive integer $n$, then there is an absolute constant $C>0$ such that uniformly for $x\ge2$ and $k\in\mathbb{N}$, $$\#\{n\le x\colon\omega(n)=k\}\ll\frac{x(\log\log x+C)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!\log x}.$$ A myriad of generalizations and variations of this inequality have been discovered. In this paper, we establish a weighted version of this inequality for sifted sets, which generalizes an earlier result of Hal\'asz and implies Timofeev's theorems on shifted primes. We then explore its applications to a variety of intriguing problems, such as large deviations of $\omega$ on subsets of integers, the Erd\H{o}s multiplication table problem, divisors of shifted primes, and the image of the Carmichael $\lambda$-function. Building on the same circle of ideas, we also generalize Troupe's result on the normal order of $\omega(s(n))$ for the sum-of-proper-divisors function $s(n)$, confirming for the first time the weighted version of a special case of a 1992 conjecture by Erd\H{o}s, Granville, Pomerance, and Spiro.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 34 pages. Modified the definition of small support, revised the statement about dissonant spectra

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We extend the support theory of Benson--Iyengar--Krause to the non-Noetherian setting by introducing a new notion of small support for modules. This enables us to prove that the stable module category of a finite group is canonically stratified by the action of the Tate cohomology ring, despite the fact that this ring is rarely Noetherian. In the tensor triangular context, we compare the support theory proposed by W. Sanders (which extends the Balmer--Favi support theory beyond the weakly Noetherian setting) with our generalized BIK support theory. When the Balmer spectrum is homeomorphic to the Zariski spectrum of the endomorphism ring of the unit, the two support theories coincide as do their associated theories of stratification. We also prove a negative result which states that the Balmer--Favi--Sanders support theory can only stratify categories whose spectra are weakly Noetherian. This provides additional justification for the weakly Noetherian hypothesis in the work of Barthel, Heard and B. Sanders. On the other hand, the detection property and the local-to-global principle remain interesting in the general setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Accuracy in neural PDE solvers often breaks down not because of limited expressivity, but due to poor optimisation caused by ill-conditioning, especially in multi-fidelity and stiff problems. We study this issue in Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machines (PIELMs), a convex variant of neural PDE solvers, and show that asymptotic components in governing equations can produce highly ill-conditioned activation matrices, severely limiting convergence. We introduce Shifted Gaussian Encoding, a simple yet effective activation filtering step that increases matrix rank and expressivity while preserving convexity. Our method extends the solvable range of Peclet numbers in steady advection-diffusion equations by over two orders of magnitude, achieves up to six orders lower error on multi-frequency function learning, and fits high-fidelity image vectors more accurately and faster than deep networks with over a million parameters. This work highlights that conditioning, not depth, is often the bottleneck in scientific neural solvers and that simple architectural changes can unlock substantial gains.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish special value results of convolutions of Goss and Pellarin $L$-series attached to Drinfeld modules that take values in Tate algebras. Applying the class module formula of Demeslay to certain rigid analytic twists of one Drinfeld module by another, we extend the special value formula for the Pellarin $L$-function associated to the Carlitz module and the Anderson-Thakur function to Drinfeld modules of arbitrary rank and their rigid analytic trivializations. By way of the theory of Schur polynomials these identities take the form of specializations of convolutions of Rankin-Selberg type. These convolution $L$-series are also identified with covolumes of Stark units.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently Amdeberhan, Sellers, and Singh introduced a new infinite family of partition functions called generalized cubic partitions. Given a positive integer $d$, they let $a_d(n)$ be the counting function for partitions of $n$ in which the odd parts are unrestricted and the even parts are $d$-colored. These partitions are natural generalizations of Chan's notion of cubic partitions, as they coincide when $d=2.$ Many Ramanujan-like congruences exist in the literature for cubic partitions, and in their work Amdeberhan, Sellers, and Singh proved a collection of congruences satisfied by $a_d(n)$ for various $d \geq 1$, including an infinite family with prime moduli. Our goal in this paper is to prove a family of congruences modulo powers of 5 for $a_3(n)$. More specifically, our main theorem asserts $$a_3\left(5^{2\alpha}n +\gamma_{\alpha} \right) \equiv 0 \pmod{5^\alpha},$$ where $$\gamma_{\alpha} = 20 + \frac{19 \cdot 25 (25^{\alpha-1}-1)}{24}.$$ In order to prove these congruences, we use an approach centered around modular functions, as in the seminal work of Watson and Atkin on proving Ramanujan's congruences for the partition function $p(n)$. However, due to the complexity of the modular curve $X_0(10)$ associated to our modular functions, the classical method cannot be directly applied. Rather, we utilize the very recently developed localization method of Banerjee and Smoot, which is designed to treat congruence families over more complicated modular curves, such as $X_0(10).$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an $S$-valued function $f$ of $m \geq 1$ variables we define a dynamical process in which the output $f(\overline{v})$ replaces exactly one entry of the input $\overline{v} \in S^m$ at each step in the iterative process. Our study focuses on periodic vectors with respect to this process. We define a stratification of periodic vectors according to their type, and characterize types for which the determination of periodic vectors comes down to dynamics of univariate polynomials. We then restrict to the case of a diagonal binary quadratic form $f$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, and classify rational periodic vectors for all types of period up to $5$. This includes two types which do not arise from the univariate case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a function field of a curve in characteristic zero or a number field over which the $abc$-conjecture holds, fix $\alpha\in K$, and let $f_{d,c}(x)=x^d+c$ for some $d\geq2$ and some $c\in K$. Then for many $c$ and $d$, we prove that $f_{d,c}^n(x)-\alpha$ has at most $d$ factors in $K[x]$ for all $n\geq1$. For example, when $\alpha=0$ we prove that the set $$\Big\{d\,:\, f_{d,c}^n(x)\;\text{has at most $d$ factors in $K[x]$ for all $n\geq1$ and all $h(c)>0$}\Big\}$$ has positive asymptotic density. We then apply this result to compute the density of prime divisors in certain forward orbits and to establish the finiteness of integral points in certain backward orbits.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a new systematic method for evaluating generalized log-sine integrals in terms of polylogarithms. Our approach is based on an identity connecting ordinary generating functions of polylogarithms to integrals involving the sine function. This method provides closed-form expressions for log-sine integrals of weight up to 4 using only classical polylogarithms, while higher weights require Nielsen polylogarithms. Later we generalize this identity and show how it gives rise to numerous Ap\'ery-like formulae extending results of Koecher, Leshchiner and others. We also derive hyperbolic analogues and recover several functional equations between Nielsen polylogarithms. In the process, we derive new parametric identities similar to those given by Saha and Sinha.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over a number field $k$. The Green--Griffiths--Lang conjecture relates the question of finiteness of rational points in $X$ to the triviality of rational maps from abelian varieties to $X$ and to complex hyperbolicity. Here we investigate the phenomenon of sparsity of rational points in $X$ -- roughly speaking, when there are very few rational points if counted ordered by height. We are interested in the case when sparsity holds over every finite extension of $k$, in which case we say that the variety is \emph{xeric}. We initiate a systematic study of the relation of this property with the non-existence of rational curves in $X$ as well as with certain notion of $p$-adic hyperbolicity.</p></details>
