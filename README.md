### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19804v1'>2510.19804</a>\]&nbsp; **Forbidden Sidon subsets of perfect difference sets, featuring a human-assisted proof**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Boris Alexeev, Dustin G. Mixon &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We resolve a $1000 Erd\H{o}s prize problem, complete with formal verification generated by a large language model. In over a dozen papers, beginning in 1976 and spanning two decades, Paul Erd\H{o}s repeatedly posed one of his "favourite" conjectures: every finite Sidon set can be extended to a finite perfect difference set. We establish that {1, 2, 4, 8, 13} is a counterexample to this conjecture. During the preparation of this paper, we discovered that although this problem was presumed to be open for half a century, Marshall Hall, Jr. published a different counterexample three decades before Erd\H{o}s first posed the problem. With a healthy skepticism of this apparent oversight, and out of an abundance of caution, we used ChatGPT to vibe code a Lean proof of both Hall's and our counterexamples.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19740v1'>2510.19740</a>\]&nbsp; **A central limit theorem for partitions involving generalised divisor function**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Madhuparna Das, Nicolas Robles &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define an $f$-restricted partition $p_f(n,k)$ of fixed length $k$ given by the bivariate generating series \begin{align*} Q_f(z,u) \coloneqq 1+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} p_f(n,k) u^kz^n =\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}(1+uz^k)^{\Delta_f(k)}, \end{align*} where $\Delta_f(n)=f(n+1)-f(n)$. In this article, we establish a central limit theorem for the number of summands in such partitions when $f(n)=\sigma_r(n)$ denotes the generalised divisor function, defined as $\sigma_r(n)=\sum_{d|n}d^r$ for integer $r\geq 2$. This can be considered as a generalisation of the work of Lipnik, Madritsch, and Tichy, who previously studied this problem for $f(n)=\lfloor{n}^{\alpha}\rfloor$ with $0<\alpha<1$. A key element of our proof relies on the analytic behaviour of the Dirichlet series \begin{align*} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sigma_r(n+1)}{n^s}, \end{align*} for $\mathrm{Re}(s)>1$. We study this problem employing the identity involving the Ramanujan sum. Furthermore, we analyse the Euler product arising from the above Dirichlet series by adopting the argument of Alkan, Ledoan and Zaharescu.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Stijn Cambie, Wouter van Doorn &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 5 Pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Erd\H{o}s and Hall defined a pair $(m, n)$ of positive integers to be interlocking, if between any pair of consecutive divisors (both larger than $1$) of $n$ (resp. $m$) there is a divisor of $m$ (resp. $n$). A positive integer is said to be separable if it belongs to an interlocking pair. We prove that the lower density of separable powers of two is positive, as well as the lower density of powers of two which are not separable. Finally, we prove that the number of interlocking pairs whose product is equal to the product of the first primes, is finite. We hereby resolve two conjectures by Erd\H{o}s and Hall.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19703v1'>2510.19703</a>\]&nbsp; **Identifying the simple finite-dimensional Lie algebras over C by means of simple sequences**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kai Neergård &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math-ph &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A novel method of determining which Dynkin diagrams represent simple finite-dimensional Lie algebras over C is presented. It is based on a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a suitably defined Cartan matrix to be expressible by scalar products in a Euclidean vector space. The sufficiency of this condition makes unnecessary subsequent verification of the existence of a Lie algebra or root system corresponding to each Dynkin diagram by explicit construction. The Dynkin diagrams are selected by examination of an easily calculated sequence of minors of a symmetrised Cartan matrix. These minors are mostly integers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this third part in this series we continue from \cite{papaspadicpart1}, the study of relations among values of G-functions associated to a $1$-parameter family of principally polarized abelian surfaces. In particular, we establish relations among the values of these G-functions, in both the archimedean and $p$-adic setting, at points corresponding to abelian surfaces with Quaternionic multiplication. We also discuss applications to the Zilber-Pink conjecture in $\mathcal{A}_2$ that naturally follow from our discussion.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 29 pages, 4 figures, new version after referee's suggestions : changes in the presentation of section 4, appendix added to present pari/gp codes to check for the vanishing at the central point

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by questions of Fouvry and Rudnick on the distribution of Gaussian primes, we develop a very general setting in which one can study inequities in the distribution of analogues of primes through analytic properties of infinitely many $L$-functions. In particular, we give a heuristic argument for the following claim : for more than half of the prime numbers that can be written as a sum of two square, the odd square is the square of a positive integer congruent to $1 \bmod 4$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 140 pages (reformatted); v4; final version, to appear in Mem. Am. Math. Soc

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Starting with a k-linear or DG category admitting a (homotopy) Serre functor, we construct a k-linear or DG 2-category categorifying the Heisenberg algebra of the numerical K-group of the original category. We also define a 2-categorical analogue of the Fock space representation of the Heisenberg algebra. Our construction generalises and unifies various categorical Heisenberg algebra actions appearing in the literature. In particular, we give a full categorical enhancement of the action on derived categories of symmetric quotient stacks introduced by Krug, which itself categorifies a Heisenberg algebra action proposed by Grojnowski.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 6 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The recent negative answer to Hilbert's tenth problem over rings of integers relies on a theorem that for every extension of number fields $L/K$, if there is an abelian variety $A$ over $K$ such that $0 < \mathrm{rank} A(K) = \mathrm{rank} A(L)$, then $\mathcal{O}_K$ is $\mathcal{O}_L$-diophantine. We present an alternative proof of this theorem and review how it is used.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00646v4'>2410.00646</a>\]&nbsp; **Fourth power moment of twisted Kloosterman sum and Hurwitz class numbers**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Neelam Saikia &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Change in the title of the paper

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the fourth power moment of twisted Kloosterman sum and its relationship with Hurwitz class number. We derive an explicit formula expressing this moment in terms of weighted sums involving Hurwitz class numbers. Our approach involves analyzing point counting formulas associated with the resolution of certain Calabi-Yau threefold. Furthermore, we study the asymptotic behaviour of weighted sums of Hurwitz class numbers that appear in the moment formula. To derive these asymptotic formulas, we employ the theory of harmonic Maass forms, mock modular forms and holomorphic projections. As an application of these asymptotic results, we obtain the asymptotic formula for the fourth power moment of twisted Kloosterman sums.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We connect the existence of a ternary classical universal quadratic form over a totally real number field $K$ with the property that all totally positive multiples of 2 are sums of squares (if $K$ does not contain $\sqrt 2$ or contains a nonsquare totally positive unit). In particular, we get that Kitaoka's Conjecture holds for all fields of odd discriminant.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14389v2'>2306.14389</a>\]&nbsp; **Higher Dimer Covers on Snake Graphs**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gregg Musiker, Nicholas Ovenhouse, Ralf Schiffler, Sylvester W. Zhang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 31 pages, comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Snake graphs are a class of planar graphs that are important in the theory of cluster algebras. Indeed, the Laurent expansions of the cluster variables in cluster algebras from surfaces are given as weight generating functions for 1-dimer covers (or perfect matchings) of snake graphs. Moreover, the enumeration of 1-dimer covers of snake graphs provides a combinatorial interpretation of continued fractions. In particular, the number of 1-dimer covers of the snake graph $\mathscr{G}[a_1,\dots,a_n]$ is the numerator of the continued fraction $[a_1,\dots,a_n]$. This number is equal to the top left entry of the matrix product $\left(\begin{smallmatrix} a_1&1\\1&0 \end{smallmatrix}\right) \cdots \left(\begin{smallmatrix} a_n&1\\1&0 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$. In this paper, we give enumerative results on $m$-dimer covers of snake graphs. We show that the number of $m$-dimer covers of the snake graph $\mathscr{G}[a_1,\ldots,a_n]$ is the top left entry of a product of analogous $(m+1)$-by-$(m+1)$ matrices. We discuss how our enumerative results are related to other known combinatorial formulas, and we suggest a generalization of continued fractions based on our methods. These generalized continued fractions provide some interesting open questions and a possibly novel approach towards Hermite's problem for cubic irrationals.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 27 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The ongoing progress in quantum technologies has fueled a sustained exploration of their potential applications across various domains. One particularly promising field is quantitative finance, where a central challenge is the pricing of financial derivatives-traditionally addressed through Monte Carlo integration techniques. In this work, we introduce two hybrid classical-quantum methods to address the option pricing problem. These approaches rely on reconstructing Fourier series representations of statistical distributions from the outputs of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models based on Parametrized Quantum Circuits (PQCs). We analyze the impact of data size and PQC dimensionality on performance. Quantum Accelerated Monte Carlo (QAMC) is employed as a benchmark to quantitatively assess the proposed models in terms of computational cost and accuracy in the extraction of Fourier coefficients. Through the numerical experiments, we show that the proposed methods achieve remarkable accuracy, becoming a competitive quantum alternative for derivatives valuation.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Work is done during ANU-FRT program 2025

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct an action of the braid group on the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on hypertoric varieties arising from hyperplane arrangements. Using wall-crossing equivalences associated to paths in the complexified complement of the hyperplane arrangement, we show that these equivalences under certain conditions yield a functor from the Deligne groupoid to the category of triangulated equivalences. This gives rise to a canonical representation of the fundamental group, which recovers the braid group, acting on $D^b(\mathfrak{M}_{\eta})$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages. We welcome any constructive discussions and comments

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the rank-4 case of the conjecture of Ha-Hai-Nghia for the invariant subspace of the truncated polynomial ring $\mathcal{Q}_m(n)=\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dots,x_n]/(x_1^{q^m},\dots,x_n^{q^m}),$ under a new, explicit technical hypothesis. Our argument extends the determinant calculus for the delta operator by deriving crucial rank-4 identities governing its interaction with the Dickson algebra. We show that the proof of the conjecture reduces to a specific vanishing property, for which we introduce a sufficient condition, the "matching hypothesis" ($\mathrm{H_{match}}$), relating the degree structures of Dickson invariants. This condition is justified by theoretical arguments and verified computationally in many cases. Combining this approach with the normalized derivation approach from our prior work, we establish the conjecture. As a result, the Lewis-Reiner-Stanton Conjecture is also confirmed for rank four under the given hypothesis.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Steven Robertson, Noy Soffer Aranov &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 92 pages, 45 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is the first of a pair of papers, whose collective goal is to disprove a conjecture of Kemarsky, Paulin, and Shapira (KPS) on the escape of mass of Laurent series. This paper lays the foundations on which its sibling builds. In particular, the $p$-Cantor sequence is introduced. This generalises the classical Cantor sequence into a $p$-automatic sequence for any odd prime $p$. Two main results are then established, both of which play a key role in the disproof of the KPS conjecture. First, the two-dimensional sequence comprised of the Toeplitz determinants of the $p$-Cantor sequence over $\mathbb{F}_p$ is extensively studied. Indeed, the so-called profile of this sequence (which encodes the zero regions) is shown to be [p,p]-automatic. In the process of deriving this, the theory of so-called number walls is developed greatly. Many of these results are stated in full generality, as the authors expect them to be useful when tackling similar problems going forward. Secondly, a natural process is described that converts number wall of an automatic sequence into a unique fractal. When this sequence is the aforementioned $p$-Cantor sequence, this fractal is shown to have Hausdorff dimension $\log((p^2+1)/2)/\log(p).$</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Noy Soffer Aranov, Steven Robertson &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime. In 2017, Kemarsky, Paulin, and Shapira (KPS) conjectured that any Laurent series over $\mathbb{F}_p$ exhibits full escape of mass with respect to any irreducible polynomial $P(t)\in\mathbb{F}_p[t]$. In 2025, this was shown to be false in the case $p=2$ and $P(t)=t$ by Nesharim, Shapira and the first named author. This work shows that for any odd prime $p$ and any irreducible polynomial $P(t)\in\mathbb{F}_p[t]$, the so-called $p$-Cantor sequence provides a counterexample to the aforementioned conjecture over $\mathbb{F}_p$. Furthermore, the concepts of maximal escape of mass and generic escape of mass are introduced. These lead to two natural variations of the KPS conjecture, both of which are shown to hold for all previous counterexamples.</p></details>

> **Comment:** to appear in "The Landscape of Commutative Algebra", editors M. Rossi, N.V. Trung, B. Ulrich, and J. Verma, Lecture Note Series of the London Mathematical Society, Cambridge University Press

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We extend the theory of $p$-fractals of Monsky and Teixeira by introducing the notion of weak $p$-fractal. We prove that for a hypersurface $f$ having rational Hilbert-Kunz series is equivalent to the weak $p$-fractality of the associated function $\phi_{f,p}$ and having rational F-signature series is equivalent to the weak $p$-fractality of the reflection $\overline{\phi}_{f,p}$. In addition, we prove some results characterizing the shape of the generating series of numerical functions which are quasi-polynomials in $p^n$. This is motivated by the fact that the Hilbert-Kunz and F-signature functions take this form in several examples of interest.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Survey, 16 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The seminal paper "J.T. Stafford, Module structure of Weyl algebras, J. London Math. Soc. (2) 18 (1978), no. 3, 429--442" was a major step forward in our understanding of Weyl algebras. Beginning with Serre's Theorem on free summands of projective modules and Bass' Stable Range Theorem in commutative algebra, we attempt to trace the origins of this work and explain how it led to Stafford's construction of non-holonomic simple modules over Weyl algebras. We also describe Bernstein-Lunt's geometric construction of infinite families of non-holonomic simple modules. We recall more recent developments related to Weyl algebras, especially that of parametrizing right ideals in the first Weyl algebra and its relation to Calogero-Moser spaces. Finally, we revisit Stafford's results in the context of quantized symplectic singularities, where they lead naturally to open problems on the behaviour of simple modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $p \geqslant 3$ and an unramified extension $F/\mathbb{Q}_p$ with perfect residue field, we define a syntomic complex with coefficients in a Wach module over a certain period ring for $F$. We show that our complex computes the crystalline part of the Galois cohomology (in the sense of Bloch and Kato) of the associated crystalline representation of the absolute Galois group of $F$. Furthermore, we establish that Wach modules of Berger naturally descend over to a smaller period ring studied by Fontaine and Wach. This enables us to define another syntomic complex with coefficients, and we show that its cohomology also computes the crystalline part of the Galois cohomology of the associated representation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a construction of eventually periodic projective resolutions for modules of type $\textbf{FP}_{\infty}$ over the integral group rings of $\Gamma = G / (c)$ of type $\textbf{VFP}$, with $G$ of type $\textbf{FP}$ and $c$ a central element. Our approach also applies more generally to quotients of rings of finite left global dimension by a regular central element. It utilises a construction of Shamash, combined with the iterated mapping cone technique, to systematically `purge' homology from a complex. We demonstrate the computability of our method through explicit calculations for several families of groups including hyperbolic triangle groups and mapping class groups of the punctured plane.</p></details>

> **Comment:** For the Academy of Romanian Scientists

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A conjecture by Sun states that the partition function $p(n)$, for $n>1$, is never a perfect power. Recent work by Merca et al. proposes generalizations of perfect-power repulsion for $p(n)$. In this note, we prove these generalizations for the functions $p_B(n)$, which count the number of partitions of $n$ with the largest part $\leq B$. If $B\geq 4$ and $k\geq 3$, with $k\nmid (B-1)$, then we prove that there are only finitely many pairs $(n,m)$ for which $$\lvert p_B(n)-m^k\rvert\le d.$$ These results support Sun and Merca et al.'s conjectures, as $p_B(n) \rightarrow p(n)$ when $B \rightarrow +\infty.$ To prove this, we reduce the problem to Siegel's Theorem, which guarantees the finiteness of integral points on curves with genus $\geq 1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Zeckendorf's Theorem says that for all $k \geq 3$, every nonnegative integer has a unique $k$-Zeckendorf representation as a sum of distinct $k$-bonacci numbers, where no $k$ consecutive $k$-bonacci numbers are present in the representation. Anderson and Bicknell-Johnson extend this result to the multidimensional context: letting the $k$-bonacci vectors $\vec{\mathbf{X}}_i \in \mathbb{Z}^{k-1}$ be given by $\vec{\mathbf{X}}_0=\vec{\mathbf{0}}$, $\vec{\mathbf{X}}_{-i}=\vec{\mathbf{e}}_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq k-1$, and $\vec{\mathbf{X}}_n=\sum_{i=1}^k \vec{\mathbf{X}}_{n-i}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, they show that for all $k \geq 3$, every $\vec{\mathbf{v}} \in \mathbb{Z}^{k-1}$ has a unique $k$-bonacci vector Zeckendorf representation, a sum of distinct $k$-bonacci vectors where no $k$ consecutive $k$-bonacci vectors are present in the representation. Their proof provides an inductive algorithm for finding such representations. We present two improved algorithms for finding the $k$-bonacci vector Zeckendorf representation of $\vec{\mathbf{v}}$ and analyze their relative efficiency. We utilize a projection map $S_n:\mathbb Z^{k-1} \to \mathbb Z_{\geq 0}$, introduced in Anderson and Bicknell-Johnson work, that reduces the study of $k$-bonacci vector representations to the setting of $k$-bonacci number representations, provided a lower bound is established for the most negatively indexed $k$-bonacci vector present in the $k$-bonacci vector Zeckendorf representation of $\vec{\mathbf{v}}$. Using this map and a bijection between $\mathbb Z^{k-1}$ and $\mathbb Z_{\geq 0}$, we further show that the number of and gaps between summands in $k$-bonacci vector Zeckendorf representations exhibit the same properties as those in $k$-Zeckendorf representations and that $k$-bonacci vector Zeckendorf representations exhibit summand minimality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present an algorithm that, for every fixed degree $n\ge 3$, will enumerate all degree-$n$ places of the projective line over a finite field $k$ up to the natural action of $\mathrm{PGL}_2(k)$ using $O(\log q)$ space and $\widetilde{O}(q^{n-3})$ time, where $q=\#k$. Since there are $\Theta(q^{n-3})$orbits of $\mathrm{PGL}_2(k)$ acting on the set of degree-$n$ places, the algorithm is quasilinear in the size of its output. The algorithm is probabilistic unless we assume the extended Riemann hypothesis. We also present an algorithm for enumerating orbit representatives for the action of $\mathrm{PGL}_2(k)$ on the degree-$n$ effective divisors of $\mathbf{P}^1$ over finite fields $k$. The two algorithms depend on one another; our method of enumerating orbits of places of odd degree $n$ depends on enumerating orbits of effective divisors of degree $(n+1)/2$. As an application of the second algorithm, for $g=2$, $3$, and $4$ we implement an algorithm in Magma that computes all hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ over finite fields $k$ using $O(q^{g-1})$ space and $\widetilde{O}(q^{2g-1})$ time, where $q=\#k$. Our implementation runs $60$--$80$ times faster than existing algorithms for computing genus-$2$ hyperelliptic curves, and about $280$ times faster than existing algorithms for computing genus-$3$ hyperelliptic curves. We know of no other implementations of algorithms to compute genus-$4$ hyperelliptic curves.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A = a_0T^m + \sum_{j=1}^{m-1} a_j (T^{m-j}+T^{m+j}) + T^{2m}+1 \in \mathbf{Z}[T]$ be a monic reciprocal polynomial of degree $2m$ sampled randomly by selecting its coefficients $a_0,a_1,\dots,a_{m-1}$ independently according to a given probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbf{Z}$. For a wide range of measures $\mu$, we prove that $A$ is irreducible with probability $\ge 1-Cm^{-c}$ for some absolute constants $c,C>0$. In addition, we prove that with the same probability the Galois group of $A$ is either the full hyperoctahedral group $\mathcal{C}_2 \wr \mathcal{S}_m$ or one of two of its index-$2$ subgroups. The main condition that $\mu$ must satisfy is of Fourier-theoretic nature, and holds for example when $\mu$ is the uniform measure on a set of at least $35$ consecutive integers, or on an arbitrary, sufficiently large subset of an interval $[-H,H]$, with $H$ larger than some absolute constant. Our most general result allows for each $a_j$ to be sampled by its own probability measure $\mu_j$. Our approach builds on earlier work of Bary-Soroker, Kozma and the second author, who proved for essentially the same $\mu_j$ that the 'standard' monic polynomial $a_0 + \cdots + a_{m-1}T^{m-1} + T^m$ is irreducible and has as Galois group either the symmetric group $\mathcal{S}_m$ or the alternating group $\mathcal{A}_m$ with high probability, conditioning on $a_0 \neq 0$. In our setting of reciprocal polynomials, we can rule out (all subgroups of) the maximal alternating subgroup $(\mathcal{C}_2 \wr \mathcal{S}_m) \cap \mathcal{A}_{2m}$ of the hyperoctahedral group as likely Galois group of $A$ by analyzing its discriminant.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any set $A$ of natural numbers with positive upper Banach density, we show the existence of an infinite set $B$ and sequences $(t_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}, (s_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ of natural numbers such that $\left\{ \sum_{n \in F}n : F \subset B + s_k, 1 \leq |F| \leq k \right\}\subset A-t_k$, for every $k\in \mathbb{N}$. This strengthens the density finite sums theorem of Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson. We further show, given such a set $A$, the existence of an infinite set $B$ and a sequence $(t_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ of natural numbers such that $\left\{ \sum_{n \in F}n : F \subset B, |F| = k \right\}\subset A-t_k$, for every $k\in \mathbb{N}$. As a corollary, we obtain a sequence $(B_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ of infinite sets of natural numbers such that $B_1+\cdots +B_k \subset A$, for every $k\in \mathbb{N}$. We also establish the optimality of our main theorems by providing counterexamples to potential further generalizations, and thereby addressing questions of the aforementioned authors in the context of density analogs to Hindman's finite sums theorem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work we classify the thick subcategories of the bounded derived category of dg modules over a Koszul complex on any list of elements in a regular ring. This simultaneously recovers a theorem of Stevenson when the list of elements is a regular sequence and the classification of thick subcategories for an exterior algebra over a field (via the BGG correspondence). One of the major ingredients is a classification of thick tensor submodules of perfect curved dg modules over a commutative noetherian graded ring concentrated in even degrees, recovering a theorem of Hopkins and Neeman. We give several consequences of the classification result over a Koszul complex, one being that the lattice of thick subcategories of the bounded derived category is fixed by Grothendieck duality.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Added Sections 5.1 and 5.2 on failure of log-concavity in other Lie types and for Jack/Macdonald polynomials. Added Appendix A, exploring the log-concavity of arbitrary simple highest weight characters in type A

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2022, Huh-Matherne-M\'esz\'aros-St. Dizier showed that normalized Schur polynomials are Lorentzian, thereby yielding their continuous (resp. discrete) log-concavity on the positive orthant (resp. on their support, in type $A$ root directions). A reinterpretation of this result is that the characters of finite-dimensional simple representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ are denormalized Lorentzian (DL). In the same paper, these authors also showed that shifted characters of Verma modules over $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ are DL. In this work we extend these results to a larger family of modules that subsumes both of the above: we show that shifted characters of all parabolic Verma modules over $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ are denormalized Lorentzian. The proof involves certain graphs on $[n+1]$; more strongly, we explain why the character (i.e., generating function) of the Kostant partition function of any loopless multigraph on $[n+1]$ is Lorentzian after shifting and normalizing. We then show that parabolic Vermas form a "maximal" class with log-concave (hence DL) characters. Namely, log-concavity fails in greater generality along three natural directions: (1) it does not hold for every simple Lie type, (2) nor for a larger universal family of highest weight modules, the higher order Verma modules, even in type $A$, and (3) it does not always hold for important generalizations of Schur polynomials: the Jack and Macdonald polynomials. Finally, we extend these results to parabolic (i.e. "first order") and higher order Verma modules over the semisimple Lie algebras $\oplus_{t=1}^T \mathfrak{sl}_{n_t+1}(\mathbb{C})$. We also partially resolve a conjecture of Huh et al on the DL property for integral highest weight simple modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a practical method to compute the 2-torsion subgroup of the Jacobian of a non-hyperelliptic curve of genus $3$, $4$ or $5$. The method is based on the correspondence between the 2-torsion subgroup and the theta hyperplanes to the curve. The correspondence is used to explicitly write down a zero-dimensional scheme whose points correspond to elements of the $2$-torsion subgroup. Using $p$-adic or complex approximations (obtained via Hensel lifting or homotopy continuation and Newton-Raphson) and lattice reduction we are then able to determine the points of our zero-dimensional scheme and hence the $2$-torsion points. We demonstrate the practicality of our method by computing the $2$-torsion of the modular Jacobians $J_{0}\left( N \right)$ for $N = 42, 55, 63, 72, 75$. As a result of this we are able to verify the generalised Ogg conjecture for these values.</p></details>

Generalizing these two notions, we introduce the definition of the minimal binomial multiple of $f(X)$ in this paper, which is the monic binomial with the lowest degree among the binomials over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ divided by $f(X)$. Based on the equivalent characterization of binomials via the defining sets of their radicals, we prove that a series of properties of the classical order can be naturally generalized to this case. In particular, the minimal binomial multiple of $f(X)$ is presented explicitly in terms of the defining set of the radical of $f(X)$. And a criterion for $f(X)$ being free of binomials is given. As an application, for any positive integer $N$ and nonzero element $\lambda$ in $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, the $\lambda$-constacyclic codes of length $N$ with minimal distance $2$ are determined.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A much-studied problem posed by Motzkin asks to determine, given a finite set $D$ of integers, the so-called Motzkin density for $D$, i.e., the supremum of upper densities of sets of integers whose difference set avoids $D$. We study the natural analogue of this problem in compact abelian groups. Using ergodic-theoretic tools, this is shown to be equivalent to the following discrete problem: given a lattice $\Lambda\subset \mathbb{Z}^r$, letting $D$ be the image in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$ of the standard basis, determine the Motzkin density for $D$ in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$. We study in particular the periodicity question: is there a periodic $D$-avoiding set of maximal density in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$? The Greenfeld--Tao counterexample to the periodic tiling conjecture implies that the answer can be negative. On the other hand, we prove that the answer is positive in several cases, including the case rank$(\Lambda)=1$ (in which we give a formula for the Motzkin density), the case rank$(\Lambda)=r-1$, and hence also the case $r\leq 3$. It follows that, for up to three missing differences, the Motzkin density in a compact abelian group is always a rational number.</p></details>

We obtain an Braden's hyperbolic localization theorem for such a stack and prove that the constant term functor is t-exact using dimension estimates for affine MV-cycles.

In this paper, we introduce a new concept of a generalized triangulation quiver, extending the notion of a triangulation quiver. Inparticular, it is also shown that the generalized triangulation quivers can be constructed from triangulations of orientable surfaces with marked self-foldedtriangles. Moreover, motivated by the recent results of [28], we define and investigate so called weighted generalized triangulation algebras associated to generalized triangulation quivers, which naturally arise from mutations of weighted triangulation algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study a quantitative notion of exactness within Diophantine approximation. Given $\Psi:(0,\infty)\to (0,\infty)$ and $\omega:(0,\infty)\to (0,1)$ satisfying $\lim_{q\to\infty}\omega(q)=0$, we study the set of points, which we call $E(\Psi,\omega)$, that are $\Psi$-well approximable but not $\Psi(1-\omega)$-well approximable. We prove results on the cardinality and dimension of $E(\Psi,\omega)$. In particular we obtain the following general statements: (i) For any $\omega:(0,\infty)\to (0,1)$ and $\tau>2$ there exists $\Psi:(0,\infty)\to (0,\infty)$ such that $\lim_{q\to\infty}\frac{-\log \Psi(q)}{\log q}=\tau$ and $E(\Psi,\omega)\neq\emptyset.$ (ii) Under natural monotonicity assumptions on $\Psi$ and $\omega,$ we prove that if $\omega$ decays to zero sufficiently slowly (in a way that depends upon $\Psi$) then $E(\Psi,\omega)$ is uncountable. Moreover, under further natural assumptions on $\Psi$ we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension of $E(\Psi,\omega)$. Our main result demonstrates a new threshold for the behaviour of $E(\Psi,\omega)$. A particular instance of this threshold is illustrated by considering functions of the form $\Psi_{\tau}(q)=q^{-\tau}$ when $\tau\in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 3}$. For these functions we prove the following: (iii) If $\omega(q)= Cq^{-\tau(\tau-1)}$ for some sufficiently large $C$ or $\omega(q)=q^{-\tau'}$ for some $\tau'<\tau(\tau-1),$ then $E(\Psi_{\tau},\omega)$ is uncountable and we calculate its Hausdorff dimension. (iv) If $\omega(q)< cq^{-\tau(\tau-1)}$ for some $c\in (0,1)$ for all $q$ sufficiently large then $E(\Psi_{\tau},\omega)=\emptyset.$</p></details>

To obtain sharper bounds in this context, we are led to consider a small subset of the $abc$-hits. Then, it turns out that Collatz iterations as well as Wieferich primes may be used to find large triples in this subset.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the generalized character $\Psi_{1,p,G}$ of a finite group $G$ which vanishes on all $p$-singular elements of $G$ and whose value at each $p$-regular $y \in G$ is the number of $p$-elements of $C_{G}(y)$. We conjecture that this is always a character, and may be afforded by a projective $RG$-module, where $R$ is an appropriate complete discrete valuation ring whose residue field has characteristic $p$. We examine a number of case where this is the case, and consider consequences for the representation theory and character theory of $G$ when this conjecture is known to hold. In particular, we prove, among other things, that the conjecture is valid for all primes $p$ in the case that $G \cong {\rm PSL}(2,q)$ or ${\rm SL}(2,q)$ for every prime power $q$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra, $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ its quantum group, and $U_q(\mathfrak{k}) \subset U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ a quantum symmetric pair subalgebra determined by a Lie algebra automorphism $\theta$. We introduce a category $W_\theta$ of weight $U_q(\mathfrak{k})$-modules, which is acted on by the category of weight $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-modules via tensor products. We construct a universal tensor K-matrix $\mathbb{K}$ (that is, a solution of a reflection equation) in a completion of $U_q(\mathfrak{k}) \otimes U_q(\mathfrak{g})$. This yields a natural operator on any tensor product $M \otimes V$, where $M\in W_\theta$ and $V\in {O}_\theta$, that is $V$ is a $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-module in category ${O}$ satisfying an integrability property determined by $\theta$. Canonically, $W_\theta$ is equipped with a structure of a bimodule category over ${O}_\theta$ and the action of $\mathbb{K}$ is encoded by a new categorical structure, which we call a boundary structure on $W_\theta$. This generalizes a result of Kolb which describes a braided module structure on finite-dimensional $U_q(\mathfrak{k})$-modules when $\mathfrak{g}$ is finite-dimensional. We also consider our construction in the case of the category ${C}$ of finite-dimensional modules over a quantum affine algebra, providing the most comprehensive universal framework to date for large families of solutions of parameter-dependent reflection equations. In this case the tensor K-matrix gives rise to a formal Laurent series with a well-defined action on tensor products of any module in $W_\theta$ and any module in ${C}$. This series can be normalized to an operator-valued rational function, which we call trigonometric tensor K-matrix, if both factors in the tensor product are in ${C}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the truncated symbol $\mathrm{Symb}_0(\mathbb{D})$ of a differential symmetry breaking operator $\mathbb{D}$ between parabolically induced representations. This generalizes the symbol map $\mathrm{Symb}$, which is defined for the case of abelian nilpotent radicals, to the non-abelian setting. The inverse $\mathrm{Symb}_0^{-1}$ of the truncated symbol map $\mathrm{Symb}_0$ enables one to apply a recipe of the F-method for any nilpotent radical. As an application, we classify and construct differential intertwining operators $\mathcal{D}$ on the full flag variety $SL(3,\mathbb{R})/B$ and homomorphisms $\varphi$ between Verma modules. It turned out that, surprisingly, Cayley continuants $\mathrm{Cay}_m(x;y)$ appeared in the coefficients of one of the five families of operators that we constructed. At the end, the factorization identities of the differential operators $\mathcal{D}$ and homomorphisms $\varphi$ are also classified.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a generalized Floquet-Bloch theory for discrete torsion-free nilpotent groups by exploiting their Malcev completions. Our main result is a branching formula that relates finite-dimensional representations of a discrete nilpotent lattice to infinite-dimensional unitary representations of its simply connected nilpotent Lie group. This generalization enables to extend the following two classical asymptotic problems (i) a Chebotarev density analogue for prime closed geodesics on compact negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent covers, and (ii) long time asymptotic expansions of heat kernels on such coverings to the nilpotent setting. As a by-product, we derive a semi-classical expansion for the Harper operator, presenting an alternative to mathematical justification of Wilkinson's formula by Helffer-Sj\"ostrand. We conclude by proposing several avenues for future work: extensions to general hyperbolic flows and noncompact manifolds (in particular knot complements and related quasi-morphisms), connections to modified Riemann-Hilbert problems and opers. Furthermore, we give a brief comment on asymptotic behavior of knot invariants and infinite extensions in number theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Beurling Nyman (BN) family $f_\theta(x) = \{\theta/x\} - \theta\{1/x\}$ in $L^2((0,1])$ through a multiscale ladder parameterisation $\theta_{j,k} = 2^{-j}3^{-k}$ and the associated Gram matrix structure indexed by ladder distance. Using Mellin analysis and a controlled smoothing operator, we establish a rigorous polynomial decay envelope for off-diagonal Gram entries. Specifically, for a Gaussian-type Mellin multiplier we prove that $$|\langle g_{\theta_{j,k}}, g_{\theta_{j',k'}} \rangle| \ll_m \bigl(1 + c d((j,k),(j',k'))\bigr)^{-m}$$ for any $m$ in $\mathbb{N}$, where $c = \min\{\log 2, \log 3\}$ and $d$ denotes the ladder distance. As a consequence we obtain block-compressibility of Gram rows for $m > 2$. These results provide a rigorous foundation for sparsity phenomena in the BN system and support constructive spectral approaches. The analysis is unconditional and independent of any hypothesis concerning the zeros of the zeta function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime, $E$ be a supersingular elliptic curve defined over $\bar{\mathbb{F}}_p$, and $\mathscr{O}$ be its (geometric) endomorphism ring. Earlier results of Chevyrev-Galbraith and Goren-Love have shown that the successive minima of the Gross lattice of $\mathscr{O}$ characterize the isomorphism class of $\mathscr{O}$. In this paper, we refine and extend this work and show that the value of the third successive minimum $D_3$ of the Gross lattice gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the curve to have its $j$-invariant in the field $\mathbb{F}_p$ or in the set $\mathbb{F}_{p^2} \setminus \mathbb{F}_p$, as well as finer information about the endomorphism ring of $E$ when its $j$-invariant belongs to $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$. Finally, in the case where $j(E)$ belongs to $\mathbb{F}_p$, we define a new invariant of the Gross lattice, the Gram matrix of a normalized successive minimal basis, and develop an algorithm to compute it explicitly given the value of the first successive minimum of the Gross lattice.</p></details>

As was revealed by Magee and Puder in [arXiv:1802.04862], the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices. In the first part of the current work [arXiv:2311.17733], we demonstrated how this phenomenon is much broader: we proved more instances of such results and conjectured others. These new results and conjectures involved other topological invariants (relatives of scl) and different families of groups. In the current paper we further extend and support this theory. We provide another instance of the theory and prove that the stable primitivity rank, too, can be expressed in terms of stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements of groups. We introduce concrete formulas for stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements in the symmetric group $S_N$ and its generalizations in the form of the wreath products $G\wr S_N$ where $G$ is an arbitrary compact group. We also define new stable invariants related to these groups, and prove they give bounds to many of the stable Fourier coefficients. As an aside, we generalize to tuples of words a result of Puder and Parzanchevski [arXiv:1202.3269] about the expected number of fixed points of $w$-random permutations.</p></details>

If $A$ is a group algebra $FG$, it boils down to classifying all finite groups $G$ such that the unit groups of most orders in $FG$ belong to a prescribed class $\mathcal{G}$ of infinite groups. We solve this problem for $\mathcal{G}$ consisting of the groups which are virtually a direct product of groups whose Cayley graph has more than one end. Subsequently, we obtain two types of applications. A first type being about the existence of torsion-free normal complements and a second about obtaining short and uniform proofs of some of the main results in [13,18,14,15].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $w$ be a word in a free group. A few years ago, Magee and the first named author discovered that the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices [arXiv:1802.04862]. But the random-matrix side of this equality can be naturally tweaked by considering $w$-random permutations, $w$-random orthogonal matrices and so on, to produce new invariants for any given word. Are these invariants new? interesting? Do they admit an intrinsic topological description as in the case of $w$-random unitaries and scl? The current paper formalizes the definition of these invariants coming from $w$-random matrices, answers the above questions in certain cases involving generalized symmetric groups, and poses detailed conjectures in many others. In particular, we present a plethora of topological, combinatorial and algebraic invariants of words which play, or are at least conjectured to play, a similar role to the one played by scl in the above-mentioned result. Among others, these invariants include two invariants recently defined by Wilton [arXiv:2210.09853]: the stable primitivity rank and a non-oriented analog of scl.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Zamolodchikov periodicity is a property of certain discrete dynamical systems related to bipartite cluster algebras. It was first observed by Zamolodchikov in his study of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, initially for simply-laced Dynkin diagrams. It was proved by Keller to hold for tensor products of two Dynkin diagrams, and further shown by Galashin and Pylyavskyy to hold for pairs of commuting simply-laced Cartan matrices of finite type, which Stembridge classified in his study of admissible $W$-cells. We prove that the Zamolodchikov periodic cluster algebras are in bijection with pairs of commuting (not necessarily reduced or simply-laced) Cartan matrices of finite type. We fully classify all such pairs into 29 infinite families and 14 exceptional types in addition to the 6 infinite families and 11 exceptional types in Stembridge's classification, and show that all of these families can be derived from simply-laced types through folding and transpose. Finally, we find that these pairs are in 1-to-4 correspondence with nonnegative $W$-cells for products of two dihedral groups $W = I_2(p)\times I_2(q)$, which encode the action of the standard generators on the Kazhdan--Lusztig basis of the associated Iwahori--Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(W)$.</p></details>

These invariants, both of which degenerate to the 3D Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev model in a special case, had been open for years to clarify their relationship. Despite the seeming difference in their origins and formal constructions, we prove their equivalence.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>He, Lee, Oliver, and Pozdnyakov~\cite{HLOP} have empirically observed that the average of the $p$th coefficients of the $L$-functions of elliptic curves of particular ranks in a given range of conductors $N$ appears to approximate a continuous function of $p$, depending primarily on the parity of the rank. Hence the sum of $p$th coefficients against the root number also appears to approximate a continuous function, dubbed the murmuration density. However, it is not clear from this numerical data how to obtain an explicit formula for the murmuration density. Convergence of similar averages was proved by Zubrilina~\cite{Zubrilina} for modular forms of weight $2$ (of which elliptic curves form a thin subset) and analogous results for other families of automorphic forms have been obtained in further work~\cite{BBLLD,LOP}. Each of these works gives an explicit formula for the murmuration density. We consider a variant problem where the elliptic curves are ordered by naive height, and the $p$th coefficients are averaged over $p/N$ in a fixed interval. We give a conjecture for the murmuration density in this case, as an explicit but complicated sum of Bessel functions. This conjecture is motivated by a theorem about a variant problem where we sum the $n$th coefficients for $n$ with no small prime factors against a smooth weight function. We test this conjecture for elliptic curves of naive height up to $2^{28}$ and find good agreement with the data. The theorem is proved using the Voronoi summation formula, and the method should apply to many different families of $L$-functions. By a similar approach, we give a prediction murmuration density for elliptic curves of prime conductor, ordered by conductor, again matching the data but lacking a motivating theorem. This is the first work to give an explicit formula for the murmuration density of a family of elliptic curves, in any ordering.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The "pyjama stripe" with parameter $\varepsilon>0$ is the set $E(\varepsilon)$ of all complex numbers $z$ such that the distance from $\Re(z)$ to the nearest integer is at most $\varepsilon$. The Pyjama Problem of Iosevich, Kolountzakis, and Matolcsi asks whether, for every choice of $\varepsilon>0$, it is possible to cover the entire complex plane with finitely many rotations of $E(\varepsilon)$ around the origin. Manners obtained an affirmative answer to this question by studying a $\times 2, \times 3$-type problem over a suitable solenoid. Manners's argument provided no quantitative bounds (in terms of $\varepsilon$) on the number of rotations required, and Green has highlighted the problem of obtaining such quantitative bounds. Our main result is that $\exp\exp\exp(\varepsilon^{-O(1)})$ rotations of $E(\varepsilon)$ suffice to cover the complex plane. Our analysis makes use of the entropic tools developed by Bourgain, Lindenstrauss, Michel, and Venkatesh for quantitative $\times 2, \times 3$-type results.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E$ be an elliptic curve having CM by the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic field $K$ in which $p$ splits. Following Lichtenbaum, the Bernoulli--Hurwitz numbers of $E$ (i.e., values of Eisenstein series evaluated at $E$ up to normalization) admit integral representations given by a $p$-adic measure constructed from an elliptic function. We show that the periods of this measure are in fact special values of a family of weight one Eisenstein series at the CM curve $E$ equipped with certain level data, and explicitly relate it to Katz's one-variable $p$-adic Eisenstein measure, whereby we derive period formulas of the Bernoulli--Hurwitz measure attached to any ordinary elliptic curve $\mathcal{E}$ defined over a local field. Moreover, by exploiting the modularity of these periods, and thanks to the existence of abundant weight one Hasse-type invariants, we present a novel approach to the interpolation property of the Bernoulli--Hurwitz $p$-adic zeta functions of the ordinary elliptic curve $\mathcal{E}$, and obtain a $p$-adic Kronecker's first limit formula.</p></details>

For $|\alpha|<1$, the resulting $\psi$-twisted $L$-function has interesting analytic properties: an enhanced half-plane of absolute convergence, preservation of the Euler product structure, and meromorphic continuation to the complex plane. We give applications to Dirichlet $L$-functions and $L$-functions associated to modular forms.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E$ be a totally real number field of degree $d$ and let $m \geqslant 3$ be an integer. We show that if $md \leqslant 21$ then there exists an $(m-2)$-dimensional family of complex projective $K3$ surfaces with real multiplication by $E$. Analogous results are proved for CM number fields and also for all known higher-dimensional hyperk\"ahler manifolds.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Xiao Han, Peter Schauenburg &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a theory of Hopf BiGalois extensions for Hopf algebroids. We understand these to be left bialgebroids (whose left module categories are monoidal categories) fulfilling a condition that is equivalent to being Hopf in the case of ordinary bialgebras, but does not entail the existence of an antipode map. The immediate obstacle to developing a full biGalois theory for such Hopf algebroids is simple: The condition to be a left Hopf Galois extension can be defined in complete analogy to the Hopf case, but the Galois map for a right comodule algebra is not a well defined map. We find that this obstacle can be circumvented using bialgebroids fulfilling a condition that still does not entail the existence of an antipode, but is equivalent, for ordinary bialgebras, to being Hopf with bijective antipode. The key technical tool is a result of Chemla allowing to switch left and right comodule structures under flatness conditions much like one would do using an antipode. Using this, we arrive at a left-right symmetric theory of biGalois extensions, including the construction of an Ehresmann Hopf algebroid making a one-sided Hopf-Galois extension into a biGalois one. Moreover, we apply a more general 2-cocycle twist theory to Ehresmann Hopf algebroids. As the 2-cocycle is only left linear over the base, the base algebra is also twisted. We also study the Ehresmann Hopf algebroids of quantum Hopf fibrations and quantum homogeneous space as examples.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the existence of a sequence of commutative diagrams generalizing existing results on the cohomology of the Borel-Serre boundary and well-rounded retract to the context of the well-tempered complex. Our main theorem provides a method for computing in finite terms the action of Hecke operators on the equivariant cohomology of an arithmetic subgroup $\Gamma$ of the special linear group $SL_n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is a survey paper about representation theory and noncommutative geometry of reductive p-adic groups G. The main focus points are: 1. The structure of the Hecke algebra H(G), the Harish-Chandra-Schwartz algebra S(G) and the reduced C*-algebra $C_r^* (G)$. 2. The classification of irreducible G-representations in terms of supercuspidal representations. 3. The Hochschild homology and topological K-theory of these algebras. In the final part we prove one new result, namely we compute $K_* (C_r^* (G))$ including torsion elements, in terms of equivariant K-theory of compact tori.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\xi$ be a real number and $b \ge 2$ an integer. We study the relationship between the irrationality exponent of $\xi$ and the subword complexity $p(n, \bfx)$ of the $b$-ary expansion $\bfx$ of $\xi$, where $p(n, \bfx)$ counts the number of distinct blocks of length $n$ in $\bfx$, for $n \ge 1$. If the irrationality exponent of $\xi$ is equal to $2$, which is the case for almost all real numbers $\xi$, we show that the limit superior of the sequence $(p(n, \bfx) / n)_{n \ge 1}$ is at least equal to 4/3. The proof is based on a careful study of the evolution of the Rauzy graphs of infinite words of low complexity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this note, we define the Burnside ring of a monoid, generalizing the construction for groups. After giving foundational definitions, we characterize transitive M-sets and their automorphisms, then prove a structure theorem for a broad class of monoids that allows us to write the Burnside ring as a direct product of Burnside rings of groups. Finally, we define a monoid correlate of the table of marks, and show that the Burnside algebra over the rationals is semisimple.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the modular resolution method using a new tool called a polyserie, introduced by Prof. Wildberger N.J. \& Rubine D. in their recent article \cite{wildberger2025hyper}. In the present article we try to prove an equivalence theorem of the existence and the uniqueness of the solutions of the modular quadratic equations of the form: \begin{equation*} x^{2}+a.x+u\equiv 0\text{ }\left( \mathrm{mod}\text{ }u^{n}\right) , \end{equation*}% by using the same recurrence formula introduced in \cite{wildberger2025hyper} between the Catalan sequence terms: \begin{equation*} C_{n+1}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}C_{k}.C_{n-k,} \end{equation*}% and by introducing the following notions: Wildberger's polynumber sequences (polynomials), binomial Chu-Vandermonde identity, truncated polyseries and finally modular resolution as application.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the representations of rational numbers via continued fraction, Egyptian fraction, and Engel fraction expansions. Given $m \in \mathbb{N}$, denote by $C_m, E_m, E_m^*$ the sets of rational numbers whose continued fraction, Egyptian fraction, and Engel fraction expansions have length $m$, respectively. We establish the Minkowski dimensions of these sets and apply the results to analyze the phase transition phenomenon and sumset-type problems for decreasing sequences.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\psi:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_+$ be a monotonically non-increasing function, and let $\psi_v:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_+$ be defined by $\psi_v(q)=1/q^v$. In this article, we consider self-similar sets whose iterated function systems satisfy the open set condition. For functions $\psi$ that do not decrease too rapidly, we give a conjecturally sharp upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection of $\psi$-well approximable numbers and such self-similar sets. When $\psi=\psi_v$ for some $v$ greater than 1 and sufficiently close to $1$, we give a lower bound for this Hausdorff dimension, which asymptotically matches the upper bound as $v\downarrow 1$. In particular, we show that the set of very well approximable numbers has full Hausdorff dimension within self-similar sets, thus confirming a conjecture of Levesley, Salp, and Velani.</p></details>
