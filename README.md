### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16647v1'>2511.16647</a>\]&nbsp; **The metric theory of small gaps for a sequence of real numbers**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jewel Mahajan &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(a_n)_{n \geq 1}$ be a sequence of distinct positive integers. The metric theory of minimal gaps for the sequence $\{αa_n \text{ mod }1, 1\leq n \leq N\}$ as $N \to \infty$ was initiated by Rudnick, who established that the minimal gap admits an asymptotic upper bound expressible in terms of the additive energy of $\{a_1,\ldots,a_N\}$ for almost every $α$. Later, Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch demonstrated that the metric theory of minimal gaps for such sequences is governed not by the additive energy, but by the cardinality of the difference set of $\{a_1,\ldots,a_N\}$. They established a sharp convergence test for the typical asymptotic order of the minimal gap and proved general upper and lower bounds that are readily applicable. A key element of their proof relies on the resolution of the Duffin--Schaeffer conjecture by Koukoulopoulos and Maynard. In this article, we generalise several results from the article of Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch on \emph{integer} sequences to the case of \emph{real} sequences. While an upper bound for $δ_{\min}^α(N)$ remains elusive, we obtain one for its floored counterpart $\lfloor δ^α_{\min} \rfloor (N)$ for real sequences $(a_n)_{n \geq 1}$ of distinct numbers. Our theorems recover Theorems 1-3, as well as the result from Section 4.3 of the article by Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds for the minimal gaps of well-spaced sequences and, more generally, of a broader family that contains them.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The lonely runner conjecture of Wills and Cusick asserts that if $n$ runners with distinct constant speeds run around a a circular unit length track, starting at a common time and place, then each runner will at some time be separated by a distance of at least $\frac{1}{n}$ from all other runners. A weaker lower bound of $\frac{1}{2n-2}$ follows from the so-called trivial union bound, and subsequent work upgraded this to bounds of the form $\frac{1}{2n}+\frac{c}{n^2}$ for various constants $c>0$. Tao strengthened this to $\frac{1}{2n}+\frac{(\log n)^{1-o(1)}}{n^2}$. In this paper, we obtain a polynomial improvement of the form $$\frac{1}{2n}+\frac{1}{n^{5/3+o(1)}}.$$</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Riccardo Venturi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** cs.FL &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates the conditions under which a given circular (synchronizing) DFA is \emph{simple} (sometimes referred to as \emph{primitive}) and when it is \emph{irreducible}. Our notion of irreducibility slightly differs from the classical one, since we are considering our monoid representations to be over $\mathbb{C}$ instead of $\mathbb{Q}$; nevertheless, several well-known results remain valid-for instance, the fact that every irreducible automaton is necessarily simple. We provide a complete characterization of simplicity in the circular case by means of the \emph{weak contracting property}. Furthermore, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for a circular \emph{contracting automaton} (a stronger condition than the weakly contracting one) to be irreducible, and we present examples illustrating our results.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** El-Mehdi Mehiri &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study a new restricted family of overpartitions, called block-separated overpartitions, in which no two consecutive distinct part-size blocks may both be overlined. Using a two-state transfer-matrix automaton, we derive a closed matrix-product expression for the ordinary generating function, establish an Euler-type factorization, and obtain an explicit normalized recurrence suitable for computation of arbitrary coefficients. We further prove that the possible overlining patterns on the distinct blocks are counted by Fibonacci numbers, giving natural bijections with independent sets on paths, pattern-avoiding binary words, and Fibonacci tilings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we give an expository presentation of the paper of Olivier Mathieu. The paper of Mathieu proves that a Lie group-theoretic conjecture implies the Jacobian Conjecture. To give Mathieu's proof, we first review the required literature on representation theory in an expository way. We continue to prove some results on the irreducible subrepresentations of the tensor algebra of the standard representation of $SL(N,\mathbb{C})$. The last part of the paper is dedicated to Mathieu's proof.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $x\geqslant 2$ and assume that $a$ and $q$ are coprime positive integers. As usual, $ψ(x;q,a):=\sum_{n\leqslant x,n\equiv a(\!\!\!\mod{\!\!q})}Λ(n)$, where $Λ$ is the von Mangoldt function. In 2003, Friedlander and Iwaniec assumed the existence of exceptional characters corresponding to "extreme" Landau-Siegel zeroes and established a meaningful asymptotic formula for $ψ(x;q,a)$ beyond the square-root barrier of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. In particular, their asymptotic yields non-trivial information for moduli $q\leqslant x^{1/2+1/231}$. In this paper, we considerably relax the extremity of the Landau-Siegel zero required in the work of Friedlander and Iwaniec and obtain a conditional asymptotic formula for $ψ(x;q,a)$ in a slightly wider range of $q$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Istvan Miklos, Cordian Riener &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** cs.CC &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Accepted for publication at Theoretical Computer Science

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish the $\#P$-hardness of computing a broad class of immanants, even when restricted to specific categories of matrices. Concretely, we prove that computing $λ$-immanants of $0$-$1$ matrices is $\#P$-hard whenever the partition~$λ$ contains a sufficiently large domino-tileable region, subject to certain technical conditions. We also give hardness proofs for some $λ$-immanants of weighted adjacency matrices of planar directed graphs, such that the shape $λ= (\mathbf{1} + λ_d)$ has size $n$ such that $|λ_d| = n^\varepsilon$ for some $0 < \varepsilon < \frac{1}{2}$, and such that for some $w$, the shape $λ_d/(w)$ is tileable with $1 \times 2$ dominos.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Diksha Rani Bansal, Bibekananda Maji, Pragya Singh &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 28 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Choie and Kumar extensively studied the Herglotz-Zagier-Novikov function $\mathfrak{F}(z;u,v)$, defined as \begin{align*} \mathfrak{F}(z;u,v) = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\log(1-ut^z)}{v^{-1}-t} dt, \quad \textrm{for} \quad \mathfrak{Re}(z)>0. \end{align*} They obtained two-term, three-term and six-term functional equations for $\mathfrak{F}(z;u,v)$ and also evaluated special values in terms of di-logarithmic functions. Motivated from their work, we study the following two integrals, \begin{align*} \mathfrak{F}(z;u,v,w) &=\int_{0}^1 \frac{\log(1-ut^z)\log(1-wt^z)}{v^{-1}-t}\text{d}t, \\ \mathfrak{F}_k(z;u,v) &= \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\log^k(1-ut^z)}{v^{-1}-t} \, \text{d}t, \end{align*} for $\mathfrak{Re}(z)>0$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$. For $k=1$, the integral $\mathfrak{F}_k(z;u,v)$ reduces to $\mathfrak{F}(z;u,v)$. This allows us to recover the properties of $\mathfrak{F}(z;u,v)$ by studying the properties of $\mathfrak{F}_k(z;u,v)$. We evaluate special values of these two functions in terms of poly-logarithmic functions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Pratyush Sarkar &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 42 pages, 1 figure; minor improvements added during publication

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, the two settings we are concerned with are $Γ< \mathrm{SO}(n, 1)$ a Zariski dense Schottky semigroup and $Γ< \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb C)$ a Zariski dense continued fractions semigroup. In both settings, we prove a uniform asymptotic counting formula for the associated congruence subsemigroups, generalizing the work of Magee-Oh-Winter [arXiv:1601.03705] in $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb R)$ to higher dimensions. Superficially, the proof requires two separate strategies: the expander machinery of Golsefidy-Varjú, based on the work of Bourgain-Gamburd-Sarnak, and Dolgopyat's method. However, there are several challenges in higher dimensions. Firstly, using the expander machinery requires a key input: the Zariski density and full trace field property of the return trajectory subgroups, newly introduced in [arXiv:2006.07787]. Secondly, we need to adapt Stoyanov's version of Dolgopyat's method to circumvent some technical issues while the main difficulty is to prove the key inputs: the local non-integrability condition (LNIC) and the non-concentration property (NCP).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Lehmer conjecture states that the non-constant Fourier coefficients of the 24th power of the Dedekind eta function are non-zero. In a recent preprint, Neuhauser and the first author exploited an easily accessible tool from algebraic number theory, namely the Dedekind--Kummer Theorem, to prove the non-vanishing of the Fourier coefficients of certain powers of the Dedekind eta function at roots of unity. We extend the application of this method to enlarge the scope of non-roots of the related D'Arcais polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper studies the Cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory of loop stacks of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks. In particular, we compare $(-1)$-shifted tangent stacks of these moduli problems, which we view as additive, to loop stacks, which we view as multiplicative, via an exponential map that preserves induced $(-1)$-shifted symplectic structures. As an application, we prove for certain moduli of objects of $2$-Calabi-Yau categories a loop dimensional reduction theorem for the loop stacks of these moduli spaces. Finally, we prove a loop version of nonabelian Hodge theory for stacks in the $\mathrm{GL}_n$ case.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 22 pages, 2 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $ξ$ be a real number and $b \ge 2$ an integer. We study the relationship between the irrationality exponent of $ξ$ and the subword complexity $p(n, \mathbf{x})$ of the $b$-ary expansion $\mathbf{x}$ of $ξ$, where $p(n, \mathbf{x})$ counts the number of distinct blocks of length $n$ in $\mathbf{x}$, for $n \ge 1$. If the irrationality exponent of $ξ$ is equal to $2$, which is the case for almost all real numbers $ξ$, we show that the limit superior of the sequence $(p(n, \mathbf{x}) / n)_{n \ge 1}$ is at least equal to 4/3. The proof is based on a careful study of the evolution of the Rauzy graphs of infinite words of low complexity.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Antoine Joux &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** cs.CC &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Since the invention of the famous LLL algorithm, lattice reduction has been an extremely useful tool in computational number theory. By construction, the LLL algorithm deals with lattices living in a vector space endowed with a positive definite scalar product. However, it seems quite nature to ask about the indefinite case, where the scalar product is replaced by an arbitrary quadratic form, possibily indefinite. This question was considered independently in two lines of work. One by G{á}bor Ivanyos and {Á}gnes Sz{á}nt{ó} and one by Denis Simon. Both lead to an algorithm that generalizes LLL and whose performance is very similar to LLL, i.e. a polynomial-time algorithm that approximates the shortest vector within an approximation factor exponential in the dimension. Denis Simon achieves an approximation factor close to that of LLL under the assumption that no isotropic vectors arise during reduction. G{á}bor Ivanyos and {Á}gnes Sz{á}nt{ó} show that it is possible to avoid isotropic vectors altogether, at the cost of a somewhat worse approximation factor. In this paper, we revisit the reduction of indefinite lattices and conclude that it can lead to much better reduced representations that previously thought. We also conclude that the approximation factor depends on the signature of the indefinite lattice rather than on its dimension.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 29 pages, comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a multiple integral representation for each multiple zeta-star value, and utilize these representations to establish a natural order structure on the set of such values. This order structure allows for a one-to-one correspondence between a subset of the infinite sequences of natural numbers and the half line $(1,+\infty)$. Some basic properties of this correspondence are discussed. We also calculate the Hausdorff dimensions for the images of some subsets of the infinite sequences under this correspondence. As a result of this correspondence, we are able to determine the limits for a number of natural multiple integrals. Our analysis also reveals that the set of multiple zeta-star values is dense within the $(1,+\infty)$ domain, and that each value is non-integer in nature.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1973, Swinnerton-Dyer completely classified all congruences for coefficients of normalized eigenforms in weights $k \in \{12, 16, 18, 20, 22, 26\}$ on $Γ_{0}(1) = \mathrm{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ using the theory of modular Galois representations. In this paper, we classify congruences of Type I and Type II considered by Swinnerton-Dyer for the coefficients of eta-quotient newforms in $S_{k}(N, χ)$. When $k \geq 2$, we prove them using the theory of modular forms modulo primes. We also prove extensions of these congruences modulo prime powers.</p></details>

We achieve this by developing an analogue of the Chabauty method, embedding the curve into its generalised Jacobian and bounding the Abel-Jacobi image of the $S$-integral points using arithmetic intersection theory. Our results also provide the foundations for a computational method to determine the set of $S$-integral points on affine curves which will be presented in a follow-up article.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Landau-Selberg-Delange method gives precise asymptotic formulas for the partial sums $\sum_{n \le x} \, a_n$ of a Dirichlet series $\sum_n \, a_n/n^s$ that behaves like a complex power of the Riemann zeta function. However, situations often arise when the Dirichlet series behaves like a product of complex powers of several Dirichlet $L$-functions to a modulus $q$. In such situations, one often requires sharp asymptotic formulas for the partial sums $\sum_{n \le x} \, a_n$ that apply in much wider ranges of $q$ than permitted by known forms of the Landau-Selberg-Delange method. In this manuscript, we address this problem, giving new estimates on $\sum_{n \le x} \, a_n$ in ranges of $q$ that are (in most applications) much wider than attainable from previous results. Our results also weaken certain hypotheses on the size of $\{a_n\}_n$. As applications of our main theorems, we extend Landau's classical results on the distribution of integers with prime factors restricted to progressions, and improve upon Chang, Martin and Nguyen's work on the distributions of the least invariant factors and least primary factors of multiplicative groups. We also extend the classical Sathe-Selberg theorem and study the local laws of the functions $Ω_a(n)$ and $ω_a(n)$, that count (with and without multiplicity, respectively), the number of prime divisors of $n$ lying in the progression $a$ mod $q$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using the Tannakian formalism, we formulate conjectural analogs of Chebotarëv's Density Theorem for $F$-isocrystals over a smooth geometrically irreducible variety defined over a finite field. We prove these analogs for several large classes, including (a) constant $F$-isocrystals, (b) direct sums of isoclinic convergent $F$-isocrystals, (c) semi-simple overconvergent $F$-isocrystals, and (d) semi-simple convergent $F$-isocrystals which have an overconvergent extension. Case (a) is a generalization of the Mordell-Lang Conjecture for tori and enters in the proofs of (b) and (c). For (b) we use the classical Chebotarëv Density Theorem, and point counting techniques in $p$-adic Lie groups building on a result of Oesterlé. For (c) we give two proofs. One of them uses deep input on the Langlands correspondence by Abe and Lafforgue, and the theory of Frobenius weights of Kedlaya, Abe and Caro. Building on this we formulate and prove the $p$-adic analog of Deligne's Equidistribution Theorem. Then (c) follows by applying real algebraic geometry to maximal compact subgroups in complex algebraic groups, measure theory, and a convergence result on complex hypersurfaces. For (d) we develop the theory of maximal quasi-tori (generalizing maximal tori in non-connected linear algebraic groups) and use D'Addezio's result on Crew's parabolicity conjecture to reduce to (b). These arguments also yield a second proof of (c). Besides of the deep inputs mentioned above and some Tannakian arguments, our main technique is the theory of linear algebraic groups. We include a comparison with the recent article of Cadoret and Tamagawa on the same topic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The low-energy expansion of genus-one string amplitudes produces infinite families of non-holomorphic modular forms after each step of integrating over a point on the torus worldsheet which are known as elliptic modular graph forms (eMGFs). We solve the differential equations of eMGFs depending on a single point $z$ and the modular parameter $τ$ via iterated integrals over holomorphic modular forms which individually transform inhomogeneously under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$. Suitable generating series of these iterated integrals over $τ$, their complex conjugates and single-valued multiple zeta values (svMZVs) are combined to attain equivariant transformations under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ such that their components are modular forms. Our generating series of equivariant iterated integrals for eMGFs is related to elliptic multiple polylogarithms (eMPLs) through a gauge transform of the flat Calaque-Enriquez-Etingof connection. By converting iterated $τ$-integrals to iterated integrals over points on a torus, we arrive at an explicit construction of single-valued eMPLs where all the monodromies in the points cancel. Each single-valued eMPL depending on a single point $z$ is found to be a finite combination of meromorphic eMPLs, their complex conjugates, svMZVs and equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals. Our generating series determines the latter two admixtures via so-called zeta generators and Tsunogai derivations which act on the two generators $x$, $y$ of a free Lie algebra and where the coefficients of words in $x,y$ define the single-valued eMPLs.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 72pp

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A_q$ be the alternating central extension of the q-Onsager algebra, a comodule algebra over the quantum loop algebra of $sl_2$. We first classify one-dimensional representations of $A_q$, on which spin-j K-operators constructed in [LBG] act as K-matrices. Using the K-operators and these K-matrices, we construct universal spin-j transfer matrices generating commutative subalgebras in $A_q$. Within a technical conjecture, we derive their fusion hierarchy, the so-called universal TT-relations. On spin-chain representations of $A_q$, we show how the universal transfer matrices evaluate to spin-chain transfer matrices, and as a result we get explicit TT-relations for all values of spins for auxiliary and quantum spaces, any inhomogeneities, and general integrable boundary conditions. In particular, we derive previously conjectured TT-relations. Using the TT-relations, we show that n-th local conserved quantities of the spin-j chains of length N are polynomials of total degree 4Njn in two non-local operators of the q-Onsager algebra. As a result, we give an algorithm of explicit calculation of all conserved quantities (Hamiltonians and higher logarithmic derivatives of the transfer matrix) in terms of spin operators. Furthermore, using the universal TT-relations we derive exchange relations between spin-j Hamiltonians and the two non-local operators, which shows existence of non-trivial symmetries for special boundary conditions, in the sense that they commute with all Hamiltonian densities. As a yet another application of our universal TT-relations we propose universal T-system, Y-system and universal TQ-relations for $A_q$, and as a result, universal TQ for the q-Onsager algebra. In view of application to diagonal boundary conditions, we also obtain universal TT- and TQ-relations for a certain degenerate version of $A_q$ known as centrally extended augmented q-Onsager algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is a contribution to the algebraic study of contextuality in quantum theory. As an algebraic analogue of Kochen and Specker's no-hidden-variables result, we investigate rational subrings over which the partial ring of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices ($d \geq 3$) admits no morphism to a commutative ring, which we view as an "algebraic hidden state." For $d = 3$, the minimal such ring is shown to be $\mathbb{Z}[1/6]$, while for $d \geq 6$ the minimal subring is $\mathbb{Z}$ itself. The proofs rely on the construction of new sets of integer vectors in dimensions 3 and 6 that have no Kochen-Specker coloring.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Stable Reduction Theorem guarantees that any smooth, projective, geometrically irreducible curve of genus $g \geq 2$ over a discretely valued field admits a unique stable model after a finite field extension. Computing this model is a central problem in arithmetic geometry. For non-hyperelliptic genus $3$ curves, which are canonically embedded as plane quartics, methods like admissible reduction become challenging in small residue characteristics. This thesis establishes a precise connection between the abstractly defined stable model and computationally accessible GIT-stable plane models. We prove that a GIT-stable plane model of a smooth plane quartic exists if and only if its stable reduction is non-hyperelliptic. When this condition holds, we show that the stable model is the unique minimal semistable model that dominates the GIT-stable model. The corresponding domination morphism is geometrically explicit: it contracts the $1$-tails of the stable reduction to cusps on the special fiber of the GIT-stable model and is an immersion elsewhere. This result provides a geometric framework for computing the stable model by first finding a GIT-stable model and then resolving its cuspidal singularities.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A classical observation in analysis asserts that lacunary systems of dilated functions show many properties which are also typical for systems of independent random variables. For example, if $(n_k)_{k \ge 1}$ is a sequence of integers satisfying the Hadamard gap condition $n_{k+1}/n_k\ge q > 1,~k \ge 1$, then the normalized sums $\sum_{n=1}^N \cos(2πn_k x)$, considered on the probability space $[0,1]$ with Borel $σ$-field and Lebesgue measure, satisfy the central limit theorem (CLT) and the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL). Remarkably, the situation becomes much more deliacate when the trigonometric function $\cos(2 πx)$ is replaced by a more general 1-periodic function $f$, and fine arithmetic properties of the sequence $(n_k)_{k \ge 1}$ come into play. The most relevant arithmetic property can be phrased in terms of the number of solutions of certain 2-variable Diophantine equations. Recently, the authors proved that the validity of the LIL requires a strictly stronger Diophantine criterion than the CLT. In the present paper we show that this is only a special case of a wide-ranging general principle: there is a sharp cutoff, which can be expressed in form of a Diophantine criterion on the sequence $(n_k)_{k \ge 1}$, at which the tail probabilities of $\sum_{k=1}^N f(n_k x)$ change from Gaussian to potentially erratic behavior. More precisely, let $L(N,a,b,c)$ be the number of solutions $(k,\ell)$ of the equation $a n_k - b n_\ell= c$, where $1\leq k,\ell \leq N$. Roughly speaking, we prove: if $L(N,a,b,c) \le N / g_N$ for some $g_N$, then $\mathbb{P} \left[\sum_{k=1}^N f(n_k x) > t \|f\|_2 \sqrt{N} \right]$ is asymptotically is accordance with standard normal behavior for all $t$ up to $\sqrt{2 \log g_N}$. We also show that this criterion is optimal in the sense that under the same premises, the conclusion can fail to be true for values of $t$ beyond this threshold.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Walled Brauer algebras $B_N ( m , n ) $ illuminate the combinatorics of mixed tensor representations of $U(N)$, with $m$ copies of the fundamental and $n$ copies of the anti-fundamental representation. They lie at the intersection of research in representation theory, AdS/CFT and quantum information theory. They have been used to study of correlators in multi-matrix models motivated by brane-anti-brane physics in AdS/CFT. They have been applied in computing and optimising fidelities of port-based quantum teleportation. There is a large $N$ regime, specifically $ N \ge (m+n)$ where the algebras are semi-simple and their representation theory more tractable. There are known combinatorial formulae for dimensions of irreducible representations and associated reduction multiplicities. The large $N$ regime has a stability property whereby these formulae are independent of $N$. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the combinatorics in the non-semisimple regime of $ N = m +n - l $, with positive $l$. We introduce restricted Bratteli diagrams (RBD) which are useful as an instrument to process known data from the large $N$ regime to calculate representation theory data in the non-semisimple regime. We identify within the non-semisimple regime, a region of $(m,n)$-stability, where $ \min ( m, n ) \ge ( 2l -3) $ and the RBD take a stable form depending on $l$ only and not the choice of $ m,n$ within the region. In this regime, several aspects of the combinatorics of the RBD are controlled by a universal partition function for an infinite tower of simple harmonic oscillators closely related, but not identical, to the partition function of 2D non-chiral free scalar field theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Around 1991, J.M. and P.B. Borwein established a cubic analogue of Jacobi's fundamental identity for theta functions. Their identity serves as the foundation for the subsequent development by B.C. Berndt, S. Bhargava, and F.G. Garvan of Ramanujan's theory of elliptic functions to the cubic base. In 2013, D. Schultz discovered an identity for theta series in three variables which generalizes the Borweins' identity. In this article, we revisit Schultz's identity and present two distinct approaches to its derivation. Our investigation not only provides new proofs but also yields several identities of a similar type. Furthermore, this study enables us to construct new two-variable generalizations of Jacobi's original classical identity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a theory of (etale) Berkovich motives. This is closely related to Ayoub's theory of rigid-analytic motives, but works uniformly in the archimedean and nonarchimedean setting. We aim for a self-contained treatment, not relying on previous work on algebraic or analytic motives. Applying the theory to discrete fields, one still recovers the etale version of Voevodsky's theory. Two notable features of our setting which do not hold in other settings are that over any base, the cancellation theorem holds true, and under only minor assumptions on the base, the stable $\infty$-category of motivic sheaves is rigid dualizable.</p></details>

However, the solution to our problem is much more difficult to come up with.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the function field setting with a fixed characteristic, it was proven by the second and third authors that the values $\log \big|L\big(\frac12, χ_D\big)\big|$ as $D$ varies over monic and square-free polynomials are asymptotically Gaussian distributed on the assumption of a low lying zeros hypothesis as the degree of $D$ tends to $\infty$. For real distinct shifts $t_j$ all of microscopic size or all of nonmicroscopic size relative to the genus, we consider linear combinations of $\log\big|L\big(\frac12+it_j, χ_D\big)\big|$ with real coefficients, and separately, of $\arg L\big(\frac12+it_j, χ_D\big).$ We provide estimates for their distribution functions under the low lying zeros hypothesis. We similarly study distribution functions of linear combinations of $\log\big|L\big(\frac12+it_j, E\otimes χ_D\big)\big|$, and separately $\arg L\big(\frac12+it_j, E\otimesχ_D\big)$, for quadratic twists of elliptic curves $E$ with root number one as the conductor gets large. As an application of these results, we prove a central limit theorem for the fluctuation of the number of nontrivial zeros of such $L$-functions from its mean, and thus recover previous results by Faifman and Rudnick. Correlations of such fluctuations are in harmony with the results of Bourgade, Coram and Diaconis, and Wieand for zeros of the Riemann zeta function and for eigenangles of unitary random matrices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Sawin recently gave an axiomatic characterization of multiple Dirichlet series over the function field $\mathbb{F}_{q}(T)$ and proved their existence by exhibiting the coefficients as trace functions of specific perverse sheaves. However, he did not prove that these series actually converge anywhere, instead treating them as formal power series. In this paper, we prove that these series do converge in a certain region, and moreover that the functions obtained by analytically continuing them satisfy functional equations. For convergence, it suffices to obtain bounds on the coefficients, for which we use the decomposition theorem for perverse sheaves, in combination with the Kontsevich moduli space of stable maps to construct a suitable compactification. For the functional equations, the key identity is a multi-variable generalization of the relationship between a Dirichlet character and its Fourier transform; in the multiple Dirichlet series setting, this uses a density trick for simple perverse sheaves and an explicit formula for intermediate extensions from the complement of a normal crossings divisor.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a generalization of the classical Nicomachus' identity for the sum of the first $n$ cubes. Unlike previous generalizations, it has three rather than two terms, and involves not just one, but two distinct triangular numbers, and each term is of degree $4$ in $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$. The asymptotic behavior for large $n$ leads to continued fractions with remarkable (but conjectural) properties. Moreover, we give a way of looking at squares of triangular numbers that involves the square root of $11$ and show it is a limiting case of a non-obvious identity involving truncations of the continued fraction expansion of that square root. The details involve a nonlinear recurrence that (with appropriate initial conditions) unexpectedly produces only integers, a ``Somos-type'' phenomenon.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(μ, Λ)$ be the canonical spectral pair generated by a Hadamard triple $(N,B,L)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ with $0\in B \cap L$, which means that the family $\big\{ e_λ(x)=e^{2π\mathrm{i} λx}: λ\in Λ\big\}$ forms an orthonormal basis in $L^2(μ)$.We prove that if $\#B < N^{0.677}$, then there are infinitely many primes $p$ such that $(μ, pΛ)$ is also a spectral pair. Under Artin's primitive root conjecture or the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture, the same conclusion holds for $\# B < N$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Lüroth's theorem describes the dominant maps from rational curves over a field. In this note we study those dominant rational maps from cartesian powers $X^Ψ$ of geometrically irreducible varieties $X$ over a field $k$ for infinite sets $Ψ$ that are equivariant with respect to all permutations of the factors $X$. At least some of such maps arise as compositions $h:X^Ψ\xrightarrow{f^Ψ}Y^Ψ\to H\backslash Y^Ψ$, where $X\xrightarrow{f}Y$ is a dominant $k$-map and $H$ is a group of birational automorphisms of $Y|k$, acting diagonally on $Y^Ψ$. In characteristic 0, we show that this construction, when properly modified, gives all dominant equivariant maps from $X^Ψ$, if $\dim X=1$. For arbitrary $X$, the results are only partial. Also, a somewhat similar problem of describing the equivariant integral schemes over $X^Ψ$ of finite type is touched very briefly.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the group $\mathcal G$ which is the semidirect product of the group of analytic functions with values in ${\mathbb C}^*$ on the circle and the group of analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle that preserve the orientation. Then we construct the central extensions of the group $\mathcal G$ by the group ${\mathbb C}^*$. The first central extension, so-called the determinant central extension, is constructed by means of determinants of linear operators acting in infinite-dimensional locally convex topological $\mathbb C$-vector spaces. Other central extensions are constructed by $\cup$-products of group $1$-cocycles with the application to them the map related with algebraic $K$-theory. We prove in the second cohomology group, i.e. modulo of a group $2$-coboundary, the equality of the $12$th power of the $2$-cocycle constructed by the first central extension and the product of integer powers of the $2$-cocycles constructed above by means of \linebreak $\cup$-products (in multiplicative notation). As an application of this result we obtain a new topological Riemann-Roch theorem for a complex line bundle $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$, where $π:M \to B$ is a fibration in oriented circles. More precisely, we prove that in the group $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ the element $12 \, [ {\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is equal to the element $6 \, π_* ( c_1(L) \cup c_1(L))$, where $[{\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is the class of the determinant gerbe on $B$ constructed by $L$ and the determinant central extension.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A semidomain is a subsemiring of an integral domain. One can think of a semidomain as an integral domain in which additive inverses are no longer required. A semidomain $S$ is additively reduced if $0$ is the only invertible element of the monoid $(S,+)$, while $S$ is additively atomic if the monoid $(S,+)$ is atomic (i.e., every non-invertible element $s \in S$ can be written as the sum of finitely many irreducibles of $(S,+)$). In this paper, we describe the additively reduced and additively atomic semidomains $S$ for which every Laurent series $f \in S[[x^{\pm 1} ]]$ that is not a monomial can be written as the sum of at most three multiplicative irreducibles. In particular, we show that, for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$, every polynomial $f \in \mathbb{N}[x_1^{\pm 1}, \ldots, x_k^{\pm 1}]$ that is not a monomial can be written as the sum of two multiplicative irreducibles provided that $f(1, \ldots, 1) > 3$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A(s) = \sum_n a_n n^{-s}$ be a Dirichlet series with meromorphic continuation. Say we are given information on the poles of $A(s)$ with $|\Im s| \leq T$ for some large constant $T$. What is the best way to use such finite spectral data to give explicit estimates on sums $\sum_{n\leq x} a_n$? The problem of giving explicit bounds on the Mertens function $M(x) = \sum_{n\leq x} μ(n)$ illustrates how open this basic question was. Bounding $M(x)$ might seem equivalent to estimating $ψ(x) = \sum_{n\leq x} Λ(n)$ or the number of primes $\leq x$. However, we have long had fairly good explicit bounds on prime counts, while bounding $M(x)$ remained a notoriously stubborn problem. We prove a sharp, general result on sums $\sum_{n\leq x} a_n n^{-σ}$ for $a_n$ bounded, giving an optimal way to use information on the poles of $A(s)$ with $|\Im s|\leq T$ and no data on the poles above. Our bounds on $M(x)$ are stronger than previous ones by many orders of magnitude. (Similar results for $ψ(x)$ are given in a companion paper.) Using rigorous residue computations by D. Platt, we obtain, for $x\geq 1$, $$|M(x)|\leq \frac{3}{π\cdot 10^{10}}\cdot x + 11.39 \sqrt{x}.$$ This is a corollary of our main result, essentially an explicit formula with the contribution of each pole clearly stated; we shall discuss how this finer structure can be useful. Our proof mixes a Fourier-analytic approach in the style of Wiener--Ikehara with contour-shifting, using optimal approximants of Beurling--Selberg type (Carneiro--Littmann, 2013); for $σ=1$, the approximant in (Vaaler, 1985) reappears. While we proceed independently of existing explicit work on $M(x)$ and $ψ(x)$, our method has an important step in common with work on another problem by (Ramana--Ramaré, 2020).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2006, Budur, Mustaţǎ and Saito introduced the notion of Bernstein-Sato polynomial of an arbitrary scheme of finite type over fields of characteristic zero. Because of the strong monodromy conjecture, it should have a corresponding picture on the arithmetic side of ideals in polynomial rings. In this paper, we try to address this problem. Motivated by the Hardy-Littlewood circle method, we introduce the notions of abstract exponential sums modulo $p^m$ and motivic oscillation index of an arbitrary ideal in polynomial rings over number fields. In the arithmetic picture, the abstract exponential sums modulo $p^m$ and the motivic oscillation index of an ideal should play the role of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial and its maximal non-trivial root of the corresponding scheme. We will provide some properties of the motivic oscillation index of ideals in this paper. On the other hand, based on Igusa's conjecture for exponential sums, we propose the averaged Igusa conjecture for exponential sums of ideals. In particular, this conjecture and the motivic oscillation index of ideals will have many interesting applications. We will introduce these applications and prove some variant version of this conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the low-lying zeros of certain Artin $L$-functions associated with $D_4$-quartic function fields. Specifically, we prove that when ordered by conductor, at least $77\%$ of these $L$-functions are non-vanishing at the central point. This generalises and extends results over $\mathbb{Q}$ due to Durlanik, proving that an infinite number of these $L$-functions are non-vanishing. We obtain these results by examining the low-lying zeros of the $L$-functions using the one-level density. Specifically, we apply and extend a method used by Rudnick, who studied Dirichlet $L$-functions associated with quadratic function field extensions, to the $D_4$-case. The main difficulty is studying $L$-functions which are associated to $D_4$-fields whose quadratic subfield is of large discriminant. These $L$-functions are studied by utilising the so-called flipped field of a $D_4$ extension, combining a method introduced by Friedrichsen for counting $D_4$-fields, with explicit ramification theory in such fields provided by Altuğ, Shankar, Varma and Wilson.</p></details>

This paper aims to redefine the probabilistic stirling numbers of the first kind associated with Y such that probabilistic stiirling number of the first kind and probabilistic stirling number of the second kind do satisfy these crucial relations. Furthermore, we investigate their degenerate counterparts, the probabilistic degenerate Stirling numbers of both kinds.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the behavior of Selmer groups of an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ in finite Galois extensions with prescribed Galois group. Fix a prime $\ell \geq 5$, a finite group $G$ with $\#G = \ell^n$, and an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ with $Sel_\ell(E/\mathbb{Q}) = 0$ and surjective mod-$\ell$ Galois representation. We show that there exist infinitely many Galois extensions $F/\mathbb{Q}$ with Galois group $Gal(F/\mathbb{Q}) \simeq G$ for which the $\ell$-Selmer group $Sel_\ell(E/F)$ also vanishes. We obtain an asymptotic lower bound for the number $M(G, E; X)$ of such fields $F$ with absolute discriminant $|Δ_F|\leq X$, proving that there is an explicit constant $δ>0$ such that $M(G, E; X) \gg X^{\frac{1}{\ell^{n-1}(\ell - 1)}} (\log X)^{δ- 1}$. The asymptotic for $M(G, E; X)$ matches the conjectural count for all $G$-extensions $F/\mathbb{Q}$ for which $|Δ_F|\leq X$, up to a power of $\log X$. This demonstrates that Selmer stability is not a rare phenomenon.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The twisted fourth moment of the Riemann zeta-function was established by Hughes and Young [J. Reine Angew. Math. 641 (2010), 203--236] and later improved by Bettin, Bui, Li and Radziwill [J. Eur. Math. Soc. (JEMS) 22 (2020), 3953--3980]. In applications one would often like to take the Dirichlet polynomial to mimic either $1/ζ^r(s)$ (a mollifier) or $ζ(s)^r$ (an amplifier) for some $r>0$. Previous known results include the mean value of the fourth power of $ζ(s)$ times the square or the fourth power of a mollifier, or the square of an amplifier. In this paper we obtain the asymptotic formula for the fourth moment of the Riemann zeta-function times the fourth power of an amplifier. This has various applications to the theory of the Riemann zeta-function, e.g. gaps between zeros of $ζ(s)$ and lower bounds for moments.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We start with background that goes into an Iwahori-theoretic reformulation of the mod $p$ Local Langlands Correspondence (§2). We then explain some classical $p$-adic functional analytic results (§3) that go into defining the $p$-adic Banach space (§4) attached to a two-dimensional semi-stable representation $V_{k,{\mathcal L}}$ of the Galois group of ${\mathbb Q}_p$ of weight $k$ and ${\mathcal L}$-invariant ${\mathcal L}$ under the $p$-adic Local Langlands correspondence. We then sketch how to compute the reduction of a lattice in this Banach space, which along with the Iwahori mod $p$ LLC, allows one to completely determine the mod $p$ reduction of $V_{k,{\mathcal L}}$ for all weights $3 \leq k \leq p+1$ and all ${\mathcal L}$ for $p \geq 5$ (§5). These notes are a summary of our joint work with Anand Chitrao [CG24]. Emphasis is placed on motivation and background rather than completeness.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We adopt a formal and algebraic approach of Early \cite{E2} to study the positive tropical Grassmannian $\mathrm{Trop}^+ Gr_{k,n}$. Specifically, we deal with positroid subdivision of hypersimplex induced by translated blades from any maximal weakly separated collection. One of our main results gives a necessary and sufficient condition on a maximal weakly separated collection to form a positroid subdivision of a hypersimplex corresponding to a simplicial cone in $\rm Trop^+Gr_{k,n}$. For k = 2 our condition says that any weakly separated collection of two-elements sets gives such a simplicial cone, and all cones are of such a form. We also show that the maximality of any weakly separated collection is preserved under the boundary map, which armatively answers a question by Early in \cite{E1}. Plabic graphs, invented by Postnikov \cite{P}, are of use in proving this result. As a corollary, we get that all those positroid subdivisions are the finest. Thus, the flip of two maximal weakly separatedcollections corresponds to a pair of adjacent maximal cones in positive tropical Grassmannian.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Following a recent paper of Anselmo et al., we consider $m \times n$ rectangular matrices formed from the Fibonacci word, and we show that their balance properties can be solved with a finite automaton. We also generalize the result to every Sturmian characteristic word corresponding to a quadratic irrational. Finally, we also examine the analogous question for the Tribonacci word and the Thue-Morse word.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define the period as a multiplicative characteristic of stably symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories, develop its basic properties, and study many examples, with a focus on `ordinary' equivariant and motivic homotopy theory. We apply the findings to isotropic points in motivic tt-geometry. (Includes an appendix by Ivo Dell'Ambrogio on generalized comparison maps in tt-geometry.)</p></details>
