 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Francesco Baldassarri &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop general foundations of topological algebra over a linearly topologized ring k in a format applicable to both formal schemes and analytic adic spaces. We are especially interested in determining quasi-abelian categories of complete linearly topologized k-modules, which are also closed symmetric monoidal for a suitable choice of tensor product and internal Hom, and have enough projectives or injectives. For k a suitably generalized adic ring, we describe here a few examples of such categories consisting of bounded modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the present paper we give very simple general statements which deal with approximation of a real number by rationals and are related to isolation phenomenon. In particular we study functions $ f(x)>f_1(x)>0$ such that existence of solutions $\frac{p}{q}$ of Diophantine inequality $ \left| \alpha -\frac{p}{q}\right|< \frac{f(q)}{q^2} $ leads to the existence of solutions of inequality $ \left| \alpha -\frac{p}{q}\right|< \frac{f_1(q)}{q^2} $.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 10 pages; final version to appear in Acta Arithmetica

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A K3 surface over a number field has infinitely many rational points over a finite field extension. For K3 surfaces of degree 2, arising as double covers of $\mathbb{P}^2$ branched along a smooth sextic curve, we give a bound for the degree of such an extension. Moreover, using ideas of van Luijk and a surface constructed by Elsenhans and Jahnel, we give an explicit family of K3 surfaces of degree 2 defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ with geometric Picard number 1 and infinitely many $\mathbb{Q}$-rational points that is Zariski dense in the moduli space of K3 surfaces of degree 2.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Final version, to appear in Mathematische Annalen

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve, let $p>2$ be a prime of good reduction for $E$, and assume that $E$ admits a rational $p$-isogeny with kernel $\mathbb{F}_p(\phi)$. In this paper we prove the cyclotomic Iwasawa main conjecture for $E$, as formulated by Mazur in 1972, when $\phi\vert_{G_p}\neq 1,\omega$, where $G_p$ is a decomposition group at $p$ and $\omega$ is the Teichm\"uller character. Our proof is based on a study of the anticyclotomic Iwasawa theory of $E$ over an imaginary quadratic field $K$ in which $p$ splits, and a congruence argument exploiting the cyclotomic Euler system of Beilinson--Flach classes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study certain arithmetic properties of an analogue $B(n)$ of Lin's restricted partition function that counts the number of partition triples $\pi=(\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi_3)$ of $n$ such that $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ comprise distinct odd parts and $\pi_3$ consists of parts divisible by $4$. With the help of elementary $q$-series techniques and modular functions, we establish Ramanujan-type congruences modulo $2,3,5,7$, and $9$ for certain sums involving $B(n)$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gal Porat &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The theory of locally analytic representations of $p$-adic Lie groups with $\mathbf{Q}_p$-coefficients is a powerful tool in $p$-adic Hodge theory and in the $p$-adic Langlands program. This perspective reveals important differential structures, such as the Sen and Casimir operators. Rodr\'iguez Camargo and Rodrigues Jacinto developed in \cite{RJRC22} a solid version of this theory using the language of condensed mathematics. This provides more robust homological tools (comparison theorems, spectral sequences...) for studying these representations. In this article, we extend the solid theory of locally analytic representations to a much broader class of mixed characteristic coefficients, such as $\mathbf{F}_p((X))$ or $\mathbf{Z}_p[[X]]\langle p/X\rangle[1/X]$, as well as to semilinear representations. In the introduction, we explain how these ideas could relate to mixed characteristic phenomena in $p$-adic Hodge theory, extend eigenvarieties, and the Langlands program.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 7 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $b(n)$ be the number of partition triples $\pi=(\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi_3)$ of $n$ such that $\pi_1$ consists of distinct odd parts, and $\pi_2$ and $\pi_3$ consist of parts divisible by $4$. Utilizing modular forms, Lin obtained the generating functions for $b(3n+1)$ and $b(3n+2)$, which yields the congruence $b(3n+2)\equiv 0\pmod{3}$ for all $n\geq 0$. We provide in this note elementary proofs of these generating functions by employing $q$-series manipulations and dissection formulas. We also establish infinite families of internal congruences modulo $3$ for $b(n)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 34 pages, 9 figures, v3: explicit jump formula and brief complexity notes added; rpf-form added; conjectures/scope clarified; companion reference added; prime-counting example moved to appendix. Core theorems unchanged. Title adjusted for precision

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A $C^1$ prime indicator $\mathcal{P}\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is constructed by applying the Fej\'er identity to the sine-quotient encoder of trial division. For integers $n\ge 2$, $\mathcal P(n)=0$ holds exactly for odd primes; $\mathcal P(2)>0$. For all non-integers $x>1$ one has $\mathcal P(x)>0$. The function is piecewise $C^\infty$ and its second derivative has jumps precisely at the squares $m^2$, with explicit sizes. Replacing the sharp cut-off by a smooth transition yields $C^\infty$ analogues $\mathcal{P}_\tau$ and $\mathcal{P}_\sigma$ with integer limits $\mathcal{P}_\tau(n;\kappa)\to \tau(n)-2$ and $\mathcal{P}_\sigma(n;\kappa)\to \sigma(n)-n-1$ as $\kappa\to\infty$, obtained from locally uniform convergence of derivative series. For large $\kappa$, numerical evidence indicates companion zeros near odd primes for $\mathcal{P}_\tau$ and an asymmetric pair for $\mathcal{P}_\sigma$. No assertion is made beyond integer input, and no statements are claimed about the prime number theorem or zero distributions of $L$-functions. The appendix includes two illustrative prime-counting sums.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07365v2'>2411.07365</a>\]&nbsp; **Parallelisation of partial differential equations via representation theory**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sheehan Olver &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Incorporating symmetries into the numerical solution of differential equations has been a mainstay of research over the last 40 years, however, one aspect is less known and under-utilised: discretisations of partial differential equations that commute with symmetry actions (like rotations, reflections or permutations) can be decoupled into independent systems solvable in parallel by incorporating knowledge from representation theory. We introduce this beautiful subject via a crash course in representation theory focussed on hands-on examples for the symmetry groups of the square and cube, and its utilisation in the construction of so-called symmetry-adapted bases. Schur's lemma, which is not well-known in applied mathematics, plays a powerful role in proving sparsity of resulting discretisations and thereby showing that partial differential equations do indeed decouple. Using Schr\"odinger equations as a motivating example, we demonstrate that a symmetry-adapted basis leads to a significant increase in the number of independent linear systems. Counterintuitively, the effectiveness of this approach is in fact greater for partial differential equations with less symmetries, for example a Schr\"odinger equation where the potential is only invariant under permutations, but not under rotations or reflections. We also explore this phenomenon as the dimension of the partial differential equation becomes large, hinting at the potential for significant savings in high-dimensions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 48 pages, 33 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Webs are a kind of planar, directed, edge-labeled graph that encode invariant vectors for quantum representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$. The theory of webs developed organically for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, where they are also known as noncrossing matchings and the Temperley-Lieb algebra, before being formalized by Kuperberg for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ as the morphisms in a diagrammatic categorification of quantum representations called the spider category. Various models extend webs to $n \geq 4$. Only Cautis-Kamnitzer-Morrison prove a full set of relations for their webs, though Fontaine's webs are better adapted to computations, more graph-theoretically natural, and directly generalize webs for $n=2$ and $n=3$. This paper formalizes the theory of Fontaine's webs, proving the existence of a deep and powerful global structure on these webs called strandings. We do three key things: 1) give a state-sum formula to construct ($U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_n)$-invariant) web vectors from the orientation of strandings on Fontaine's webs; 2) list and prove a complete set of relations, connecting strandings to the local data of binary labelings that are well-established in the literature; and 3) provide applications and examples of how strandings facilitate computations.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 27 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Weak unipotence of primitive ideals is a crucial property in the study of unitary representations of reductive groups. We establish a sufficient condition, referred to as mild unipotence, which guarantees weak unipotence and is more accessible in practice. We establish mild unipotence for both the $q$-unipotent ideals defined by McGovern and unipotent ideals attached to nilpotent orbit covers defined by Losev-Mason-Brown-Matvieievskyi (arXiv:2108.03453 [math.RT]). Our proof is conceptual and uses the bijection between special orbits in type $D$ and metaplectic special orbits in type $C$ found by Barbasch-Ma-Sun-Zhu (arXiv:2010.16089 [math.RT]) in an essential way.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jonathan M. Fraser, Firdavs Rakhmonov &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Expository article, 20 pages, 6 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The discrete Fourier transform has proven to be an essential tool in many geometric and combinatorial problems in vector spaces over finite fields. In general, sets with good uniform bounds for the Fourier transform appear more `random' and are easier to analyze. However, there is a trade-off: in many cases, obtaining good uniform bounds is not possible, even in situations where many points satisfy strong pointwise bounds. To address this limitation, the first named author proposed an approach where one attempts to replace the need for uniform ($L^\infty$) bounds with suitable bounds for the $L^p$ average of the Fourier transform. In subsequent joint work, the authors applied this approach successfully to improve known results in Fourier restriction and the study of orthogonal projections. In this survey we discuss this general approach, give several examples, and exhibit some of the recent applications.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 26 pages. Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, by some arithmetic properties of the Pell sequence and some $p$-adic tools, we study certain cyclotomic matrices involving squares over finite fields. For example, let $1=s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_{(q-1)/2}$ be all the nonzero squares over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, where $q=p^f$ is an odd prime power with $q\ge7$. We prove that the matrix $$B_q((q-3)/2)=\left[\left(s_i+s_j\right)^{(q-3)/2}\right]_{2\le i,j\le (q-1)/2}$$ is a singular matrix whenever $f\ge2$. Also, for the case $q=p$, we show that $$\det B_p((p-3)/2)=0\Leftrightarrow Q_p\equiv 2\pmod{p^2\mathbb{Z}},$$ where $Q_p$ is the $p$-th term of the companion Pell sequence $\{Q_i\}_{i=0}^{\infty}$ defined by $Q_0=Q_1=2$ and $Q_{i+1}=2Q_i+Q_{i-1}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Since the $\mathrm{Fibonacci}$ sequence has good properties, it's important in theory and applications, such as in combinatorics, cryptography, and so on. In this paper, for the generalized Fibonacci sequence $\left\{W_n\left(a,b,p,q\right)\right\}$, by using elementary methods and techniques, we respectively give the asymptotic estimation values of $\left(\sum\limits_{k=n}^{\infty}\frac{1}{W_{mk+l}^d}\right)^{-1}$ and $\left(\sum\limits_{k=n}^{\infty}\frac{\left(-1\right)^k}{W_{mk+l}^d}\right)^{-1}$, which generalize the asymptotic estimation results of Yuan et al. \cite{A14} in 2025.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is known that every matrix of order n over the maximal order in an algebraic number eld is a sum of k-th powers in various cases if a discriminant condition is satis ed. It has been proved by Wadikar and Katre that for every matrix of size 2 over maximal orders in rational quaternion division algebras is a sum of squares and cubes. In this paper we consider cyclic division algebras over Q of odd prime degree and show that under some conditions every matrix of size greater equal 2 over these noncommutative rings is a sum of squares and a sum of cubes.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Slight revision following the referee's report; 13 pages. Final version, to appear in Mathematical Research Letters

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p\geq5$ be a prime number and let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field where $p$ is unramified. Under mild technical assumptions, in this paper we prove the non-existence of non-trivial finite $\Lambda$-submodules of Pontryagin duals of signed Selmer groups of a $p$-supersingular rational elliptic curve over the anticyclotomic $\mathbb Z_p$-extension of $K$, where $\Lambda$ is the corresponding Iwasawa algebra. In particular, we work under the assumption that our plus/minus Selmer groups have $\Lambda$-corank $1$, so they are not $\Lambda$-cotorsion. Our main theorem extends to the supersingular case analogous non-existence results by Bertolini in the ordinary setting; furthermore, since we cover the case where $p$ is inert in $K$, we refine previous results of Hatley-Lei-Vigni, which deal with $p$-supersingular elliptic curves under the assumption that $p$ splits in $K$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 16 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the cohomology of $C_n(X)$, the moduli space of commuting $n$-by-$n$ matrices satisfying the equations defining a variety $X$. This space can be viewed as a non-commutative Weil restriction from the algebra of $n$-by-$n$ matrices to the ground field. We introduce a ``Fermionic" counterpart $S_n(X)$, constructed as a convolution $X^n \times^{S_n} \mathrm{GL}_n/\mathrm{T}_n$. Our main result establishes that a natural map $\sigma \colon S_n(X) \to C_n(X)$ induces an isomorphism on $\ell$-adic cohomology under mild conditions on $X$ or the characteristic of the field. This confirms a heuristic derived from the classical theory of Weil restrictions and highlights a version of Boson-Fermion correspondence. Furthermore, we derive explicit combinatorial formulae for the Betti numbers of $C_n(X)$ and a Macdonald-type generating series. Finally we prove a Hermitian variant of our main result.</p></details>

In the case that $S$ is a bi-amenable measured semigroup, we characterize the almost weakly stable part using invariant means and averages along F\o lner sequences.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Combining $2$-descent techniques with Riemann-Roch and B\'ezout's theorems, we give an upper bound on the number of rational points of bounded height on elliptic and hyperelliptic curves over function fields of characteristic $\neq 2$. We deduce an upper bound on the number of $S$-integral points, where $S$ is a finite set of places. As a primary application, over small finite fields we bound the $3$-torsion of Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves and the $2$-torsion of Jacobians of trigonal curves. In this setting, these bounds improve on both the trivial geometric bound and the naive inequality coming from the Weil bound, as well as recent upper bounds on $2$-torsion in the work of Bhargava et al.</p></details>

Our focus is on the universal $p$-nilpotent operator seen as an element in the group algebra of the group scheme $\mathbb G_{(r),X}$ over $X$, where $X$ is either the moduli space $V_r(\mathbb G)$ of height $r$ $1$-parameter subgroups of $\mathbb G$ or the moduli space $\mathcal C_r(\mathcal N_p(\mathfrak g))$ of $r$-tuples of $p$-nilpotent, pair-wise commuting elements of the Lie algebra of $\mathbb G$. We formalize Jordan type function using several variants of the continuous function $JT_{\mathbb G,r,M}(-): \mathbb P V_r(\mathbb G) \to \mathcal Y$ where $\mathcal Y$ is the poset of Young diagrams with $p$-columns. One of these variants is designed to be more conducive to computation. The vector bundle construction given by J. Pevtsova and the author is extended to all finite dimensional $\mathbb G_{(r)}$-modules, producing coherent sheaves on $X$ which are locally free on the strata of $X$ associated to $JT_{\mathbb G,r,M}(-)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a base $b\geq 2$ and a set of digits $\mathcal{A}\subset \{0,...,b-1\}$, let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the set of prime numbers with digits restricted to $\mathcal{A}$, when written in base-$b$. We prove that if $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ has positive upper Banach density, then there exists a prime $p\in \mathcal{P}$ and two elements $a_1,a_2\in A$ such that $a_2=a_1+p-1$. The key ingredients are the Furstenberg correspondence principle and a discretized Hardy-Littlewood circle method used by Maynard. As a byproduct of our work, we prove a Dirichlet-type theorem for the distribution of $\mathcal{P}$ in residue classes, and a Vinogradov-type theorem for the decay of associated exponential sums. These estimates arise from the unique structure of associated Fourier transforms, which take the form of Riesz products.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Many interesting questions in arithmetic dynamics revolve, in one way or another, around the (local and/or global) reducibility behavior of iterates of a polynomial. We show that for very general families of integer polynomials $f$ (and, more generally, rational functions over number fields), the set of stable primes, i.e., primes modulo which all iterates of $f$ are irreducible, is a density zero set. Compared to previous results, our families cover a much wider ground, and in particular apply to $100\%$ of polynomials of any given odd degree, thus adding evidence to the conjecture that polynomials with a "large" set of stable primes are necessarily of a very specific shape, and in particular are necessarily postcritically finite.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We extend the Galois-theoretic Borovoi-Springer interpretation of algebraic bands to a class of \'etale-locally represented bands on the fppf site of an arbitrary field $k$, which we call separable bands. Next, a band represented \'etale-locally over $k$ by a pseudo-reductive group is shown to be globally representable when $[k : k^p] = p$, with counterexamples in general. When $k$ is a global or local field, we deduce a generalization of Borovoi's abelianization theory to separable bands represented by smooth connected algebraic groups. As an application, we prove that the Brauer-Manin obstruction is the only obstruction to the Hasse principle for a homogeneous space of a pseudo-reductive group (more generally, of a smooth connected affine algebraic group with split unipotent radical) having a smooth connected geometric stabilizer.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In their 1988 paper "Gluing of perverse sheaves and discrete series representations," D. Kazhdan and G. Laumon constructed an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ associated to a reductive group $G$ over a finite field with the aim of using it to construct discrete series representations of the finite Chevalley group $G(\mathbb{F}_q)$. The well-definedness of their construction depended on their conjecture that this category has finite cohomological dimension. This was disproven by R. Bezrukavnikov and A. Polishchuk in 2001, who found a counterexample in the case $G = SL_3$. In the same paper, Polishchuk then made an alternative conjecture: though this counterexample shows that the Grothendieck group $K_0(\mathcal{A})$ is not spanned by objects of finite projective dimension, he noted that a graded version of $K_0(\mathcal{A})$ can be thought of as a module over Laurent polynomials and conjectured that a certain localization of this module is generated by objects of finite projective dimension, and suggested that this conjecture could lead toward a proof that Kazhdan and Laumon's construction is well-defined. He proved this conjecture in Types $A_1, A_2, A_3$, and $B_2$. In the present paper, we prove Polishchuk's conjecture in full generality, and go on to prove that Kazhdan and Laumon's construction is indeed well-defined, giving a new geometric construction of discrete series representations of $G(\mathbb{F}_q)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The article presents results on the well-known problem concerning the structure of integer polynomials $p_n(z; x, y)$, which define multiplication laws in $n$-valued groups $\mathbb{G}_n$ over the field of complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$. We show that the $n$-valued multiplication in the group $\mathbb{G}_n$ is realized in terms of the eigenvalues of the Kronecker sum of companion Frobenius matrices for polynomials of the form $t^n - x$ in the variable $t$. The notion of a Wendt $(x, y, z)$-matrix is introduced. When $x = (-1)^n$, $y = z = 1$, one recovers the classical Wendt matrix, whose determinant is used in number theory in connection with Fermat's Last Theorem. It is shown that for each positive integer $n$, the polynomial $p_n$ is given by the determinant of a Wendt $(x, y, z)$-matrix. Iterations of the $n$-valued multiplication in the group $\mathbb{G}_n$ lead to polynomials $p_n(z; x_1, \dots, x_m)$. We prove the irreducibility of the polynomial $p_n(z; x_1, \dots, x_m)$ over various fields. For each $n$, we introduce the notion of classes of symmetric $n$-algebraic $n$-valued groups. The group $\mathbb{G}_n$ belongs to one of these classes. For $n = 2, 3$, a description of the universal objects of these classes is obtained.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The main result of this paper is that there is an additive equivalence between $\overline{\mathcal{C}}_n$, the Paquette-Yildirim completion of the discrete cluster categories of Dynkin type $A_{\infty}$, and the perfect derived category of a certain DG algebra. This additive equivalence preserves some of the triangulated structure: it commutes with the suspension functor and preserves triangles with at least two indecomposable terms. In the process, we introduce the notion of a linear generator $G$ in a Krull-Schmidt, Hom-finite triangulated category. It turns out that the existence of a linear generator affords a large amount of control over $\mathcal{T}$. For example, it allows us to describe all indecomposable objects in $\mathcal{T}$ in terms of $G$, to determine all triangles of $\mathcal{T}$ with at least two indecomposable objects, and to show that the Rouquier dimension of $\mathcal{T}$ is at most one. Moreover, we prove that there is an additive equivalence (which preserves some of the triangulated structure) between $\mathcal{T}$ and the perfect derived category of a certain DG algebra. Finally, we show that any triangulated category with a linear generator is additively equivalent to a thick subcategory of $\overline{\mathcal{C}}_n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we give the upper bounds on the variance for cubic moment of Hecke--Maass cusp forms and Eisenstein series respectively. For the cusp form case, the bound comes from a large sieve inequality for symmetric cubes. We also give some nontrivial bounds for higher moments of symmetric cube $L$-functions. For the Eisenstein series case, the upper bound comes from Lindel\"of-on-average type bounds for various $L$-functions. In particular, we establish the sharp upper bounds for the fourth moment of $\mathrm{GL}(2)\times \mathrm{GL}(2)$ $L$-functions and the eighth moment of $\mathrm{GL}(2)$ $L$-functions around special points $1/2+it_j$. Our proof is based on the work of Chandee and Li \cite{C-L20} about bounding the second moment of $\mathrm{GL}(4)\times \mathrm{GL}(2)$ $L$-functions.</p></details>

For this purpose, at the first, we recall Mazur's theory of deforming Galois representations and study both local and global deformation problems. Then, we go through the subject of Taylor-Wiles primes and examine the role that they play on the Galois side and the modular (automorphic) side. At the end, we arrive at the Taylor-Wiles patching method and use it to prove $R=\mathbb{T}$ in both minimal and non-minimal cases. Note that, in the Galois side, we will work with totally real number fields, but for the modular side, we will concentrate on $\mathbb{Q}$ to avoid difficulties of working with Hilbert modular forms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the canonical basis of a modified quantum group $\dot{\mathbf{U}}$ exhibits strong positivity properties for the canonical basis elements arising from spherical parabolic subalgebras. Our main result establishes that the structure constants for both the multiplication with arbitrary canonical basis elements in $\dot{\mathbf{U}}$ and the action on the canonical basis elements of arbitrary tensor products of simple lowest and highest weight modules by these elements belong to $\mathbb{N}[v,v^{-1}]$. This implies, in particular, for quantum groups of finite type, the structure constants for multiplication and for action on tensor product with respect to canonical basis are governed by positive coefficients. A key ingredient is the thickening construction, an algebraic technique that embeds a suitable approximation of the tensor of a lowest weight module and a highest weight module of $\dot{\mathbf{U}}$ into the negative part $\tilde{\mathbf{U}}^-$ of a larger quantum group. This allows us to inherit the desired positivity for the tensor product from the well-established positivity of the canonical basis of $\tilde{\mathbf{U}}^-$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $S(a,b;n)$ be the Kloosterman sum. For any integers $a\neq0,b\neq0,k\geqslant2$, any given complex number $\eta\not=0$ and multiplicative function $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, we show that $$ |\{n\leqslant X:S(a,b;n)=\eta f(n), n \text{ square-free }k\text{-almost prime}\}|\leqslant \pi(\dfrac{X}{L_k})+O(X^{1-\frac{1}{2k}}) $$ and $$ |\{n\leqslant X:S(a,b;n)=\eta f(n), n \text{ square-free}\}|\leqslant \pi(X)+O(Xe^{-\sqrt{\log X}}) $$ as $X\rightarrow \infty$. Here, $L_{k}$ denotes the product of the first $(k-1)$ primes and $\pi(X)$ is the number of primes $\leqslant X$. By providing some examples for which the equality holds, we also prove that these two inequalities are sharp. In particular, these estimates imply that $S(a,b;n)\neq\eta f(n)$ holds for $100\%$ square-free $k$-almost prime numbers and $100\%$ square-free numbers $n$. Counterintuitively, if $S(a,b;p)=\eta f(p)$ holds for all but finitely many primes $p$, we further show that \begin{align*} |\{n\leqslant X:S(a,b;n)=\eta f(n), n \text{ square-free }k\text{-almost prime}\}|\leqslant (|a|+|b|+2k)X^{\frac{k}{k+1}}+O(1). \end{align*} All these demonstrate that $S(a,b;n)$ with fixed $a\neq0$ and $b\neq0$, as an arithmetic function of $n\in\mathbb{N}$ is intrinsically distinct from any complex valued multiplicative function. Similarly, we also show that all these results still hold with the Birch sum $B(a,b;n)$ or the Sali\'e sum $\widetilde{S}(a,b;n)$ in place of $S(a,b;n)$ if and only if the integer pair $a,b$ satisfies some natural conditions respectively.</p></details>

We prove a generalization of this theorem for real reductive algebraic groups.

Restricting to the structure sheaf, we get a characterization of the singularities of the normalization of $\mathcal{N}_\theta.$ We use this to show that for groups of QCT (Definition 2), $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{N}_\theta]$ is equivalent as a $K$-representation to a certain cohomologically induced module giving a new proof of a result in \cite{KostantRallis1971}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By a theorem of Edrei, an infinite, normalised totally nonnegative upper-triangular Toeplitz matrix is determined by a pair of nonnegative parameter sequences, the `Schoenberg parameters', where nonzero parameters correspond to the roots and poles of a naturally associated generating function. These totally nonnegative Toeplitz matrices and their parameters also arise in the classification of characters of the infinite symmetric group by later work of Thoma. Moreover the Schoenberg parameters have an asymptotic interpretation in terms of irreducible representations of S_n and their Young diagrams by Vershik-Kerov. In this article we consider infinite totally positive Toeplitz matrices as limits of finite ones, and we obtain two further asymptotic descriptions of the Schoenberg parameters that are now related to quantum cohomology of the flag variety as n goes to infinity. One is related to asymptotics of normalised quantum parameters, and the other to asymptotics of the Chern classes of the tautological line bundles. We also describe the asymptotics of (quantum) Schubert classes in terms of the Schoenberg parameters. Our limit formulas relate to and were motivated by a tropical analogue of this theory that we survey.

Let $X \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n$ be an integral projective surface over $\mathbb{R}$, let $\widetilde{X}$ be the normalization of $X$, and let $s \in \Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}_X(1))$ be a nonzero section such that $\bigl(\widetilde{X}_{s=0}\bigr)^{\mathrm{red}}$ is formally real. We prove $P\bigl(\Gamma(X_{s\neq 0})\bigr)=\infty$. As a corollary, the Pythagoras numbers of integral smooth affine curves over $\mathbb{R}$ are shown to be unbounded. For any finitely generated $\mathbb{R}$-algebra $A$, if the Zariski closure of the real points of $\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ has dimension less than two, we demonstrate $P(A)<\infty$.</p></details>

To prove our results in positive characteristic, we combine deformation theory and formality results for Hochschild complexes.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the boundedness of the Mordell-Weil rank and the growth of the $v$-primary part of the Tate-Shafarevich group of $p$-supersingular abelian varieties of ${\rm GL}_2$-type with real multiplication over $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of number fields, where $v$ is a prime lying above $p$. Building on the work of Iovita-Pollack in the case of elliptic curves, under precise ramification and splitting conditions on $p$, we construct explicit systems of local points using the theory of Lubin-Tate formal groups. We then define signed Coleman maps, which in turn allow us to formulate and analyse signed Selmer groups. Assuming these Selmer groups are cotorsion, we prove that the Mordell-Weil groups are bounded over any subextensions of the $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension and provide an asymptotic formula for the growth of the $v$-primary part of the Tate-Shafarevich groups. Our results extend those of Kobayashi, Pollack, and Sprung on $p$-supersingular elliptic curves.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Inspired by constructions over the complex numbers of Dolgachev and Alexeev-Engel, we define moduli stacks $\mathcal{M}_{(L,\mathcal{A})/\mathbb{Z}}$ of lattice-polarized K3 surfaces over arbitrary bases, paying particular attention to the open locus $\mathcal{P}_{(L,\mathcal{A})/\mathbb{Z}}$ of primitive lattice polarizations. We introduce the notion of very small ample cones $\mathcal{a}$, after Alexeev and Engel's small cones, to construct smooth, separated stacks of lattice polarized K3 surfaces $\mathcal{P}_{(L,\mathcal{a})/\mathbb{Z}[1/N]}$ over suitable open subsets of $\textrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$. We add level structures, coming from classes in $\mathrm{H}^2(X,\mu_n)$, to build moduli stacks $\mathcal{P}^{[n]}_{(L,\mathcal{A})/\mathbb{Z}}$ with a natural action by $\mathcal{P}_{(L,\mathcal{A})}\otimes \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ whose associated quotient $\mathcal{Q}^{[n]}_{(L,\mathcal{A})}$ contains an open substack $\mathcal{Q}^{(n)}_{(L,\mathcal{A})}$ whose points parametrize pairs K3 surfaces $X$ such that $\textrm{Pic}(X) \simeq L$, together with a class $\alpha \in \textrm{Br}(X)$ of order $n$. When $L$ has rank 19, we show that the coarse moduli space $\mathrm{Q}_{(L,\mathcal{a}),\mathbb{C}}^{(n)}$ is a union of quasi-projective curves, each isomorphic to an open subvariety of the quotient of the upper half plane by a discrete subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$. Fixing a prime $\ell$, we use this comparison to prove that the genus and the gonality of the components of $\mathrm{Q}_{(L,\mathcal{a}),\mathbb{C}}^{(\ell^{m})}$ grows with $m$, and hence that they have finitely many points over number fields of bounded degree. As an application, we furnish a new proof of a result by Cadoret--Charles, showing uniform boundedness of the $\ell$-primary torsion of Brauer groups of K3 surfaces over number fields varying in a $1$-dimensional lattice-polarized family.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the rank-4 case of the conjecture of Ha-Hai-Nghia for the invariant subspace of the truncated polynomial ring $\mathcal{Q}_m(n)=\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dots,x_n]/(x_1^{q^m},\dots,x_n^{q^m}),$ under a new, explicit technical hypothesis. Our argument extends the determinant calculus for the delta operator by deriving crucial rank-4 identities governing its interaction with the Dickson algebra. We show that the proof of the conjecture reduces to a specific vanishing property, for which we introduce a sufficient condition, the "matching hypothesis" H$_{\mathrm{match}}$}, relating the degree structures of Dickson invariants. This condition is justified by theoretical arguments and verified computationally in many cases. Combining this approach with the normalized derivation approach from our prior work, we establish the conjecture.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite group, it is interesting to determine when two ordinary irreducible representations have the same $p$-modular reduction; that is, when two rows of the decomposition matrix in characteristic $p$ are equal, or equivalently when the corresponding $p$-modular Brauer characters are the same. We complete this task for the double covers of the symmetric group when $p=2$, by determining when the $2$-modular reduction of an irreducible spin representation coincides with a $2$-modular Specht module. In fact, we obtain a more general result: we determine when an irreducible spin representation has $2$-modular Brauer character proportional to that of a Specht module. In the course of the proof, we use induction and restriction functors to construct a function on generalised characters which has the effect of swapping runners in abacus displays for the labelling partitions.</p></details>

In the present paper, by generalizing the previous work of Chen and the first author, we introduce the notion of nearly holomorphic Drinfeld modular forms for congruence subgroups of $GL_2(K)$ as continuous but non-holomorphic functions on a certain subdomain of the Drinfeld upper half plane. By extending the de Rham sheaf to a compactification $\overline{M_I^2}$ of the Drinfeld moduli space $M_I^2$, we also describe such forms algebraically as global sections of an explicitly described sheaf on $\overline{M_I^2}$ as well as construct a comparison isomorphism between analytic and algebraic description of them. Furthermore, we show the transcendence of special values of nearly holomorphic Drinfeld modular forms at CM points and relate them to the periods of CM Drinfeld $A$-modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For the each of the five Euclidean rings of complex quadratic integers, we consider a complex continued fraction algorithm with digits in the ring. We show for each algorithm that the maximal digit obeys a Fr\'echet distribution. We use this to find a limiting distribution for cusp excursions on Bianchi orbifolds associated with the aforementioned rings of quadratic integers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the sum of additive characters over finite fields, with a focus on those of specified \(\mathbb{F}_q\)-Order. We establish a general formula for these character sums, providing an additive analogue to classical results previously known for multiplicative characters. As an application, we derive a M\"obius function \(\mu(g)\) for polynomials \(g \in \mathbb{F}_q[x]\), analogous to the integer M\"obius function \(\mu(n)\), and develop a characteristic function for \(k\)-normal elements. We also generalize several classical identities from the integer setting to the polynomial setting, highlighting the structural parallels between these two domains.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring. We establish a close relationship between the strong generation of the singularity category of R and the nonvanishing of the annihilator of the singularity category of R. As an application, we prove that the singularity category of R has a strong generator if and only if the annihilator of the singularity category of R is nonzero when R is a Noetherian domain with Krull dimension at most one. We introduce the notion of the co-cohomological annihilator of modules. If the category of finitely generated R-modules has a strong generator, we show that the infinite injective dimension locus of a finitely generated R-module M is closed, with the defining ideal given by the co-cohomological annihilator of M. Finally, we provide a connection between the existence of an extension generator of the category of finitely generated R-modules and the finiteness of the Krull dimension of R.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\phi$ be a fixed Hecke--Maass form for $\mathrm{SL}_3 (\mathbb{Z})$ and $u_j $ traverse an orthonormal basis of Hecke--Maass forms for $\mathrm{SL}_2 (\mathbb{Z}) $. Let $1/4+t_j^2$ be the Laplace eigenvalue of $u_j $. In this paper, we prove the mean Lindel\"of hypothesis for the second moment of $ L (1/2+it_j, \phi \times u_j) $ on $ T < t_j \leqslant T + \sqrt{T} $. Previously, this was proven by Young on $ t_j \leqslant T$. Our approach is more direct as we do not apply the Poisson summation formula to detect the `Eisenstein--Kloosterman' cancellation.</p></details>
