In this paper, we prove that $A\hat{+}A=\{a_1+a_2\mid a_1,a_2\in A, a_1\neq a_2\}$ has cardinality at least $4p$. This result is the first advancement in over two decades on a variant of the Erd\H{o}s-Heilbronn problem studied by Eliahou and Kervaire.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07950v2'>2506.07950</a>\]&nbsp; **A Categorical Perspective on Braid Representations**

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study categories whose objects are the braid representations, i.e. strict monoidal functors $F\colon B\rightarrow Mat$ from the braid category $B$ to the category of matrices $Mat$. Braid representations are equivalent to solutions to the (constant) Yang-Baxter equation. A major part of the contribution here is to introduce, compare, and contrast suitable notions of isomorphism of representations. A significant contribution here is an extensive range of key examples and counterexamples. Our approach is mainly motivated by the recent classification of charge conserving Yang-Baxter operators, in which the target $Mat$ is replaced by the subcategory $Match^N$. One objective is to understand from the categorical perspective how the classification was facilitated by this change (with the aim of generalising). Progress is made here by observing that the category of functors $MonFun(B,Mat)$ is itself a monoidal category (Theorem 5.3). In addition, we introduce the notion of sub and quotient objects, proving that an object that is both sub and quotient corresponds to an endomorphism in $MonFun(B,Mat)$ (Theorem 5.18). We also observe that objects with target $Match^N$ always have sub and quotient objects. This monoidal category leads us to consider monoidal subcategories whose objects share a given property, giving rise to a new way to see how group-type and involutive solutions, for example, fit into our framework. Another objective is to understand how universal such a restricted target is. Here we give various properties exposing the implications of different choices of equivalence and describe some relationships among them (Theorem 7.18, Theorem 7.9, Conj. 7.19, Conj. 7.22). A key result of this paper is Th.2.9, which shows that, in a `sufficiently free' setting including our case, every monoidal functor is equivalent to a strict one.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04234v2'>2509.04234</a>\]&nbsp; **Simple harmonic oscillators from non-semisimple walled Brauer algebras**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sanjaye Ramgoolam, Michał Studziński &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** hep-th &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Walled Brauer algebras $B_N ( m , n ) $ illuminate the combinatorics of mixed tensor representations of $U(N)$, with $m$ copies of the fundamental and $n$ copies of the anti-fundamental representation. They lie at the intersection of research in representation theory, AdS/CFT and quantum information theory. They have been used to study of correlators in multi-matrix models motivated by brane-anti-brane physics in AdS/CFT. They have been applied in computing and optimising fidelities of port-based quantum teleportation. There is a large $N$ regime, specifically $ N \ge (m+n)$ where the algebras are semi-simple and their representation theory more tractable. There are known combinatorial formulae for dimensions of irreducible representations and associated reduction multiplicities. The large $N$ regime has a stability property whereby these formulae are independent of $N$. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the combinatorics in the non-semisimple regime of $ N = m +n - l $, with positive $l$. We introduce restricted Bratteli diagrams (RBD) which are useful as an instrument to process known data from the large $N$ regime to calculate representation theory data in the non-semisimple regime. We identify within the non-semisimple regime, a region of $(m,n)$-stability, where $ \min ( m, n ) \ge ( 2l -3) $ and the RBD take a stable form depending on $l$ only and not the choice of $ m,n$ within the region. In this regime, several aspects of the combinatorics of the RBD are controlled by a universal partition function for an infinite tower of simple harmonic oscillators closely related, but not identical, to the partition function of 2D non-chiral free scalar field theory.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Charlotte Chan &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Parahoric Deligne--Lusztig induction gives rise to positive-depth representations of parahoric subgroups of $p$-adic groups. The most fundamental basic question about parahoric Deligne--Lusztig induction is whether it satisfies the scalar product formula. We resolve this conjecture for all Howe-factorizable split-generic pairs $(T,\theta)$ -- in particular, for all characters $\theta$ when $T$ is elliptic and $p$ is not a torsion prime for the root system of the $p$-adic group.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19067v1'>2509.19067</a>\]&nbsp; **On the failure of weak convergence for Rademacher random multiplicative functions**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yeor Hafouta &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.PR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 12 pp

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\cP$ be the set of prime numbers, and $X_p,\, p\in\cP$ be a sequence of independent random variables such that $\bbP(X_p=\pm 1)=1/2$. Let $(\te_j)_{j=1}^{\infty}$ the corresponding random multiplicative functions of Radamacher type, namely, $\te_j=\prod_{p|j}X_p$ if $j$ is square free and $\te_j=0$ otherwise. The motivation behind considering these variables comes from the Riemann Hypothesis since $(\te_\ell)$ can be viewed as the random counterpart of the M\"obius function $\mu(\ell)$ and the RH is equivalent to $\sum_{\ell\leq n}\mu(\ell)=o(n^{1/2+\varepsilon}), \forall \varepsilon>0$. Denote $S_n=\sum_{\ell=1}^n\te_\ell$. It is a natural guiding conjecture that $S_n/\sqrt n$ obeys the central limit theorem (CLT). However, S. Chatterjee conjectured (as expressed in \cite{[25]}) that the CLT should not hold. Chatterjee's conjecture was proved by Harper \cite{[17]}, and by now it is a direct consequence of a more recent breakthrough by Harper \cite{Har20} that $\frac{S_n}{\sqrt n}\to 0$ in distribution. Nevertheless, the question whether there exists a sequence $a_n=o(\sqrt n)$ such that $S_n/a_n$ converges to some limit remains a mystery. In this paper we, in particular, show that the answer is negative. Our proof is based on trigonometric identities, Levi's continuity theorem, the prime numbers theorem and the growth rates of the prime omega function $\om(n)$. Combining these tools we show that if a weak limit exists then the characteristic function of $S_n/a_n$ must converge to $0$ at any nonzero point. As a byproduct of our method we are also able to provide essentially optimal upper bounds on high order moments similar to \cite{Har19}, using different methods and for more general $X_p$'s.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17022v2'>2508.17022</a>\]&nbsp; **A closed formula for the Geil-Matsumoto bound on semigroups and curves with many points**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Adler Marques, Erik Mendoza, Luciane Quoos, Guilherme Tizziotti &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Geil-Matsumoto bound (GM bound) constrains the number of rational points on a curve over a finite field in terms of the Weierstrass semigroup of any of the points on the curve. For general numerical semigroups, the GM bound lacks a simple closed-form expression, making its computation a challenging problem. A closed formula has been obtained for the case when the semigroup is generated by two co-prime integers. In this work, for any numerical semigroup, we provide a closed formula for the GM bound in terms of the Ap\'ery set of a nonzero element of the semigroup. In the case where the numerical semigroup is generated by consecutive integers $n, n+1, \dots, n+t$ with $\lceil\textstyle\frac{n-1}{2}\rceil\leq t \leq n-1$, we obtain a simple closed formula for the bound. We apply these results to obtain upper bounds on the number of rational points for algebraic curves over finite fields. In some cases, the GM bound improves some well-known upper bounds on the number of rational points.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\psi$ be a smooth compactly supported function on $\mathbb{X} = SL(2,\mathbb{Z})\backslash\mathbb{H}$. In this paper, we are interested in the joint cubic moments of automorphic forms when the spectral parameters go to infinity. We show that the diagonal case for Eisenstein series $\int_{\mathbb{X}}\psi(z)E(z,1/2+it)^{3} d\mu z = \mathcal{O}_{\psi}(t^{-1/3+\varepsilon})$. In off-diagonal case we prove $\frac{1}{2\log t}\int_{\mathbb{X}}\psi(z)|E(z,1/2+it)|^{2}g(z)d\mu z = o(1)$ as long as $\min\{t , t_{g}\} \rightarrow \infty$. Finally we show $\int_{\mathbb{X}}\psi(z)f^{2}(z)g(z)d\mu z = o(1)$ in the range $|t_{f} - t_{g}| \leq t_{f}^{2/3-\varepsilon}$ where $f,g$ are two Hecke-Maass cusp forms.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hidekazu Furusho &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 24 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper introduces a $p$-adic analogue of Gauss's hypergeometric function, constructed via a method that is distinct from distinct from Dwork's approach. The idea of our construction is motivated by the Ohno-Zagier formula, which is elucidated through the relationship between the hypergeometric differential equation and the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equation. We develop a rigorous framework for the residue-wise analytic prolongation of our $p$-adic hypergeometric function by exploring its relationship with $p$-adic multiple polylogarithms. Through a detailed analysis of its local behavior near the point $1$, we show a $p$-adic version of Gauss hypergeometric theorem for the function.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a new connection between the iHowe duality of type AIII established by Luo-Xu and the iSchur duality established by Bao-Wang. We show that iweight $\overline{\rho}$ space in the iHowe duality is naturally isomorphic to the tensor space in the iSchur duality. Under this isomorphism, we show that the relative braid group action on this iweight space coincides with the action of the type B Hecke algebra in the iSchur duality. As a consequence, we derive from multiplicity-free decompositions that the iweight $\overline{\rho}$ spaces of irreducible modules over iquantum groups are irreducible modules over the type B Hecke algebra. Meanwhile, in the iHowe duality, we identify the relative braid group action from one side with the action of $K$-matrices and $R$-matrices from the other side.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We interpret the ranks of the rational homotopy groups of a K3 surface as dimensions of representations for the largest sporadic simple Mathieu group. We then construct a vertex algebra equipped with an action by the largest Mathieu group, and use it to associate Jacobi forms to this interpretation, in a compatible way. Our results suggest a topological role for the sporadic simple Mathieu groups in the theory of K3 surfaces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we investigate the positivity of the real part of the log-derivative of the Riemann $\xi$-function in the region $1/2+1/\sqrt{\log t}<\sigma<1$, where $t$ is sufficiently large. We provide an explicit lower bound for $\mathfrak{R}\sum_{\rho}1/(s-\rho)$, where the summation runs over the zeta-zeros on the critical line. We also consider hypothetical cases of positivity of the log-derivative of the Riemann $\xi$-function in the provided region, assuming that there are non-trivial zeta-zeros off the critical line.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 75 pages, 14 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe the center of quantum tori appearing in quantum higher Teichm\"uller theory when the quantum parameter is an even root of unity. This is a subsequent of the work in the odd roots of unity case. The centers of the quantum tori help to understand those of (reduced) stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras via quantum trace maps. Moreover, we compute the PI-degree of the quantum tori, which are the same with those of (reduced) stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras. As corollaries, we give matrix decompositions for anti-symmetric integer matrices for the quantum tori.</p></details>

> **Comment:** It replaces the manuscript titled "Emerton-Gee stacks for tame groups, II"

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct the parabolic version and the reductive version of the integral de Rham moduli stacks of Langlands parameters ($p>3$). We allow the group to be arbitrarily ramified. We propose that the top Chow group of the reduced Emerton-Gee stack $\mathcal{X}_{^L\!G}$ is isomorphic to that of the moduli of Weil-Deligne representations valued in $^L\!B$, where $^L\!B$ is a Borel of $^L\!G$. The latter bears a concrete description by Serre weights corrected by the Kottwitz homomorphism. We explicitly define such a map using parabolic de Rham moduli stacks as the composition of a chain of tautological maps, and confirm it is an isomorphism for (1) algebraic tori, (2) unitary, orthogonal and symplectic groups, (3) tame groups when restricted to the cyclotomic-free part of the Chow groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study function fields of curves over a base field $K$ which is either a global field or a large field having a separable field extension of degree divisible by $4$. We show that, for any such function field, Hilbert's 10th Problem has a negative answer, the valuation rings containing $K$ are uniformly existentially definable, and finitely generated integrally closed $K$-subalgebras are definable by a universal-existential formula. In order to obtain these results, we develop further the usage of local-global principles for quadratic forms in function fields to definability of certain subrings. We include a first systematic presentation of this general method, without restriction on the characteristic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent paper, we proved that for any large enough odd modulus $q\in \mathbb{N}$ and fixed $\alpha_2\in \mathbb{N}$ coprime to $q$, the congruence $$ x_1^2+\alpha_2x_2^2+\alpha_3x_3^2\equiv 0 \bmod{q} $$ has a solution of $(x_1,x_2,x_3)\in \mathbb{Z}^3$ with $x_3$ coprime to $q$ of height $\max\{|x_1|,|x_2|,|x_3|\}\le q^{11/24+\varepsilon}$ for, in a sense, almost all $\alpha_3$, where $\alpha_3$ runs over the reduced residue classes modulo $q$. Here it was of significance that $11/24<1/2$, so we broke a natural barrier. In this paper, we average the moduli $q$ in addition, establishing the existence of a solution of height $\le Q^{3/8+\varepsilon}\alpha_2^{\varepsilon}$ for almost all pairs $(q,\alpha_3)$, with $Q$ large enough, $Q<q\le 2Q$, $q$ coprime to $2\alpha_2$ and $\alpha_3$ running over the reduced residue classes modulo $q$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The U-dualities of maximally supersymmetric non-chiral supergravity (SUGRA) theories lead to strong constraints on the non-perturbative structure of quantum gravity. In this paper we determine Spin- and Pin-lifts of these dualities, which extend this action to fermionic degrees of freedom. Among other things, this allows us to access non-supersymmetric sectors of these low energy effective field theories in which bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom are treated differently. We use this refinement of the duality groups, in tandem with the Swampland Cobordism Conjecture, to predict new codimension-two branes. These are a natural generalization of the recently discovered R7-branes of type II string theories. The first bordism groups for Spin-twisted duality bundles follow directly from the Abelianization of the duality groups. Viewing the SUGRA theory as the low energy limit of a toroidal compactification of M-theory, winding around these codimension-two defects enacts a reflection around one of the torus directions, which in the effective field theory appears as a charge conjugation symmetry. We establish some basic properties of such branes, including determining BPS objects which can end on it, as well as braiding rules and bound states realized by multiple reflection branes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Inspired by the foundational work of Bezrukavnikov and Chan \cite{BC24} on character sheaves for parahoric subgroups and an alternative interpretation of deep level Deligne-Lusztig characters in \cite{Nie_24}, we present a parallel but closed (non-iterated) construction of character sheaves within the framework of J.--K. Yu's types. We show that our construction yields perverse sheaves, which coincide with those produced in \cite{BC24} in an iterated way. In the regular case we establish the compatibility of their Frobenius traces with deep level Deligne-Lusztig characters. As an application, we prove the positive-depth Springer's hypothesis for arbitrary characters, thereby generalizing the generic case result of Chan and Oi \cite{CO25}. The proofs of our results make critical use of the strategies and results from \cite{BC24} and \cite{Nie_24}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a calculus based on graph enumeration for calculating $S_n$-equivariant motivic invariants of graphically stratified moduli spaces. We apply our theory to the Deligne--Mumford moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}$ and to the space of torus-fixed stable maps $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}(X, \beta)^{\mathbb{C}^\star}$ when the target $X$ admits an appropriate $\mathbb{C}^\star$-action, deriving new formulas in each case. A key role is played by the P\'olya--Petersen character of a graph, which enriches P\'olya's classical cycle index polynomial. This character is valued in an algebra $\Lambda^{[2]}$ of wreath product symmetric functions, which we study from combinatorial and representation--theoretic perspectives. We prove that this algebra may be viewed as the Grothendieck ring of the category of polynomial functors which take symmetric sequences of vector spaces to vector spaces, building on foundational work of Macdonald. This leads to a plethystic action of $\Lambda^{[2]}$ on the ring $\Lambda$ of ordinary symmetric functions. Using this action, we derive our formulas, which ultimately involve only ordinary symmetric functions and the Grothendieck ring of mixed Hodge structures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The conformal bootstrap in physics has recently been adapted to prove remarkably sharp estimates on Laplace eigenvalues and triple correlations of automorphic forms on compact hyperbolic surfaces. These estimates derive from an infinite family of algebraic equations satisfied by this spectral data. The equations encode $G$-equivariance and associativity of multiplication on $\Gamma \backslash G$, for $\Gamma$ a cocompact lattice in $G = \text{PSL}_2(\mathbf{R})$. The effectiveness of the conformal bootstrap suggests that the equations characterize hyperbolic surface spectra, i.e., that every solution to the equations comes from a compact hyperbolic surface. This paper proves this rigorously with no analytic assumptions on the solution except discreteness of the spectrum. The key intermediate result is an axiomatic characterization of representations of $G$ of the form $L^2(\Gamma \backslash G)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a recently discovered carrollian bosonic string, described classically by a sigma model where both the worldsheet and the target spacetime are carrollian. After fixing the carrollian analogue of the conformal gauge, we determine the Lie algebra of residual gauge symmetries and show it is isomorphic to the three-dimensional extended BMS algebra. We quantise the sigma model \`a la BRST and determine the spectrum of the corresponding string theory by computing the BRST cohomology. In contrast with the usual bosonic string, the spectrum of the carrollian string is finite-dimensional. The cohomology displays Poincar\'e duality and can be interpreted, for a given momentum, as inducing representations for unitary irreducible representations of the 26-dimensional Carroll group. Furthermore we interpret (most of) the cohomology as deformations of the spacetime carrollian structure augmented by the Kalb--Ramond field to which the carrollian string couples.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 33 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we provide a simple way to construct $d$-abelian categories via bounded derived categories for certain values of $d$. Namely, let ${\mathcal C}$ be an abelian category, and let ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ denote the full subcategory of the bounded derived category of ${\mathcal C}$ whose objects $X$ satisfy that $H_*(X)$ is concentrated in degrees $j$ where $0 \leq j \leq m$. We prove that if ${\mathcal C}$ is hereditary, then ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ is a $d$-abelian category where $d = 3m + 1$. Beyond offering a uniform method for constructing $d$-abelian categories, this construction allows us to create $d$-abelian categories that exhibit some unexpected properties depending on the choice of the category ${\mathcal C}$. For instance, if ${\mathcal C}$ is the category of abelian groups, then ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ is a $d$-abelian category which is not $\mathbb{K}$-linear over a field $\mathbb{K}$ but has set indexed products and coproducts. Similarly, if ${\mathcal C}$ is the category of coherent sheaves over certain algebraic curves, then ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ is a $d$-abelian category without enough injectives. We extend our results to $(n+2)$-angulated categories. Namely, let $M$ be an $n$-cluster tilting object over an $n$-representation finite algebra and let ${\mathcal T}$ be the corresponding $(n+2)$-angulated category with $n$-suspension functor $\Sigma_n$. We prove that the full subcategory ${\mathcal T}[0,m] = \mathrm{add} \bigoplus^{m}_{j=0}\Sigma^j_n M$ is a $d$-abelian category where $d = (n+2)(m+1)-2$. Furthermore, we show that there is a bijection between the functorially finite wide subcategories of $\mathrm{add}\,M$ and the functorially finite repetitive wide subcategories of ${\mathcal T}[0,m]$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$, the ratio set or the quotient set of $A$ is defined by $R(A):=\{a/b: a, b\in A, b\neq 0\}$. It is an open problem to study the denseness of $R(A)$ in the $p$-adic numbers when $A$ is the set of values attained by an integral form. In this paper, we consider the question of whether this happens for all but finitely many $p$. We prove that if a form is non-singular and has at least three variables, then the ratio set of its values is dense in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for all sufficiently large $p$. We conjecture that the same statement is true for non-degenerate forms of prime degree having sufficiently many variables, which is indeed the case when the degree is 2, 3, or 5. Still, we give two counterexamples when the assumptions of the conjecture are not satisfied. The first one happens when the number of variables is equal to the degree. The other works for any number of variables but only for composite degrees. Our innovation is to consider the problem in terms of varieties defined by forms, thereby using the tools from algebraic geometry, making their first appearance in this setting. Finally, we construct integral forms such that the ratio set of its values is dense in at least one $\mathbb{Q}_p$ but only in finitely many of them.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Pell equation $x^2 - Dy^2 = 1$ with non-square $D > 1$ has infinitely many integer solutions, yet most research has centered on the asymptotic behavior of fundamental units as $D$ varies. By contrast, the exact distribution of solutions for a fixed $D$ within bounded regions has received little attention. In this paper, we contribute to this direction by giving an explicit enumeration of all solutions to the Pell equation inside the square $|x| + |y| \leq \lambda$ for any $\lambda > 0$. We further extend our results to the shifted Pell equation $\left(x-a\right)^2 - D\left(y-b\right)^2 = 1$ for integers $a$ and $b$, obtaining exact counts for sufficiently large $\lambda$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $d(n)$ be the divisor function and it is well known that $\sum_{1\leq n \leq x}d(n) = x\log x+(2\gamma-1)x +\mathcal{O}\left(x^{\theta+\epsilon}\right)$ where $\gamma$ is the Euler constant, $\epsilon>0$ and $1/4<\theta<1/3$. In this paper, we obtain an asymptotic formula for the number of irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{so}(5)$. More precisely, the irreducible representations of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}(5)$ are a family of representations of dimension $jk(j+k)(j+2k)/6$ for $j, k\in \mathbb{N}_{0}$ and suppose that $\varrho_{\mathfrak{so}(5)}(n)$ is the number of irreducible $\mathfrak{so}(5)$ representations of dimension $n$. We obtain an asymptotic formula for the summatory function $\sum_{1\leq n \leq x}\varrho_{\mathfrak{so}(5)}(n)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to undertake an in-depth study of the phenomenon behind the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem, which, in its modern form due to Kamae and Mend\`es-France, states that if $E$ is a set of integers with positive density and $P$ is an intersective polynomial, then there are distinct elements $x, y \in E$ such that $x - y = P(n)$ for some some $n$. In this paper, we identify an algebraic framework (rings of integers of global fields) for Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy-type theorems. One of our main results establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for a polynomial to satisfy the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over the ring of integers of a global field, providing an extension of the result of Kamae and Mend\`es-France. The Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy phenomenon goes beyond infinite rings and has interesting additional aspects in finite rings. As an example, classical exponential sum estimates can be used to show that large subsets of finite fields contain the asymptotically ``correct'' number of pairs $(x,y)$ whose difference is a square. In previous work, the class of polynomials satisfying this strong form of the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over finite fields was classified. In the present paper, we establish asymptotic results characterizing sequences of finite principal ideal rings that produce ``correct'' statistics in the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem and show that these families are much more general than finite fields. As an application of our enhanced forms of the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over finite rings, we produce new families of examples of quasirandom graphs of algebraic origin. The production of these new examples hinges on a two-way connection between asymptotic total ergodicity -- the phenomenon responsible for enhanced versions of the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over finite fields and rings -- and quasirandomness.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We suggest a new algorithm to estimate representations of compact Lie groups from finite samples of their orbits. Different from other reported techniques, our method allows the retrieval of the precise representation type as a direct sum of irreducible representations. Moreover, the knowledge of the representation type permits the reconstruction of its orbit, which is useful for identifying the Lie group that generates the action, from a finite list of candidates. Our algorithm is general for any compact Lie group, but only instantiations for SO(2), T^d, SU(2), and SO(3) are considered. Theoretical guarantees of robustness in terms of Hausdorff and Wasserstein distances are derived. Our tools are drawn from geometric measure theory, computational geometry, and optimization on matrix manifolds. The algorithm is tested for synthetic data up to dimension 32, as well as real-life applications in image analysis, harmonic analysis, density estimation, equivariant neural networks, chemical conformational spaces, and classical mechanics systems, achieving very accurate results.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we explore how functor-induced isomorphisms are encoded by $G$-matrices. We first show that the Grothendieck group isomorphism induced by a tilting module can be realized via the $G$-matrix of this tilting module. Building on this, we compare $g$-vectors for a tilted algebra and its associated hereditary algebra, and provide $G$-matrix interpretations of the Coxeter transformation, the Nakayama functor, and the Auslander-Reiten translation for suitable algebras. Furthermore, we demonstrate that every element of any symmetric group and Weyl group can be expressed as the transpose of the $G$-matrix of some tilting module or support $\tau$-tilting module. Finally, we show that the Grothendieck group isomorphism induced by a $2$-term silting complex can also be realized via the $G$-matrix of this $2$-term silting complex.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\overline{p}_{k}(n)$ denote the number of overpartition $k$-tuples of $n$. In 2023, Saikia \cite{saikia} conjectured the following congruences: \begin{align*} \overline{p}_{q}(8n+2)& \equiv 0 \pmod{4},\quad \overline{p}_{q}(8n+3)\equiv 0 \pmod{8},\quad \overline{p}_{q}(8n+4) \equiv 0 \pmod{2},\\ \overline{p}_{q}(8n+5)& \equiv 0 \pmod{8},\quad \overline{p}_{q}(8n+6) \equiv 0 \pmod{8},\quad \overline{p}_{q}(8n+7)\equiv 0 \pmod{32}, \end{align*} where $n\geq0$ and $q$ is prime. Recently, Sellers \cite{sellers2024elementary} showed that these congruences hold for all odd integers $q$ (not necessarily prime). In this paper, we show that the above congruences hold for all positive integers $q$ (not necessarily odd). We also prove the following congruences on $\overline{OPT}_k(n)$, the number of overpartition $k$-tuples with odd parts of $n$: For all $i,j\geq 1$, $n\geq 0$, $r$ not a multiple of 2, $k$ not a multiple of 2 or 3, and $\ell$ not a power of 2, nor a multiple of 2 or 3, we have \begin{align*} \overline{OPT}_{2^i\cdot r}(8n+7)& \equiv 0 \pmod{2^{i+4}}, \overline{OPT}_{3^i\cdot 2^j\cdot k}(3n+2)& \equiv 0 \pmod{3^{i+1}\cdot 2^{j+2}}, \overline{OPT}_{3^i\cdot 2^j\cdot k}(3n+1)& \equiv 0 \pmod{3^{i}\cdot 2^{j+1}},\\ \overline{OPT}_{3^i\cdot \ell}(3n+2)& \equiv 0 \pmod{3^{i+1}\cdot 2}, \overline{OPT}_{3^i\cdot \ell}(3n+1)& \equiv 0 \pmod{3^{i}\cdot 2},\end{align*} where the first congruence was posed as a conjecture by Sarma et al. \cite{saikiasarma} and the latter four were conjectured by Das et al. \cite{DSS}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Finding the largest pair of consecutive $B$-smooth integers is computationally challenging. Current algorithms to find such pairs have an exponential runtime -- which has only be provably done for $B \leq 100$ and heuristically for $100 < B \leq 113$. We improve this by detailing a new algorithm to find such large pairs. The core idea is to solve the shortest vector problem (SVP) in a well constructed lattice. With this we are able to significantly increase $B$ and notably report the heuristically largest pair with $B = 751$ which has $196$-bits. By slightly modifying the lattice, we are able to find larger pairs for which one cannot conclusively say whether it is the largest or not for a given $B$. This notably includes a $213$-bit pair with $B = 997$ which is the largest pair found in this work.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Major revision of convergence analysis (Sec 5). Main claim corrected from absolute to conditional convergence. The operator is now rigorously defined via a hyperbolic Cauchy principal value to handle singularities. The analysis is restricted to the necessary subdominant solution for convergence

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper constructs a weight-shifting integral operator, U_{k,t}, that maps the space of weight-k Maass forms to the space of weight-t functions for the full modular group SL(2,Z). The operator is defined via an integral transform whose kernel is the product of a covariant factor and a modular invariant function, F. The central hypothesis is that the kernel itself must be an eigenfunction of the weight-t hyperbolic Laplacian. We show this spectral condition reduces the determination of F to a Papperitz-Riemann equation, which is then transformed into the standard Gauss Hypergeometric Differential Equation. We provide an explicit determination of the hypergeometric parameters in terms of the initial automorphic data and rigorously establish the operator's region of conditional convergence. The automorphy of the transformed function is proven. In contrast, other key properties such as smoothness and the intertwining condition are supported by conditional arguments that rely on analytical assumptions deferred to future work. Finally, the emergence of the hypergeometric structure suggests a potential connection to the theory of hypergeometric motives, a perspective illustrated by the recovery of the periods of the Legendre family of elliptic curves in a specific case.</p></details>

We prove that the number of their $\mathbb{F}_q$-points is given by finite hypergeometric sums under certain general conditions. In the process, we introduce the notion of a gamma triple, which allows us to extend the classical definition of finite hypergeometric sums to prime powers corresponding to the cyclotomic field of definition of the associated monodromy representation. As a special case of our main results, we study the Dwork family and obtain a formula for the number of its $\mathbb{F}_q$-points.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be an arbitrary field of characteristic $p$ and let $G$ be a finite group. We investigate the representation type, derived representation type, and singularity category of the $k$-linear (cohomological) Mackey algebra. We classify when the cohomological Mackey algebra is wild for $G$ a cyclic $p$-group. Furthermore, we show the cohomological Mackey algebra is derived wild whenever $G$ surjects onto a $p$-group of order more than two, and the Mackey algebra is derived wild whenever $G$ is a nontrivial $p$-group. Derived wildness has some immediate consequences in equivariant homotopy theory. In particular, for the constant Mackey functor $\underline{k}$, the classification of compact modules over the $G$-equivariant Eilenberg--MacLane spectrum $H\underline{k}$ is also wild whenever $G$ surjects onto a $p$-group of order more than two. Thus, in contrast to recent work at the prime $2$ by Dugger, Hazel, and the second author, no meaningful classification of compact $C_p$-equivariant $H\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p$-modules exists at odd primes. For the Burnside Mackey functor $\underline{A}_k$, there is no classification of compact $G$-equivariant $H\underline{A}_k$-modules whenever $G$ is a nontrivial $p$-group.</p></details>

With the local models we are able to prove, under the Taylor-Wiles hypothesis, the existence of certain companion points on the global eigenvariety and the appearance of related companion constituents in the completed cohomology for non-regular crystalline Galois representations. The new ingredients in the proof of the global applications are results relating the partial classicality of locally analytic representations (the existence of non-zero locally algebraic vectors in the non-Borel parabolic Emerton's Jacquet modules), the partially de Rham properties of Galois representations (the de Rhamness of graded pieces along the paraboline filtrations of the associated $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over the Robba rings) and the relevant properties of cycles on the generalized Steinberg varieties. We prove that partial classicality implies partial de Rhamness in finite slope cases using Ding's partial eigenvarieties.</p></details>

One class involves products of cyclotomic harmonic numbers, while the other involves products of cyclotomic odd harmonic numbers. We derive explicit formulas for the parity of linear and quadratic cases of these cyclotomic Euler-type sums and provide several illustrative examples. The results for the linear and quadratic cases ensure that we can provide explicit formulas for the parity of cyclotomic multiple $T$-values and cyclotomic multiple $S$-values up to depth three, both of which are even-odd variants of cyclotomic multiple zeta values. Furthermore, we present declarative theorems concerning the parity of these two types of cyclotomic Euler-type sums to arbitrary orders. Additionally, using contour integration techniques, we explore explicit linear and quadratic formulas for these cyclotomic Euler-type sums under more general conditions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $Z$ be an l.c.i. scheme over $\mathbb{C}$. In this paper, we introduce a Kashiwara--Schapira-style functor of derived microlocalization, which we use to define a perverse sheaf $\mu_{Z}$ on the $-1$-shifted cotangent bundle, $T^*[-1]Z$. The sheaf $\mu_{Z}$ is designed to be a refinement of the microlocal homology of $Z$: a family of invariants introduced by Nadler that interpolates between the singular cohomology and Borel--Moore homology of $Z$. Our main result is an equivalence between $\mu_{Z}$ and the DT sheaf $\varphi_{T^*[-1]Z}$ on $T^*[-1]Z$. This provides an alternative construction for the DT sheaf in the case of a shifted cotangent bundle. The main step of our argument, which may be of independent interest, is a local computation -- closely related to one obtained recently by Kinjo using different methods -- providing a description of the classical microlocalization functor in terms of vanishing cycles.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\lfloor x\rfloor$ denote the integer part of $x$. For every sequence $(C_k)_{k\ge 1}$ of positive integers, we define $\xi(C_k)$ as the smallest real number $\xi>1$ such that $\lfloor \xi^{C_k} \rfloor$ is a prime number for every positive integer $k$. The number $\xi(3^k)$ is called Mills' constant. Recently, the author showed that $\xi(3^k)$ is irrational, but the transcendency of this number is still open. In this paper, we give sufficient conditions on $(C_k)_{k\ge 1}$ to determine the transcendency of $\xi(C_k)$. For example, we obtain the following three results: (A) $\xi(\lfloor b^k\rfloor)$ is irrational for every real number $b\geq 1+\sqrt{2}$; (B) $\xi((1+\sqrt{2})^k+(1-\sqrt{2})^k)$ is transcendental; (C) $\xi(r3^k-1)$ is transcendental for every integer $r\geq 4.003\times 10^{14}$. Furthermore, assuming the Riemann hypothesis, $\xi(3^k-1)$ is transcendental. However, we still do not know whether Mills' constant is transcendental.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The higher-order quantum Casimir elements, introduced by Zhang, Bracken, and Gould in the early 1990s, were conjectured to generate the centre of the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum (super)groups. This was previously confirmed in the classical type A. In this paper we extend the result to the classical types B, C, D, with the additional inclusion of quantum Casimir elements arising from spin and half-spin representations in types B and D. We identify the Harish-Chandra images of these elements and reinterpret them uniformly in terms of irreducible characters associated with hook partitions. This yields explicit and minimal generating sets for the centres in all classical types, and provides new connections between higher-order quantum Casimir elements and hook partitions that exhibit a stability phenomenon.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We will describe solvable lattice models whose partition functions depend on two sets of variables, $x_1,\cdots,x_n$ and $y_1, y_2, \cdots $ that have different connections with the representation theory of $\text{GL}(n,F)$ where $F$ is a nonarchimedean local field. If the boundary conditions are chosen in one way, they are essentially the Motivic Chern classes that were used very effectively by Aluffi, Mihalcea, Sch\"urmann and Su (AMSS) to study such problems. In particular, using this specialization we can obtain deformations $r_{u,v}$ of the Kazhdan-Lusztig R-polynomials that were used by Bump, Nakasuji and Naruse to study matrix coefficients of intertwining operators (introduced by Casselman). Thus we are able see that the recursion formula for the $r_{u,v}$ is a reflection of the Yang-Baxter equation. On the other hand, with more general boundary conditions, specializing the parameters $y_i\to 0$ we recover colored lattice models that were previously used by Brubaker, Buciumas, Bump and Gustafsson to represent Iwahori Whittaker functions on $GL(n,F)$. Thus we term the resulting two-variable-set family of functions as ``double Whittaker polynomials.''</p></details>

In the first part of the current work [arXiv:2311.17733], we demonstrated how this phenomenon is much broader: we proved more instances of such results and conjectured others. These new results and conjectures involved other topological invariants (relatives of scl) and different families of groups. In the current paper we further extend and support this theory. We provide another instance of the theory and prove that the stable primitivity rank, too, can be expressed in terms of stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements of groups. We introduce concrete formulas for stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements in the symmetric group $S_N$ and its generalizations in the form of the wreath products $G\wr S_N$ where $G$ is an arbitrary compact group. We also define new stable invariants related to these groups, and prove they give bounds to many of the stable Fourier coefficients. As an aside, we generalize to tuples of words a result of Puder and Parzanchevski [arXiv:1202.3269] about the expected number of fixed points of $w$-random permutations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $w$ be a word in a free group. A few years ago, Magee and the first named author discovered that the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices [arXiv:1802.04862]. But the random-matrix side of this equality can be naturally tweaked by considering $w$-random permutations, $w$-random orthogonal matrices and so on, to produce new invariants for any given word. Are these invariants new? interesting? Do they admit an intrinsic topological description as in the case of $w$-random unitaries and scl? The current paper formalizes the definition of these invariants coming from $w$-random matrices, answers the above questions in certain cases involving generalized symmetric groups, and poses detailed conjectures in many others. In particular, we present a plethora of topological, combinatorial and algebraic invariants of words which play, or are at least conjectured to play, a similar role to the one played by scl in the above-mentioned result. Among others, these invariants include two invariants recently defined by Wilton [arXiv:2210.09853]: the stable primitivity rank and a non-oriented analog of scl.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The 2-switch-degree of $G$ is the number of distinct 2-switches acting on a graph $G$. In this work we study structural properties of the 2-switch-degree, with a focus on split graphs. Our approach is motivated by the Tyshkevich decomposition, which uniquely expresses any graph as a composition $G_r \circ \ldots \circ G_1$ of indecomposable graphs, where $G_2, \ldots, G_r$ are split. Our key tool is the factor graph $\Phi(S)$, a multigraph associated with a split graph $S$ that encodes 2-switch-degree information via edge multiplicities between independet vertices of $S$. By leveraging $\Phi(S)$, we reduce the problem of classifying indecomposable split graphs to enumerating and analyzing unlabeled connected multigraphs of fixed size. Using this method, we fully classify indecomposable split graphs of degrees 1, 2, 3, and 4. Further, we introduce and investigate the $\Delta$-property, a surprising connection between Graph Theory and Number Theory that arises from $n$-simple triangles (3-cycles with uniform edge multiplicity $n$) of the factor graph.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Final version, expanded proof of the multiplicative property in section 7

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We formulate a precise connection between the new Drinfeld presentation of a quantum affine algebra $U_q\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$ and the new Drinfeld presentation of affine coideal subalgebras of split type recently discovered by Lu and Wang. In particular, we establish a ``factorization formula'', expressing the commuting ``Drinfeld-Cartan''-type operators $\Theta_{i,k}$ in a coideal subalgebra in terms of the corresponding Drinfeld generators of $U_q\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$, modulo the ``Drinfeld positive half" of $U_q\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$. We study the spectra of these operators on finite dimensional representations, and describe them in terms of rational functions with an extra symmetry. These results can be seen as the starting point of a $q$-character theory for affine Kac--Moody quantum symmetric pairs. Additionally, we prove a compatibility result linking Lusztig's and the Lu-Wang-Zhang braid group actions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The partition function, $p_A(n)$, is defined to be the number of partitions of $n$ with parts in the set A, where $n$ is a positive integer and $A$ is a set of positive integers. It is well documented that: if A is a finite set with $\gcd(A)=1$ and $|A|=k$, then $$p_A(n)\sim \frac{n^{k-1}}{(\prod_{a\in A}a)(k-1)!}. $$ Number of proofs have been obtained for this estimate. In this article, we give a new proof for the above estimate by making use of the fact that: $p_A(n)$ is a $quasi\ polynomial$ when A is a finite set.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A(1,m)$ be the Fourier coefficients of a $SL(3,\mathbb{Z})$ Hecke-Maass cusp form $\pi_1$ and $\lambda(m)$ be those of a $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ Hecke holomorphic or Hecke-Mass cusp form $\pi_2$. Let $H\subset[\![ -X^{1-\varepsilon},X^{1+\varepsilon}]\!]$ and $\{a(h)\}_{h\in H}\subset\mathbb{C}$ be a sequence. We show that if $H\subset \ell+[\![ 0,X^{1/2+\varepsilon}]\!] $ for some $\ell\geq0$, \begin{align*} D_{a,H}(X):=\frac{1}{|H|}\sum_{h\in H}a(h)\sum_{m=1}^\infty A(1,m)\lambda(rm+h)V\left(\frac{m}{X}\right)\ll_{\pi_1,\pi_2,\varepsilon} \frac{X^{1+\varepsilon}}{|H|}\|a\|_2 \end{align*} for any $\varepsilon>0$, and a similar bound when $|H|$ is big. This improves Sun's bound and generalizes it to an average with arbitrary weights. Moreover, we demonstrate how one can recover the factorizable moduli structure given by the Jutila's circle method via studying a shifted sum with weighted average. This allows us to recover Munshi's bound on the shifted sum with a fixed shift without using the Jutila's circle method.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1959, Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres posed a series of problems concerning the size of polynomials of the form $$ P_n(z) = \prod_{j=1}^n (1 - z^{s_j}), $$ where $s_1, \dots, s_n$ are positive integers. Of particular interest is the quantity $$ f(n) = \inf_{s_1,\dots,s_n\ge 1} \max_{|z|=1} |P_n(z)|. $$They proved that $\lim_{n\to\infty} f(n)^{1/n} = 1$, and also established the classical lower bound $f(n) \ge \sqrt{2n}$. However, despite extensive effort over more than six decades, no stronger general lower bound had been established. In this paper, we obtain the new bound $$ f(n) \ge 2\sqrt{n}. $$This gives the first improvement of the classical lower bound for the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres problem in the general case since 1959. In particular, our result confirms a remark of Billsborough et al., who observed that if the original Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres proof could be fixed, the O'Hara--Rodriguez bound would yield exactly this inequality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the envelopes of holomorphy of Matsuki orbits $M_{\ell,m,r}$ arising as intersections of $G_0$- and $K$-orbits in complex Grassmannians. These orbits, equipped with natural CR-structures, form a class of compact homogeneous CR-submanifolds whose analytic continuation properties are of fundamental interest. Building on Rossi's theory of holomorphic extension, we establish that the envelope of holomorphy of each Matsuki orbit coincides biholomorphically with the containing $K$-orbit $O_{\ell,m}$. Our approach provides a geometric proof based on the holomorphic fiber bundle structure $\pi : M_{\ell,m,r} \to \mathrm{Gr}_{\ell}(E_+) \times \mathrm{Gr}_{m}(E_-)$, clarifying the role of compact isotropic fibers in constraining holomorphic extension. Explicit examples, including the orbit $M_{1,1,1} \subset \mathrm{Gr}_3(\mathbb{C}^8)$, illustrate the method and highlight connections with classical constructions in complex geometry and representation theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Based on the intrinsic connection between Gaussian Free Fields and the Heisenberg vertex algebra, we study some aspects of the correspondence between probability theory and $W$-algebras. This is first achieved by providing a construction of the $W$-algebra associated to a complex simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ by means of Gaussian Free Fields. This correspondence in turn allows to translate algebraic statements into actual constraints for free-field correlation functions. This leads to new integrability results for Dotsenko-Fateev integrals associated to $\mathfrak g$, such as Ward identities and the derivation of a new Fuchsian differential equation for deformations of $B_2$-Dotsenko-Fateev integrals arising from the Mukhin-Varchenko conjecture. Along the proof of this statement we also provide new results on representation theory of $W$-algebras such as the description of some singular vectors for the $W$-algebra associated to $\mathfrak g=B_2$.</p></details>

In this paper we present a new proof of this result, which also gives an improved error term as $X\rightarrow\infty$. Similar to Afifurrahman's result, our error term is uniform in both $n$ and $X$, and our estimates are significant for $X$ as small as $n^{1/2+\delta}$. To complement this, we also demonstrate that the exponent $1/2+\delta$ in this statement cannot be reduced, by establishing a result which gives a different asymptotic main term when $n$ is either a prime or the square of a prime, and when $X=n^{1/2}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a generalized Floquet-Bloch theory for discrete torsion-free nilpotent groups by exploiting their Malcev completions. Our main result is a branching formula that relates finite-dimensional representations of a discrete nilpotent lattice to infinite-dimensional unitary representations of its simply connected nilpotent Lie group. This generalization enables to extend the following two classical asymptotic problems (i) a Chebotarev density analogue for prime closed geodesics on compact negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent covers, and (ii) long time asymptotic expansions of heat kernels on such coverings to the nilpotent setting. As a by-product, we derive a semi-classical expansion for the Harper operator, presenting an alternative to mathematical justification of Wilkinson's formula by Helffer-Sj\"ostrand. We conclude by proposing several avenues for future work: extensions to general hyperbolic flows and noncompact manifolds (in particular knot complements and related quasi-morphisms), connections to modified Riemann-Hilbert problems and opers. Furthermore, we give a brief comment on asymptotic behavior of knot invariants and infinite extensions in number theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It has been known for some time that the orders in the four dimensional matrix algebra over a local field that can be written as a finite intersection of maximal orders are precisely those whose Gorenstein closure is Eichler. In this paper, a similar characterization is given for orders whose Gorenstein closure is a Bass order. A second characterization, this time for the Bass orders themselves, is given in terms of their branches, i.e., maximal subgraphs of the Bruhat-Tits tree whose vertices are orders containing them.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we use inductive methods similar to those employed in a 2025 paper by Alberts, Lemke Oliver, Wang and Wood in order to prove many new cases of the Twisted Malle's Conjecture. Previously, this conjecture had only been proven for $T \trianglelefteq G$ where $T$ is abelian, and for $S_3^m \trianglelefteq S_3 \wr B$. We prove many new examples of this conjecture, such as for $A \wr M \trianglelefteq A \wr B$ where $A$ is a finite abelian $p$-group, $B$ is a $p$-group, and $M$ is a proper abelian normal subgroup of $B$, and for $C_p \wr M \trianglelefteq C_p \wr B$, where $|B|$ is odd and $M$ is a proper abelian normal subgroup of $B$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Friezes are infinite arrays of numbers, in which every four neighbouring vertices arranged in a diamond satisfy the same arithmetic rule. Introduced in the late 1960s by Coxeter, and further studied by Conway and Coxeter in their remarkable papers from 1973, this topic has been nearly forgotten for over thirty years. But since the discovery of connections to cluster algebras and categories of type $A$, interest in friezes has exploded, several generalizations have been studied, and links to geometry and combinatorics have been explored. In this article we will review some of the most striking results connecting the purely combinatorially defined friezes with triangulations of polygons, Grassmannian cluster algebras and (Grassmannian) cluster categories. Then we will focus on Grassmannian cluster categories and some recent results linking them to friezes.</p></details>
