<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $α_1, \cdots, α_d$ be real numbers, and let $S$ be the set of integers $s$ so that $||α_i s||_{\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}}>δ$ for some $i$ and some fixed $δ>0$. We prove $S$ is not \enquote{$2$-large}, i.e. there is a $2$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ that avoids arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions with common differences in $S$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jan Feldmann, Martin Raum &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe Jacobi forms of vector-valued weights in terms of classical ones, extending previous results by Ibukiyama and Kyomura to the case of arbitrary cogenus. As in their result, our isomorphisms are given by holomorphic covariant differential operators. In contrast to previous work, however, we avoid explicit calculations, which we replace by general differential geometric arguments. In the process, we obtain a structure theorem on nearly holomorphic functions on the Jacobi upper half space.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Alessandro Breccia, Federica Gerace, Marco Lippi, Gabriele Sicuro, Pierluigi Contucci &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** cs.AI &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 21 pages, 8 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study whether a Large Language Model can learn the deterministic sequence of trees generated by the iterated prime factorization of the natural numbers. Each integer is mapped into a rooted planar tree and the resulting sequence $ \mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$ defines an arithmetic text with measurable statistical structure. A transformer network (the GPT-2 architecture) is trained from scratch on the first $10^{11}$ elements to subsequently test its predictive ability under next-word and masked-word prediction tasks. Our results show that the model partially learns the internal grammar of $\mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$, capturing non-trivial regularities and correlations. This suggests that learnability may extend beyond empirical data to the very structure of arithmetic.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Milo Bechtloff Weising &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 23 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the representation theory of the infinite type A Hecke algebra over a non-Archimedean field in the case where the parameter is a pseudo-uniformizer. Specifically, we consider a family of representations, called almost-symmetric, which satisfy additional topological and algebraic constraints. We give a full classification of the irreducible almost-symmetric representations. These turn out to be indexed by integer partitions arising as topological completions of specific direct limits of Hecke-Specht modules. We give detailed analysis of these representations and construct functionals analogous to finite Hecke algebra traces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce numerical cohomology for arithmetic surfaces, which leads to an absolute version of arithmetic Riemann-Roch formula. As an application, we derive an upper bound for the self-intersection number of relative dualizing sheaf in terms of successive minima with respect to $L^2$-norm. The result has the geometric analogue that the slopes of the Harder-Narasimhan filtration of relative dualizing sheaf provide an upper bound for self-intersection number. Suppose that the arithmetic surface admits a section and has generic fiber of genus at least two, we obtain a refined upper bound for the self-intersection number, which is governed by the topological and arithmetic information of the section.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 39 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a novel $n(n+1)/2$-dimensional non-semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_n$, a generalisation of both $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{K})$ and the two-photon Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}_6$. We investigate its properties, including its structure, representations, and its Casimir elements. In particular, we prove that there exists only one non-trivial Casimir polynomial of degree $n$ given by the determinant of an $n\times n$ symmetric matrix. We then associate this Lie algebra to a hierarchy of Hamiltonian systems with integrability properties depending on $n$, and describe their first integrals as sums of squares of linear combinations of the components of the angular momentum. In particular, we obtain that these systems are integrable for $n=2$, quasi-integrable for $n=3$, and of Poincaré-Lyapunov-Nekhoroshev type for $n\geq4$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01779v1'>2512.01779</a>\]&nbsp; **A discrete approach to Dirichlet L-functions via spectral models: special values and zeros**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Anders Karlsson, Dylan Müller &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 24 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study Dirichlet $L$-functions via discrete analogs $L_n$ arising from the spectral theory of cyclic graphs as $n\rightarrow \infty$. Using a refined Euler-Maclaurin asymptotic expansion due to Sidi, together with an independent polynomiality property of these finite spectral sums at integers, we obtain exact special-value formulas, even starting at $n=1$. This yields new expressions for certain trigonometric sums of interest in physics, and recovers, by a different method, the striking formulas of Xie, Zhao, and Zhao. It also gives infinite families of recursion relations among special values of the Riemann zeta function and of Dirichlet $L$-functions. Concerning zeros, we prove that, for odd primitive characters, a natural asymptotic functional equation for the discrete functions $L_n$ is equivalent to the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for the corresponding Dirichlet $L$-function. We also provide some remarks about the non-existence of possible real zeros.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01739v1'>2512.01739</a>\]&nbsp; **Quantitative correlations and some problems on prime factors of consecutive integers**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Terence Tao, Joni Teräväinen &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 60 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider several old problems involving the number of prime divisors function $ω(n)$, as well as the related functions $Ω(n)$ and $τ(n)$. Firstly, we show that there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $ω(n+k) \leq Ω(n+k) \ll k$ for all positive integers $k$, establishing a conjecture of Erdős and Straus. Secondly, we show that the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} ω(n)/2^n$ is irrational, settling a conjecture of Erdős. Thirdly, we prove an asymptotic formula conjectured by Erdős, Pomerance and Sárközy for the number of $n\leq x$ satisfying $ω(n)=ω(n+1)$, for almost all $x$, with similar results for $Ω$ and $τ$. Common to the resolution of all these problems is the use of the probabilistic method. For the first problem, this is combined with computations involving a high-dimensional sieve of Maynard-type. For the second and third problems, we instead make use of a general quantitative estimate for two-point correlations of multiplicative functions with a small power of logarithm saving that may be of independent interest. This correlation estimate is derived by using recent work of Pilatte.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01729v1'>2512.01729</a>\]&nbsp; **Non-crossing partitions for exceptional hereditary curves**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Barbara Baumeister, Igor Burban, Georges Neaime, Charly Schwabe &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a new class of reflection groups associated with the canonical bilinear lattices of Lenzing, which we call reflection groups of canonical type. The main result of this work is a categorification of the corresponding poset of non-crossing partitions for any such group, realized via the poset of thick subcategories of the category of coherent sheaves on an exceptional hereditary curve generated by an exceptional sequence. A second principal result, essential for the categorification, is a proof of the transitivity of the Hurwitz action in these reflection groups.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Krishnendu Gongopadhyay, Tathagata Nayak &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Revised version. More focused title

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $ρ: Γ\to G$ be an Anosov representation, with $Γ$ a word hyperbolic group and $G$ a semisimple Lie group. Previous works (Guichard--Wienhard, Kapovich--Leeb--Porti, and Carvajales--Stecker) constructed an open domain of discontinuity $Ω_ρ\subset G/H$, where $H$ is a parabolic or symmetric subgroup. In this paper, we extend the properly discontinuous $Γ$-action via $ρ$ to the space of connections on the pullbacks of the tangent bundle over $Ω_ρ$. When $Ω_ρ$ is a complex curve, we show that the $Γ$-action is properly discontinuous on the union of Higgs bundle structures associated with the $(1,0)$ part of the complexified pullback bundles. We further construct a free abelian group $F^{ab}$ generated by these holomorphic line bundles and induce a topoogical structure on it, so that $ρ(Γ)$ acts properly discontinuously on $F^{ab} \setminus \{\mathrm{id}\}$. This free abelian group is well-defined up to isomorphism over the character variety of Zariski dense Anosov representations. Finally, we endow the space of Anosov representations with a categorical structure compatible with $Ω_ρ$ and construct a natural functor to the category of abelian groups.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Andrew Fisher, Daniel Graves &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 12 pages, final version to appear in Extracta Mathematicae

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study the (co)homology of Tanabe algebras, which are a family of subalgebras of the partition algebras exhibiting a Schur-Weyl duality with certain complex reflection groups. The homology of the partition algebras has been shown to be related to the homology of the symmetric groups by Boyd-Hepworth-Patzt and the results they obtain depend on a parameter. In all known results, the homology of a diagram algebra is dependent on one of two things: the invertibility of a parameter in the ground ring or the parity of the positive integer indexing the number of pairs of vertices. We show that the (co)homology of Tanabe algebras is isomorphic to the (co)homology of the symmetric groups and that this is independent of both the parameter and the parity of the index. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a result of this sort. Along the way we will also study the (co)homology of the uniform block permutation algebra and the totally propagating partition algebra as well collecting cohomological analogues of known results for the homology of partition algebras and Jones annular algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We try to classify Hopf algebras with the dual Chevalley property of discrete corepresentation type over an algebraically closed field $\Bbb{k}$ with characteristic 0. For such Hopf algebra $H$, we characterize the link quiver of $H$ and determine the structures of the link-indecomposable component $H_{(1)}$ containing $\Bbb{k}1$. Besides, we construct an infinite-dimensional non-pointed non-cosemisimple link-indecomposable Hopf algebra $H(e_{\pm 1}, f_{\pm 1}, u, v)$ with the dual Chevalley property of discrete corepresentation type.</p></details>

We prove that $H$ is of finite corepresentation type if and only if it is coNakayama, if and only if the link quiver $\mathrm{Q}(H)$ of $H$ is a disjoint union of basic cycles, if and only if the link-indecomposable component $H_{(1)}$ containing $\Bbbk1$ is a pointed Hopf algebra and the link quiver of $H_{(1)}$ is a basic cycle.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Mihai Prunescu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct closed forms that generate with repetitions all Mersenne primes, respectively all Fermat primes, all twin-prime pairs and all Sophie Germain primes. Also, we construct closed forms that count all Mersenne primes between $0$ and $2^{n+2}-1$, respectively all Fermat primes between $0$ and $6n+5$ and all twin-prime pairs between $0$ and $n$. Every closed form is an arithmetic term, i. e. a fixed finite composition of the following arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division with remainder and the exponentiation $2^n$. While for generating these sets with repetitions, only Wilson's Theorem is applied, for the counting forms we use more specific tests, i.e. Lucas-Lehmer, respectively Pepin, and we apply to some extent Jones' work (see Acta Arithmetica XXXV, pg. 210 - 221, 1979). To count twin primes we apply Clement's Theorem, which is closely related to Wilson's. A closed form to count the Sophie Germain primes can be constructed similarly.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine subnormalisers of semisimple elements of prime power order in finite quasi-simple groups of Lie type. For this, we determine the maximal overgroups of normalisers of Sylow tori. This is motivated by the recent character correspondence conjecture by Moretó and Rizo as well as by the question of existence of quasi-semiregular elements in finite permutation groups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 11 pages. This is the TheoretiCS journal version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For almost a century, the decidability of the Skolem Problem - that is, the problem of finding whether a given linear recurrence sequence (LRS) has a zero term - has remained open. A breakthrough in the 1980s established that the Skolem Problem is indeed decidable for algebraic LRS of order at most 3, and real algebraic LRS of order at most 4. However, for general algebraic LRS of order 4 the question of decidability has remained open. Our main contribution in this paper is to prove decidability for this last case, i.e. we show that the Skolem Problem is decidable for all algebraic LRS of order at most 4.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 155 pages,

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present the first algorithm for computing class groups and unit groups of arbitrary number fields that provably runs in probabilistic subexponential time, assuming the Extended Riemann Hypothesis (ERH). Previous subexponential algorithms were either restricted to imaginary quadratic fields, or relied on several heuristic assumptions that have long resisted rigorous analysis. The heart of our method is a new general strategy to provably solve a recurring computational problem in number theory (assuming ERH): given an ideal class $[\mathfrak{a}]$ of a number field $K$, sample an ideal $\mathfrak b \in [\mathfrak{a}]$ belonging to a particular family of ideals (e.g., the family of smooth ideals, or near-prime ideals). More precisely, let $\mathcal{S}$ be an arbitrary family of ideals, and $\mathcal{S}_B$ the family of $B$-smooth ideals. We describe an efficient algorithm that samples ideals $\mathfrak b \in [\mathfrak{a}]$ such that $\mathfrak b \in \mathcal{S} \cdot\mathcal{S}_B$ with probability proportional to the density of $\mathcal{S}$ within the set of all ideals. The case where $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of prime ideals yields the family $\mathcal{S}\cdot\mathcal{S}_B$ of near-prime ideals, of particular interest in that it constitutes a dense family of efficiently factorable ideals. The case of smooth ideals $\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{S}_B$ regularly comes up in index-calculus algorithms (notably to compute class groups and unit groups), where it has long constituted a theoretical obstacle overcome only by heuristic arguments.</p></details>

> **Comment:** A fairly significant reworking of the paper, introducing non-backtracking operators. This simplifies the argument and fixes an issue in Lemma C.1 of version 1. 66 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $λ$ be the Liouville function, defined as $λ(n) := (-1)^{Ω(n)}$ where $Ω(n)$ is the number of prime factors of $n$ with multiplicity. In 2021, Helfgott and Radziwiłł proved that $$\sum_{n\leq x} \frac{1}{n} λ(n) λ(n+1) \ll \frac{\log x}{(\log \log x)^{1/2}},$$improving earlier results by Tao and Teräväinen. We prove that $$\sum_{n\leq x} \frac{1}{n} λ(n) λ(n+1) \ll (\log x)^{1-c}$$for some absolute constant $c>0$. This appears to be best possible with current methods.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study modules over a generalized Weyl algebra $R(σ,a)$ which are free when restricted to the base ring $R$. When $R$ is an integral domain, we construct all such finite-rank modules up to isomorphism, leading to new simple modules over a variety of algebras. In particular, we show that free modules that have rank $1$ over $R$ can be parametrized as $V_{\mathsf{p}}$ where $\mathsf{p}$ is a divisor of $a$. We give simplicity criteria for $V_{\mathsf{p}}$ and, additionally, when $R$ is a PID, provide a complete combinatorial description of the submodule structure of $V_{\mathsf{p}}$ and of the weight modules occurring as subquotients. We also show that, under some mild conditions on $R(σ,a)$, there exist simple $R$-free modules of arbitrary finite rank. We apply our results to $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ in order to construct new families of simple Cartan-free modules of all finite ranks.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prime-encode the natural numbers via recursive factorisation, iterated to the exponents, generating a corpus of planar rooted trees equivalently represented as Dyck words. This forms a deterministic text endowed with internal rules. Statistical analysis of the corpus reveals that the dictionary and the entropy grow sublinearly, compression shows non-monotonic trend, and the rank-frequency curves assume a stable parabolic form deviating from Zipf's law. Correlation analysis using mean-squared displacement reveals a transition from normal diffusion to superdiffusion in the associated walk. These findings characterise the tree-encoded sequence as a statistically structured text with long-range correlations grounded in its generative arithmetic law, providing an empirical basis for subsequent theoretical and learnability</p></details>

In addition, we consider Frobenius Schur indicators of modules over the Drinfeld doubles of finite reductive groups. In the final section, we study the multiplicities of tensor products of almost unipotent characters and pose the question of whether their non vanishing can be detected through the multiplicities of tensor products of irreducible characters of the Weyl group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Chevalley group schemes are group schemes defined over the integers that parametrize connected reductive groups over algebraically closed fields as geometric fibers. In this paper, we construct closed subgroup schemes of Chevalley group schemes that parametrize symmetric subgroups of reductive groups as geometric fibers. Our construction relies crucially on the theory of quantum symmetric pairs and thus naturally admits a quantization. At the quantum level, this leads to the construction of coisotropic quantum right subgroups of the quantized function algebras of reductive groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For primes $p$ and $\ell$ such that $\ell$ divides $p-1$, Hirano and Morishita constructed a nonabelian Galois extension of the function field $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$ whose degree is $\ell^3$ and Galois group is of Heisenberg type. Here we analyze how primes of degree one decompose in such extensions. It amounts to investigating the decomposition of the principal ideal $(t-a)$ for $a \in \mathbb{F}_p-\{0,1\}$ and our main result determines when it decomposes completely in terms of an explicit polynomial in $a$. It is reminiscent of Euler's criterion. The proof relies on both the group structure of the mod-$\ell$ Heisenberg group and the arithmetic of field extensions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a uniform construction of "mixed versions" or "graded lifts" in the sense of Beilinson-Ginzburg-Soergel which works for arbitrary Artin stacks. In particular, we obtain a general construction of graded lifts of many categories arising in geometric representation theory and categorified knot invariants. Our new theory associates to each Artin stack of finite type $\mathcal{Y}$ over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q$ a symmetric monoidal DG-category $\mathsf{Shv}_{\mathsf{gr}, c}(\mathcal{Y})$ of constructible graded sheaves on $\mathcal{Y}$ along with the six-functor formalism, a perverse $t$-structure, and a weight (or co-$t$-)structure in the sense of Bondarko and Pauksztello, compatible with the six-functor formalism, perverse $t$-structures, and Frobenius weights on the category of (mixed) $\ell$-adic sheaves. Classically, mixed versions were only constructed in very special cases due to the non-semisimplicity of Frobenius. Our construction sidesteps this issue by semi-simplifying the Frobenius action itself. However, the category $\mathsf{Shv}_{\mathsf{gr}, c}(\mathcal{Y})$ agrees with those previously constructed when they are available. For example, for any reductive group $G$ with a fixed pair $T\subset B$ of a maximal torus and a Borel subgroup, we have an equivalence of monoidal DG weight categories $\mathsf{Shv}_{\mathsf{gr}, c}(B\backslash G/B) \simeq \mathsf{Ch}^b(\mathsf{SBim}_W)$, where $\mathsf{Ch}^b(\mathsf{SBim}_W)$ is the monoidal $\mathsf{DG}$-category of bounded chain complexes of Soergel bimodules and $W$ is the Weyl group of $G$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The theory of normality for base $g$ expansions of real numbers in $[0,1)$ is rich and well developed. Similar theories have been developed for many other numeration systems, such as the regular continued fraction expansion, $β$-expansions, and Lüroth series expansions. Let $Q=(q_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of integers greater than or equal to 2. The $Q$-Cantor series expansion of $x \in [0,1)$ is the unique sum of the form $x=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x_n}{q_1q_2\cdots q_n}$, where $x_n \neq q_n-1$ infinitely often. For the Cantor series expansions, most of the literature thus far considers $Q$ where the theory of normality differs drastically from that of the base $g$ expansions. We introduce the class of dynamically generated Cantor series expansions, which is a large class of Cantor series expansions for which much of the classical theory of base $g$ expansions can be developed in parallel. This class includes many examples such as the Thue-Morse sequence on $\{2,3\}$ and translated Champernowne numbers. A special case of our main results is that if $Q$ is a bounded basic sequence that is dynamically generated by an ergodic system having zero entropy, then normality base $Q$ coincides with distribution normality base $Q$, and $Q$ possesses a Hot Spot Theorem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We answer several questions of Erdős regarding sequences of natural numbers $A$ whose translates $n+A$ intersect with the squarefree numbers in various specified ways. For instance, we show that if every translate only contains finitely many squarefree numbers, then $A$ has zero density, although the decay rate of this density can be arbitrarily slow. On the other hand, there exist sequences $A$ with optimal density $6/π^2$ for which infinitely many $n$ exist such that $n+a$ is squarefree for all $a \in A$ with $a < n$. In fact, infinitely many such $n$ exist for every exponentially increasing sequence, as long as the sequence avoids at least one residue class modulo $p^2$ for all primes $p$, a property we call admissible. If one instead requires infinitely many $n$ to exist such that $n+a$ is squarefree for all $a \in A$, then $A$ can have density arbitrarily close to, but not equal to, $6/π^2$. Finally, we prove bounds on the growth rate of sequences $A$ for which $a+a'$ is squarefree for all $a,a' \in A$, as well as bounds on the largest admissible subset of $\{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We completely classify Laurent series converging on the unit circle over a non-Archimedean local field (of any characteristic) that map infinitely many roots of unity to roots of unity. For a given Laurent series $f$ over a field of positive characteristic with residue field $\mathbb{F}_q$, we prove effective bounds for the number of possible roots of unity in terms of the number of zeroes of the auxilliary function $f(x^q) -f(x)^q$. In characteristic $0$ our bound is still effective but also depends on the ramification degree of the base field over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ as well as the size of the coefficients of $f$. This has applications to the Manin-Mumford conjecture in $\mathbb{G}_m^2$. In characteristic $0$, this work builds upon a pigeon-hole based method by Schmidt.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A field $K$ is $d$-local if there exist fields $K=k_d,...,k_0$ with $k_{i+1}$ complete discrete valuation with residue field $k_i$, and $k_0$ finite of characteristic $p$. By work of Deninger and Wingberg, the Galois cohomology of such fields with finite coefficients satisfies a duality generalizing Tate duality when either $d=0$, $\mathrm{char} k_1=0$ or the coefficients have no $p$-torsion. Reviewing and synthesizing results of Suzuki and Kato, we obtain $p$-torsion duality statements under the weaker assumption that either $d\leq 1$ or $\mathrm{char} k_2=0$, as well as for varieties over $K$, where duality is stated in terms of locally compact Hausdorff topologies on the étale cohomology groups. More generally we obtain results for any perfect $k_0$, endowing the totally unramified cohomology groups of $K$ with the structure of ind-pro-quasi-algebraic $k_0$-groups.</p></details>

In this paper, we achieve multiple goals: (\textbf{A}) establish the implication $\mathrm{MT}_p\Leftrightarrow \mathrm{logAL}_p \Rightarrow \mathrm{geoAO_p}$, and show that they all follow from the Tate conjecture for abelian varieties. The equivalence $\mathrm{MT}_p\Leftrightarrow \mathrm{logAL}_p$ is exploited from both sides, which enables us to \noindent(\textbf{B}) develop a representation theory approach to $\mathrm{logAL}_p$ and $\mathrm{geoAO_p}$ by first establishing many cases of MT$_p$ via classical techniques, and (\textbf{C}) develop an algebraization approach to $\MTT_p$ that transcends the limitation of classical methods. In particular, we introduce ``crystalline Hodge loci'', a rigid analytic geometric object that encodes the essential information needed for proving $\mathrm{logAL}_p$, while being very approachable via (integral and relative) $p$-adic Hodge theory. This enables us to prove $\mathrm{logAL}_p$ for compact Tate-linear curves with unramified $p$-adic monodromy. As an application, we establish $\MTT_p$ for many abelian fourfolds of $p$-adic Mumford type.</p></details>

In this article, we prove that Zywina's conjecture is true for the family of non-CM elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ that admit a nontrivial rational cyclic isogeny. This strengthens a result of Lemos that resolved Serre's uniformity question for the same family of curves. Our proof proceeds by analyzing a collection of modular curves associated with each prime isogeny degree, using recent advances on $\ell$-adic images, isogeny-torsion graphs, and computations of models and rational points.</p></details>

> **Comment:** We do not address the global open problem of non-trivial solutions to a^k+b^k=c^k+d^k for k>4 without linear constraints

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Diophantine equation $a^k + b^k = c^k + d^k$ with integer variables and exponent $k>1$, under the linear constraint $(c+d) - (a+b) = h$. We analyze the geometry and arithmetic of these ``linear slices.'' On the central slice $h=0$, we prove strictly convex uniqueness: distinct unordered pairs with the same sum yield distinct power sums. For shifted slices $h\neq 0$, we establish a Modular Divisibility Obstruction (MDO): any solution requires $h$ to be divisible by a specific squarefree modulus $M_k = \prod_{p-1 \mid k-1} p$. This condition creates a strong divisibility filter; for example, if $k=13$, the obstruction eliminates $99.96\%$ of all possible shifts. We combine this arithmetic constraint with a geometric exclusion zone principle and a global overlap bound, showing that the slice size must satisfy $\min\{S, S+h\} \gg |h|$. Finally, we prove an asymptotic dominance bound $k \le \max\{S, S+h\} \log 2$, implying that for any fixed slice, solutions cannot exist for sufficiently large $k$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is mainly concerned with the disk of convergence of a power series s(x) representing an algebraic function of x and specifically with the relation between this disk and the branch points of the function. We shall focus especially on the p-adic case, answering some questions of basic nature, seemingly absent from the existing literature. Our methods are simple and essentially self-contained. To illustrate the issues, recall that in the complex case it follows from standard arguments that the open disk of convergence cannot contain all the branch points of x unless the series represents a rational function. In the p-adic case, we show that the analogous assertion is not true in complete generality; but we also confirm it in a number of cases, for instance under the assumption that p is not smaller than the degree of s(x) over the field of rational functions of x. In particular this gives an upper bound for the radius of convergence which has intrinsic nature. We shall also touch several related questions.</p></details>

New Proof of Theorem 1 (Rogers-Ramanujan) using only monodromy analytic continuation, addressing a referee concern about the earlier use of Eisenstein series and the spirit of the problem. The general Theorem 2 (which also covers Theorem 1) already used only monodromy analytic continuation to derive modularity

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1975, G. E. Andrews challenged the mathematics community to address L. Ehrenpreis' problem, which was to directly prove the modularity of the Rogers-Ramanujan $q$-series' summatory forms. This question is important because many different $q$-series appearing in combinatorics, representation theory, and physics often seem to be mysteriously modular, yet there is no general test to confirm this directly from the exotic $q$-series expressions. In this note, we answer the challenge. We use $q$-series algebra, first-order $q$-differential systems, and analytic continuation with monodromy to give a criterion that decides when such series are modular. Specifically, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a vector of holomorphic $q$-series on $|q|<1$ to form a vector-valued modular function without modular input, providing a clear path to modularity for strange $q$-series.</p></details>

Then there exist infinitely many odd and square-free (and thus fundamental) integers $m$ such that $m=\mathrm{discriminant}(T)$ and $A(F,T)\neq 0$. In the case of odd degrees, we prove a stronger result by replacing odd and square-free with odd and prime. We also prove quantitative results towards this.

Focusing on real biquadratic fields $K=\mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{d_1},\sqrt{d_2}\right)$ with $2\nmid d_1d_2$, we prove that if the class group $\mathrm{Cl}_K$ is cyclic and the Hilbert class field $H(K)$ is abelian over $\mathbb{Q}$, then $K$ contains a Euclidean ideal class (unconditionally). We also analyse the distribution of genus numbers in a natural family of biquadratic fields and, using these statistics, show that the set of biquadratic fields admitting a Euclidean ideal has density zero.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $q=p^f$ be a prime power and let $H$ be a classical group of type $A$, so $H \cong \mathrm{SL}_d(q)$ or $\mathrm{GL}_d(q)$, acting on its natural module $V$ of dimension $d$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Let $W$ be an absolutely irreducible $\mathbb{F}_qH$--module such that, over an algebraic closure, $W$ is isomorphic (up to Frobenius twists) to a tensor product $\bigotimes_{t=1}^r L(λ^{(t)})$, where each $L(λ^{(t)})$ is an irreducible polynomial representation of $\mathrm{GL}_d$ of degree $k_t$, and the total degree $K=\sum_t k_t$ satisfies $K<q-1$. We prove a base-$q$ injectivity lemma which shows that, for a Singer cycle $s \in H$, the eigenvalues of $s$ on $W \otimes_{\mathbb{F}_q} \mathbb{F}_{q^d}$ are parametrised by digit vectors of length $d$ with entries bounded by $K$. In particular, distinct weights of $W$ correspond to distinct eigenvalues. If in addition $W$ is multiplicity-free for the diagonal torus of $\mathrm{GL}_d$, then every eigenspace of $s$ is one-dimensional, so $s$ has a simple spectrum on $W$. Using this spectral property we design a Las Vegas rewriting algorithm which, given $G \leq \mathrm{GL}(W)$ isomorphic to $H$ and acting irreducibly on $W$, constructs a projective representation of $G$ of degree $d$ equivalent to the natural representation of $H$. The expected running time is polynomial in $d$, $\log q$ and $K$, and in the cost of field operations and discrete logarithm computations in $\mathbb{F}_{q^d}$. This extends earlier rewriting algorithms of Magaard--O'Brien--Seress and of Gül--Ankaralıoğlu to a broader class of twisted tensor products of polynomial modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Implicit models, an emerging model class, compute outputs by iterating a single parameter block to a fixed point. This architecture realizes an infinite-depth, weight-tied network that trains with constant memory, significantly reducing memory needs for the same level of performance compared to explicit models. While it is empirically known that these compact models can often match or even exceed the accuracy of larger explicit networks by allocating more test-time compute, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. We study this gap through a nonparametric analysis of expressive power. We provide a strict mathematical characterization, showing that a simple and regular implicit operator can, through iteration, progressively express more complex mappings. We prove that for a broad class of implicit models, this process lets the model's expressive power scale with test-time compute, ultimately matching a much richer function class. The theory is validated across four domains: image reconstruction, scientific computing, operations research, and LLM reasoning, demonstrating that as test-time iterations increase, the complexity of the learned mapping rises, while the solution quality simultaneously improves and stabilizes.</p></details>

We will focus on the extension of the action of $G$ on this compactification by characterising the set $\mathcal{U} \subset X^\urcorner$ where the action is well defined. We will also show that the quotient of $\mathcal{U}$ by the action of $G$ is homeomorphic to $(X/G)^\urcorner$, the compactification of $(X/G)(\mathbb{C})$. We then apply these results to $X = \mathrm{Rat}_d$, the space of rational maps and $G = \mathrm{SL}_2$. It gives the results of C. Favre-C. Gong in a more general setting. Furthermore, we get a compactification of $\mathrm{M}_d = \mathrm{Rat}_d/\mathrm{SL}_2$ where the boundary is made of orbits of non-archimedean rational maps. The results still holds if $\mathbb{C}$ is replaced by $k$ a non-trivially valued field and complex analytic spaces by Berkovich spaces over $k$.</p></details>

Braverman, Kazhdan and Ngô conjectured that one has a Schwartz space $\mathcal{S}_ρ(G(F))$ of functions on $G(F)$ that admits a Fourier transform and satisfies certain desiderata. We prove a large portion of this conjecture. More precisely, we construct these Schwartz spaces over non-Archimedean local fields and construct an approximation to them over Archimedean fields. Our methods are spectral in nature.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove Breuil's lattice conjecture for higher Hodge-Tate weights in the case of $\mathrm{GL}_2(K)$ where $K$ is an unramified extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. More precisely, under some genericity conditions, we show that the lattice inside a locally algebraic type induced by the completed cohomology of a $U(2)$-arithmetic manifold depends only on the Galois representation at places above $p$ for arbitrary Hodge-Tate weights, which are small relative to $p$. We further prove that the patched modules of all lattices inside the locally algebraic types with irreducible cosocle are cyclic. One key input of the paper is a structure theorem for mod $p$ representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathcal{O}_K)$, which are residually multiplicity free and of finite length. Another input is an explicit computation of universal framed Galois deformation rings, which parameterize potentially crystalline lifts with fixed tame inertial types and higher Hodge-Tate weights.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Jarossay (arXiv math.NT1412.5099) introduced adjoint multiple zeta values and, by using Racinet's dual formulation of the generating series of multiple zeta values, found $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic relations among them, referred to as the \textit{adjoint double shuffle relations}. Additionally, Jarossay defined the affine scheme $\mathrm{AdDMR}_0$ determined by the adjoint double shuffle relations and posed a question whether $\mathrm{AdDMR}_0$ is isomorphic to Racinet's double shuffle group $\mathrm{DMR}_0$ (Publ. Math. Inst. Hautes Études Sci. (2002), no. 95). In this paper, we refine Jarossay's question by introducing the condition referred to as the adjoint conditions, and, based on this refinement, we study the corresponding Lie algebraic aspect. Within this framework, we construct the Lie algebra associated with the adjoint double shuffle relations by imposing Hirose's parity results.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is conjectured that the Markoff equation $X^2+Y^2+Z^2=3XYZ$ satisfies the special Diophantine property that every mod $p$ solution lifts to an integer solution. Progress toward this conjecture has been made by studying the connectedness of the graphs obtained from the action of the Vieta group on the nonzero mod $p$ solutions to the Markoff equation. In this paper, we use results on Pisano periods of the Fibonacci sequence to obtain explicit results on the connectedness of special points in this graph for primes $p$ where $p+1$ has large $2$-adic valuation. In particular, for Mersenne primes $p \equiv \pm 2 \,(\text{mod}\, 5)$, we show that the special point $(1, 1, 1)$ which is fixed under reduction modulo $p$ lies in a component of this graph which is known to be connected.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a general theory of cluster categories, applying to a 2-Calabi-Yau extriangulated category $\mathcal{C}$ and cluster-tilting subcategory $\mathcal{T}$ satisfying only mild finiteness conditions. We show that the structure theory of $\mathcal{C}$ and the representation theory of $\mathcal{T}$ give rise to the rich combinatorial structures of seed data and cluster ensembles, via Grothendieck groups and homological algebra. We demonstrate that there is a natural dictionary relating cluster-tilting subcategories and their tilting theory to A-side tropical cluster combinatorics and, dually, relating modules over $\underline{\mathcal{T}}$ to the X-side; here $\underline{\mathcal{T}}$ is the image of $\mathcal{T}$ in the triangulated stable category of $\mathcal{C}$. Moreover, the exchange matrix associated to $\mathcal{T}$ arises from a natural map $p_{\mathcal{T}}\colon\mathrm{K}_0(\mathrm{mod}\underline{\mathcal{T}})\to\mathrm{K}_0(\mathcal{T})$ closely related to taking projective resolutions. Via our approach, we categorify many key identities involving mutation, g-vectors and c-vectors, including in infinite rank cases and in the presence of loops and 2-cycles. We are also able to define A- and X-cluster characters, which yield A- and X-cluster variables when there are no loops or 2-cycles, and which enable representation-theoretic proofs of cluster-theoretical statements. Continuing with the same categorical philosophy, we give a definition of a quantum cluster category, as a cluster category together with the choice of a map closely related to the adjoint of $p_{\mathcal{T}}$. Our framework enables us to show that any Hom-finite exact cluster category admits a canonical quantum structure, generalising results of Geiß--Leclerc--Schröer.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a real distribution $\mathcal{D}$ on the interval $[0,L]$ with $\tilde{\mathcal{ D}}$ the associated even distribution on the interval $[-L, L]$, we prove that if the associated quadratic form with Schwartz kernel $\tilde{\mathcal{D}}(x - y)$ defines a lower-bounded selfadjoint operator on $L^2([-\frac{L}{2}, \frac{L}{2}])$, whose lowest spectral value $λ$ is a simple, isolated eigenvalue with even eigenfunction $ξ$, then all the zeros of the entire function $\widehat ξ(z)$, the Fourier transform of $ξ$, lie on the real line. The proof proceeds in five steps. (1) We give a C*-algebraic proof of a corollary of Carathéodory-Fejér's 1911 structure Theorem for Toeplitz matrices: if $T \in M_n(\mathbb{C})$ is a Hermitian, positive semidefinite Toeplitz matrix of rank $n - 1$, and $ξ\in \ker T$, then the polynomial $P(z) = \sum ξ_j z^j$ has all its zeros on the unit circle. (2) We formulate and prove a continuous analogue of this result, replacing the Toeplitz matrix with a convolution operator with continuous kernel $h(x - y)$, and the polynomial $P(z)$ with the Fourier transform of the eigenfunction corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. (3) We analyze finite-dimensional truncations of the quadratic forms defined by real, even distributions $\mathcal{D}$ on $[-L, L]$, and observe that the resulting matrices exhibit a structure previously encountered in perturbative expansions of the spectral action. (4) We establish an analogue of Carathéodory-Fejér's corollary for matrices of this specific structure, thereby extending the zero localization result beyond the classical Toeplitz setting. (5) Finally, we apply a classical theorem of Hurwitz concerning the zeros of uniform limits of holomorphic functions to deduce the general result stated above.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a new quadratic Chabauty method to compute the integral points on certain even degree hyperelliptic curves. Our approach relies on a nontrivial degree zero divisor supported at the two points at infinity to restrict the $p$-adic height to a linear function; we can then express this restriction in terms of holomorphic Coleman integrals under the standard quadratic Chabauty assumption. Then we use this linear relation to extract the integral points on the curve. We also generalize our method to integral points over number fields. Our method is significantly simpler and faster than all other existing versions of the quadratic Chabauty method. We give examples over $\Q$ and $\Q(\sqrt{7})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1973, Calderón proved that an $m \times 2$ positive semidefinite (psd) biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of ${3m(m+1) \over 2}$ squares of quadratic forms. Very recently, by applying Hilbert's theorem on ternary quartics, we proved that a $2 \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of three squares of bilinear forms. This improved Calderón's result for $m=2$, and left the sos (sum-of-squares) rank problem of $m \times 2$ biquadratic forms for $m \ge 3$ to further exploration. In this paper, we show that an $3 \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as four squares of bilinear forms. We make a conjecture that an $m \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as $m+1$ squares of bilinear forms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Trades are important objects in combinatorial design theory that may be realized as certain elements of kernels of inclusion matrices. Total trades were introduced recently by Ghorbani, Kamali and Khosravshahi, who showed that over a field of characteristic zero the vector space of trades decomposes into a direct sum of spaces of total trades. In this paper, we show that the vector space spanned by the permutations of a total trade is an irreducible representation of the symmetric group. As a corollary, the previous decomposition theorem is recovered. Also, a basis is obtained for the module of total trades in the spirit of Specht polynomials. More generally, in the second part of the paper we consider intersection matrices and determine the irreducible decompositions of their images. This generalizes previously known results concerning ranks of special cases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study abstract dynamical systems with discrete phase spaces. One example of such a system is induced by the $3 x{+}1$-map on the set of all natural numbers, also known as the Collatz map. Our main focus is on dynamical systems induced by maps on countable discrete sets that satisfy a bounded condition. When these maps satisfy the bounded and a separating conditions, a minimality of the induced dynamical systems is equivalent to the irreducibility of certain $C^{*}$-algebras on certain Hilbert spaces. For a map $f$ on a general discrete phase space, we consider $f$-invariant sets and investigate their properties. When the phase space is countable and the map satisfies the bounded condition, we construct an order-preserving injection from the family of $f$-invariant sets to the family of reducing subspaces for the corresponding $C^{*}$-algebra. By introducing the totally uniqueness condition for $f$, we show that this injection is a bijection if $f$ satisfies this condition. This condition is crucial in providing a symbolic representation of the dynamical system induced by $f$, and we discuss the relationship between this symbolic representation and that of a topological dynamical system.</p></details>

When $p\equiv 3 \mod 4$, it is easy to see that $f(X)=X^{\frac{p+1}{4}}$ is the smallest such polynomial. For $p\equiv 1 \mod 4$, the situation is less clear. Tonelli-Shanks offers an algorithm for constructing polynomials that compute square roots, but the question of whether their degree is minimal remains. In this paper, we study the various degrees and structures of polynomials computing square roots.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a local-global principle for representations of binary by quaternary quadratic forms. One of the main ingredients is a recent measure rigidity result of Einsiedler and Lindenstrauss for diagonalizable actions on quotients of products of $\mathrm{SL}_2$'s. Based on this, it suffices to show that limits of the uniform measures on the associated rank one adelic toral packets have more entropy than one half of the maximal entropy. The latter is proved using the Siegel mass formula and the determinant method as developed by Bombieri and Pila as well as Heath-Brown.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is well known that tau functions of the KP hierarchy satisfy addition formulas. We consider the general addition formula in the determinant form and take a certain limit of it. It expresses certain shifts of a tau function in terms of the Wronskian determinants of wave functions at various values of the spectral parameter. As an application the relation between solutions created by vertex operators and those created by Darboux transformations is clarified. As another application the new addition formula for Riemann's theta functions of Riemann surfaces is obtained by considering theta function solutions of the KP hierarchy. This addition formula is different from any of formulas in Fay's book.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Version 8 corrects Definition 5.4 (integral operator), which was ill-defined in Version 7. The regularization procedure now properly accounts for boundary identifications of the fundamental domain

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper constructs weight-shifting integral operators for Maass forms on the full modular group SL(2,Z). Under the weight parity condition t = k (mod 2), the operator utilizes an automorphic kernel constructed via Poincare series from a seed kernel. The seed kernel is defined as the product of a covariant factor and an invariant factor with respect to the diagonal action of SL(2,R). A spectral condition is imposed that the kernel must be an eigenfunction of the weight-t hyperbolic Laplacian. This problem reduces to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the invariant factor, which is identified as a Papperitz-Riemann equation. By transforming this equation into the Gauss Hypergeometric Differential Equation (HDE), the hypergeometric type of the operator is established. Analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the hypergeometric solutions yields the convergence conditions for the automorphic kernel and the integral operator, requiring the selection of the subdominant solution. The operator is defined via regularization based on the Hyperbolic Cauchy Principal Value to handle the diagonal singularities of the kernel. The automorphy of the transformed function is verified under the assumption of absolute convergence. A necessary condition for the intertwining property, namely the coincidence of the kernel's spectral parameter and the input Maass form's Laplacian eigenvalue, is conditionally derived. Analysis of the smoothness and the behavior at the cusp of the transformed function is deferred to subsequent research. Finally, the relevance of the hypergeometric structure to Hecke algebra compatibility and motivic interpretation is discussed.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>While Kronecker coefficients $g(λ,μ,ν)$ with bounded rows are polynomial-time computable via lattice-point methods, no explicit closed-form formulas have been obtained for genuinely three-row cases in the 87 years since Murnaghan's foundational work. This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse. We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge. We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \mod 2)$ for all $n \geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Admissible chains of i-boxes are important combinatorial tools in the monoidal categorification of cluster algebras, as they provide seeds of the cluster algebra. In this paper, we explore the properties of maximal commuting families of i-boxes in a more general setting, and define a certain matrix associated with such a family, which we call the exchange matrix. It turns out that, when considering the cluster algebra structure on the Grothendieck rings, this matrix is indeed the exchange matrix of the seed associated with the family, both in certain categories of modules over quantum affine algebras and over quiver Hecke algebras. We prove this by constructing explicit short exact sequences that represent the mutation relations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the Smith forms of the powers of an integer square matrix behave in an eventually periodic manner. More precisely, if $\mathrm{SF}(M)$ denotes the Smith form of $M \in \Z^{m \times m}$, then for every $A \in \Z^{m \times m}$ there exist $n_0 \in \N$, an integer $T \geq 1$, and a constant diagonal matrix $D \in \Z^{m \times m}$ such that $n \geq n_0$ implies $\mathrm{SF}(A^{n+T})=D \cdot \mathrm{SF}(A^n)$. This provides an eventually affirmative answer to a conjecture posed in 2013 by R. Bruner. We also show that both $n_0$ and $T$ can be arbitrarily large.</p></details>
