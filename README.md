 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Le Quang Ham, Do Trong Hoang, Le Quang Hung, Doowon Koh, Thang Pham &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $d\ge3$ and $\mathbb{F}_q^{\,d}$ be the $d$-dimensional vector space over a finite field of order $q$, where $q$ is an odd prime power. Let $X_π$ be the set of lines through the origin intersecting the slice $π\cap S^{d-1}$, where $π=\{x_d=λ\}$ and $S^{d-1}=\{x:\|x\|=1\}$. For $E\subset\mathbb{F}_q^{\,d}$ and $N\ge1$, we study the exceptional sets $$ T_1(X_π,E,N)=\bigl\{V\in X_π:\ |π_V(E)|\le N\bigr\},\qquad T_2(X_π,E,N)=\bigl\{V\in X_π:\ |π_{V^\perp}(E)|\le N\bigr\}, $$ with their respective natural ranges of $N$. Using discrete Fourier analysis together with restriction/extension estimates for cone and sphere-type quadrics over finite fields, we obtain sharp upper bounds (up to constant factors) for $\lvert T_1\rvert$ and $\lvert T_2\rvert$, with separate analyses for the cases $λ\in \{0, \pm 1\}$. The bounds exhibit arithmetic-geometric dichotomies absent in the full Grassmannian: the quadratic character of $λ^{2}-1$ and the parity of $d$ determine the size of the exceptional sets. As an application, when $|E|\ge q$, there exists a positive proportion of elements $\mathbf{y}\in π\cap S^{d-1}$ such that the pinned dot-product sets $\{\mathbf{y}\cdot \mathbf{x}\colon \mathbf{x}\in E\}$ have cardinality $Ω(q)$. We further study analogous families arising from the spheres of radii $0$ and $-1$, and, by combining the results, recover the known estimates for projections over the full Grassmannian, complementing a result of Chen (2018).</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Barry Brent &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Ten pages, three figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study matrices the determinants of which represent $τ(p_n)$, where $τ$ is Ramanujan's function and $p_n$ denotes the $n^{th} rational prime. We also look at certain ``deformations'' of these matrices that exhibit nice regularities within the limited range of our empirical observations. This is an application of methods from our previous article arXiv:math/0405083.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 36 pages, updated bibliography, certain proofs are now more detailed, other minor changes (such as correction of typos)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish the analogue of Khintchine's theorem for all self-similar probability measures on the real line. When specified to the case of the Hausdorff measure on the middle-thirds Cantor set, the result is already new and provides an answer to an old question of Mahler. The proof consists in showing effective equidistribution in law of expanding upper-triangular random walks on $\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{R})/\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$, a result of independent interest.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 43 pages, 2 figures. Comments welcome! v2: some results generalised, exposition improved

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Reflexive dg categories were introduced by Kuznetsov and Shinder to abstract the duality between bounded and perfect derived categories. In particular this duality relates their Hochschild cohomologies, autoequivalence groups, and semiorthogonal decompositions. We establish reflexivity in a variety of settings including affine schemes, simple-minded collections, chain and cochain dg algebras of topological spaces, Ginzburg dg algebras, and Fukaya categories of cotangent bundles and surfaces as well as the closely related class of graded gentle algebras. Our proofs are based on the interplay of reflexivity with gluings, derived completions, and Koszul duality. In particular we show that for certain (co)connective dg algebras, reflexivity is equivalent to derived completeness.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nuno Freitas, Diana Mocanu, Ignasi Sanchez-Rodriguez &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbb Q$ be an elliptic curve and $p \geq 3$ a prime. The modular curve $X_E^-(p)$ parameterizes elliptic curves with $p$-torsion modules anti-symplectically isomorphic to $E[p]$. The work of Freitas--Naskręcki--Stoll uses the modular method to show that all primitive non-trivial solutions of the Fermat-type equation $x^2 + y^3 = z^p$ give rise to rational points on $X_E^-(p)$ with $E \in \{27a1,54a1,96a1,288a1,864a1,864b1,864c1 \}$. Using a criterion classifying the existence of local points due to the first two authors, we show that, for $E$ any of the curves with conductor 864 and certain primes $p \equiv 19 \pmod{24}$, we have $X_E^-(p)(\mathbb Q_\ell) = \emptyset$. Furthermore, for each $E$ in the list and any $p$, we prove that either $X_E^-(p)$ can be discarded using the same criterion, or it cannot be discarded using purely local information.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show the de Jong fundamental group of any non-trivial abelian variety over a complete algebraically closed extension $C/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is non-abelian. Generalizing an argument for $\mathbb{P}^1_C$, we also show the de Jong fundamental groups of positive-dimensional quasi-projective rigid analytic varieties over $C$ (including abelian varieties) depend on $C$ and can be arbitrarily large.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16450v2'>2404.16450</a>\]&nbsp; **Unconditional correctness of recent quantum algorithms for factoring and computing discrete logarithms**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Cédric Pilatte &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** To appear in Forum of Mathematics, Pi. Includes a new explanatory section. 25 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1994, Shor introduced his famous quantum algorithm to factor integers and compute discrete logarithms in polynomial time. In 2023, Regev proposed a multi-dimensional version of Shor's algorithm that requires far fewer quantum gates. His algorithm relies on a number-theoretic conjecture on the elements in $(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ that can be written as short products of very small prime numbers. We prove a version of this conjecture using tools from analytic number theory such as zero-density estimates. As a result, we obtain an unconditional proof of correctness of this improved quantum algorithm and of subsequent variants.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sean Howe &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 1 page (+ references) v2 - fixed typos, fixed "quasi-projective" in last remark

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $C/\mathbb{Q}_p$ a complete algebraically closed field, we construct a collection of non-isomorphic rank two $\mathbb{Q}_p$-local systems on $\mathbb{P}^1_C$ indexed by $C$. This implies that the de Jong fundamental group $π_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^1_C)$ depends on $C$ and, if $C$ has cardinality $>2^{\mathbb{N}}$, that $π_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^1_C)$ is not topologically countably generated. The argument in fact applies to any connected rigid analytic variety over $C$ with a non-constant function to $\mathbb{P}^1_C$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Elena Kim, Theresa C. Anderson, Robert J. Lemke Oliver &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AP &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 66 pages, 3 figures, with an appendix by Theresa C. Anderson and Robert J. Lemke Oliver. Revised according to the referee's comments. To appear in Analysis and PDE

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Quantum cat maps are toy models in quantum chaos associated to hyperbolic symplectic matrices $A\in \mathrm{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{Z})$. The macroscopic limits of sequences of eigenfunctions of a quantum cat map are characterized by semiclassical measures on the torus $\mathbb{R}^{2n}/\mathbb{Z}^{2n}$. We show that if the characteristic polynomial of every power $A^k$ is irreducible over the rationals, then every semiclassical measure has full support. The proof uses an earlier strategy of Dyatlov-Jézéquel [arXiv:2108.10463] and the higher-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle of Cohen [arXiv:2305.05022]. Our irreducibility condition is generically true, in fact we show that asymptotically for $100\%$ of matrices $A$, the Galois group of the characteristic polynomial of $A$ is $S_2 \wr S_n$. When the irreducibility condition does not hold, we show that a semiclassical measure cannot be supported on a finite union of parallel non-coisotropic subtori. On the other hand, we give examples of semiclassical measures supported on the union of two transversal symplectic subtori for $n=2$, inspired by the work of Faure-Nonnenmacher-De Bièvre [arXiv:nlin/0207060] in the case $n=1$. This is complementary to the examples by Kelmer [arXiv:math-ph/0510079] of semiclassical measures supported on a single coisotropic subtorus.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 47 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We initiate a general quantitative study of sets of $\mathcal{M}$-points, which are special subsets of rational points, generalizing Campana points, Darmon points, and squarefree solutions of Diophantine equations. We propose an asymptotic formula for the number of $\mathcal{M}$-points of bounded height on rationally connected varieties, extending Manin's conjecture as well as its generalization to Campana points by Pieropan, Smeets, Tanimoto and Várilly-Alvarado. Finally, we show that the conjecture explains several previously established results in arithmetic statistics.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the local rigidity of projective smooth horospherical varieties of rank one and Picard number two. These varieties have been already considered by the second author in a work where their automorphism groups are computed. The results given here are a natural continuation of this work.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10661v1'>2512.10661</a>\]&nbsp; **A purity theorem for Mahler equations**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Colin Faverjon, Julien Roques &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The principal aim of this paper is to establish a purity theorem for Mahler functions that is reminiscent of famous purity theorems for G-functions by D. and G. Chudnovsky and for E-functions (and, more generally, for holonomic arithmetic Gevrey series) by Y. Andr{é}. Our approach is based on a preliminary study of independent interest of the nature of the solutions of Mahler equations. Roughly speaking, we prove a reduction result for Mahler systems, implying that any Mahler equation admits a complete basis of solutions formed of what we call generalized Mahler series. These are sums involving Puiseux series, Hahn series of a very special type and solutions of inhomogeneous equations of order 1 with constant coefficients. In the light of B. Adamczewski, J. P. Bell and D. Smertnig's recent height gap theorem, we introduce a natural filtration on the set of generalized Mahler series according to the arithmetic growth of the coefficients of the Puiseux series involved in their decomposition. This filtration has five pieces. Our purity theorem states that the membership of a generalized Mahler series to one of the three largest pieces of this filtration propagates to any other generalized Mahler series solution of its minimal Mahler equation. We also show that this statement does not extend to the smallest two pieces.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 33 pages. Significant expansion of previous version, including generalization of main result to a larger class of examples. Also includes minor typo fixes. Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Beilinson-Bloch conjecture is a generalization of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, which relates the ranks of Chow groups of smooth projective varieties over global fields to the order of vanishing of $L$-functions. We prove the conjecture for certain classes of non-isotrivial varieties over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$, including some cubic threefolds. We deduce the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for their intermediate Jacobians, and use it to establish new cases of the Tate conjecture over finite fields. We also prove some additional results on the arithmetic of these intermediate Jacobians.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathrm{spt}(n)$ be the number of smallest parts in the partitions of $n$. In this paper, we give some generalized Euler-like recursive formulas for the $\mathrm{spt}$ function in terms of Hecke trace of values of special twisted quadratic Dirichlet series. As a corollary, we give a closed form expressions of the power series $\sum_{n\geq 0}\mathrm{spt}(\ell n-δ_{\ell})q^n\pmod{\ell}$, $δ_{\ell}:=(\ell^2-1)/24$, by Hecke traces for weight $\ell+1 $ cusp forms on $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We further establish an incongruence result for the $\mathrm{spt}$ function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An effective upper bound is established for the least non-trivial integer solution to the system of cubic forms $$ \begin{cases} F = c_{1}x_1^3 + c_{2}x_2^3 + \cdots + c_{n}x_n^3 = 0, \\ G = d_{1}x_1^3 + d_{2}x_2^3 + \cdots + d_{n}x_n^3 = 0, \end{cases} $$ under the "$M$-good" condition for $n \ge 16$, where $c_{1}, \dots, c_{n}$ and $d_{1}, \dots, d_{n}$ are integers. Additionally, a range is derived for the probability that randomly selected simultaneous equations satisfy the $M$-good condition.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Mohammad H. M Rashid &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper establishes several fundamental structural properties of the $q$-Heisenberg algebra $\mathfrak{h}_n(q)$, a quantum deformation of the classical Heisenberg algebra. We first prove that when $q$ is not a root of unity, the global homological dimension of $\mathfrak{h}_n(q)$ is exactly $3n$, while it becomes infinite when $q$ is a root of unity. We then demonstrate the rigidity of its iterated Ore extension structure, showing that any such presentation is essentially unique up to permutation and scaling of variables. The graded automorphism group is completely determined to be isomorphic to $(\mathbb{C}^*)^{2n} \rtimes S_n$. Furthermore, $\mathfrak{h}_n(q)$ is shown to possess a universal deformation property as the canonical PBW-preserving deformation of the classical Heisenberg algebra $\mathfrak{h}_n(1)$. We compute its Hilbert series as $(1-t)^{-3n}$, confirming polynomial growth of degree $3n$, and establish that its Gelfand--Kirillov dimension coincides with its classical Krull dimension. These results are extended to a generalized multi-parameter version $\mathfrak{H}_n(\mathbf{Q})$, and illustrated through detailed examples and applications in representation theory and deformation quantization.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Updated, following referee's suggestions and comments

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the late eighties, Hildebrand and Tenenbaum proved an asymptotic formula for the number of positive integers below $x$, having exactly $ν$ distinct prime divisors: $π_ν(x) \sim x δ_ν(x)$. Here we consider the restricted count $π_ν(x,y)$ for integers lying in the short interval $(x,x+y]$. In this setting, we show that for any $\varepsilon >0$, the asymptotic equivalence $$ π_ν(x,y) \sim y δ_ν(x)$$ holds uniformly over all $1 \le ν\le (\log x)^{1/3}/(\log \log x)^2$ and all $x^{17/30 + \varepsilon} \leq y \leq x$. The methods also furnish mean upper bounds for the $k$-fold divisor function $τ_k$ in short intervals, with strong uniformity in $k$.</p></details>

In the semisimple case, we compute the Schur elements for both $\mathcal{H}^f_{c}(n)$ and the cyclotomic Sergeev algebra $\mathcal{h}^g_{c}(n)$. As applications, we define new symmetrizing forms on the Hecke-Clifford algebra $\mathcal{H}(n)$ and on the cyclotomic quiver Hecke algebras of types $A^{(1)}_{e-1}$ and $C^{(1)}_e$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** We have extended all the main results in the previous version to hyper-kloosterman sums, and the title of the paper adjusted accordingly

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\kl_n(a,b;m)$ be the hyper-Kloosterman sum. Fix integers $n\geqslant2,a\neq0$, $b\neq0$ and $k\geqslant2$. For any $0\neqη\in\mathbb{C}$ and multiplicative function $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, we prove that $\kl_n(a,b;m)\neqηf(m)$ holds for $100\%$ square-free $k$-almost prime numbers $m$ and $100\%$ square-free numbers $m$. Counterintuitively, if $\kl_n(a,b;p)=ηf(p)$ holds for all but finitely many primes $p$, we further show that \begin{align*} \ab|\{m\leqslant X:\kl_n(a,b;m)=ηf(m), m \text{ square-free }k\text{-almost prime}\}|= O(X^{1-\frac{1}{k+1}}). \end{align*} These results overturn the general belief that $\kl_n(a,b;m)$ is nearly multiplicative in $m$, and that its distribution at almost prime moduli $m$ closely approximates that at primes. Moreover, we prove that these results also hold for general algebraic exponential sums satisfying some natural conditions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the BPS decomposition theorem (a.k.a. cohomological integrality theorem) decomposing the cohomology of smooth symmetric stacks into the Weyl-invariant part of the cohomological Hall induction of the intersection cohomology of good moduli spaces. As a consequence, we establish the BPS decomposition theorem for the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks and for the critical cohomology of symmetric $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks, thereby generalizing the main result of Bu--Davison--Ibáñez Nuñez--Kinjo--Pădurariu to the non-orthogonal setting. We will present three applications of our main result. First, we confirm Halpern-Leistner's conjecture on the purity of the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks admitting proper good moduli spaces, extending Davison's work on the moduli stack of objects in $2$-Calabi--Yau categories. Second, we prove versions of Kirwan surjectivity for the critical cohomology of symmetric $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks and for the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks. Finally, by applying our main result to the character stacks associated with compact oriented $3$-manifolds, we reduce the quantum geometric Langlands duality conjecture for $3$-manifolds, as formulated by Safronov, from an isomorphism between infinite-dimensional critical cohomologies to a comparison of finite-dimensional BPS cohomologies.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we show that for a broad class of pseudoconvex formal-analytic arithmetic surfaces over $\text{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$, those which admit a nonconstant monic such regular function, that a conjecture of Bost-Charles that the ring of regular functions has continuum cardinality is implied by a purely complex-analytic conjecture. Under the conjecture, a Fekete-Szego-type approximation argument produces a polynomial "large" relative to the regular function, which in turn yields continuum many distinct regular functions. We also introduce a formula for the pushforward by a holomorphic function of the equilibrium Green's functions for our bordered Riemann surface with boundary, a formula which has constant term related to Arakelov degree.</p></details>

The direct product $\sym_n^{\times t}$ of the symmetric group $\sym_n$ acts on the homology of rank-selected subposets of $B_n^{(t)}$. We give an explicit formula for the decomposition into $\sym_n^{\times t}$-irreducibles of the homology of the full poset, as well as formulas for the diagonal action of the symmetric group $\sym_n$. For the rank-selected homology, we show that the stable principal specialisation of the product Frobenius characteristic of the $\sym_n^{\times t}$-module coincides with the corresponding rank-selected invariant of the $t$-fold Segre power of the subspace lattice.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the average number of lattice points within a ball for the $n$th cyclotomic number field, where the lattice is chosen at random from the set of unit determinant ideal lattices of the field. We show that this average is nearly identical to the average number of lattice points in a ball among all unit determinant random lattices of the same dimension. To establish this result, we apply the Hecke integration formula and subconvexity bounds on Dedekind zeta functions of cyclotomic fields. The symmetries arising from the roots of unity in an ideal lattice allow us to prove the existence of ideal lattice packings of dimension $\varphi(n)$ and density $n\cdot 2^{-\varphi(n)}(1+o(1))$ as $n$ goes to infinity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The purpose of this paper is to study motivic aspects of the Hitchin system for $\mathrm{GL}_n$. Our results include the following. (a) We prove the motivic decomposition conjecture of Corti-Hanamura for the Hitchin system; in particular, the decomposition theorem associated with the Hitchin system is induced by algebraic cycles. This yields an unconditional construction of the motivic perverse filtration for the Hitchin system, which lifts the cohomological/sheaf-theoretic perverse filtration. (b) We prove that the inverse of the relative Hard Lefschetz symmetry is induced by a relative algebraic correspondence, confirming the relative Lefschetz standard conjecture for the Hitchin system. (c) We show a strong perversity bound for the normalized Chern classes of a universal bundle with respect to the motivic perverse filtration; this specializes to the sheaf-theoretic result obtained earlier by Maulik-Shen. (d) We prove a $χ$-independence result for the relative Chow motives associated with Hitchin systems. Our methods combine Fourier transforms for compactified Jacobian fibrations associated with integral locally planar curves, nearby and vanishing cycle techniques, and a Springer-theoretic interpretation of parabolic Hitchin moduli spaces.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 24 pages. Comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, assuming the weak Schanuel Conjecture (WSC), we prove that for any collection of pairwise non-arithmetically equivalent totally real number fields, the residues at $s=1$ of their Dedekind zeta functions form a linearly independent set over the field of algebraic numbers. As a corollary, we obtain that, under WSC, two totally real number fields have the same regulator if and only if they have the same class number and Dedekind zeta function. We also prove that, under WSC, the isometry and similarity classes of the log unit lattice of a real Galois number field of degree $[K:\Q]\geq 4$, characterize the isomorphism class of said field. All of our results follow from establishing that, under WSC, any Gram matrix of the log unit lattice of a real Galois number field yields a generic point of certain closed irreducible $\Q$-subvariety of the space of symmetric matrices of appropriate size.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 41 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a sharp, quantitative analogue of Helgason's conjecture at the level of distributions: For a semisimple Lie group $G$ of real rank one, Poisson transforms map a Sobolev space on $P\backslash G$ boundedly with closed range to an $L^2$-space on $K\backslash G$. The result is obtained for the Poisson transform studied by Knapp-Wallach under the name Szegö map, and the appropriate Sobolev spaces are defined using van Erp-Yuncken's Heisenberg calculus. The proof generalizes to show that commutators of this Poisson transform with smooth functions on the Furstenberg compactification are compact. This proves the remaining open conjecture in Julg's seminal program to establish the Baum-Connes conjecture for closed subgroups of semisimple Lie groups of real rank one.</p></details>

We resolve a recent question of Zantema and Bosma about linear subsequences of $k$-automatic sequences with input in most-significant-digit-first format.

> **Comment:** 38 pages + appendices. v2: minor edits

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We discuss the holographic correspondence between 3d "Chern-Simons gravity" and an ensemble of 2d Narain code CFTs. Starting from 3d abelian Chern-Simons theory, we construct an ensemble of boundary CFTs defined by gauging all possible maximal subgroups of the bulk one-form symmetry. Each maximal non-anomalous subgroup is isomorphic to a classical even self-dual error-correcting code over $\mathbb Z_p\times \mathbb Z_p$, providing a way to define a boundary "code CFT." The average over the ensemble of such theories is holographically dual to Chern-Simons gravity, a bulk theory summed over 3d topologies sharing the same boundary. In the case of prime $p$, the sum reduces to that over handlebodies, i.e. becomes the Poincaré series akin to that in semiclassical gravity. As the main result of the paper, we show that the mathematical identity underlying this holographic duality can be understood and rigorously proven using the framework of Howe duality over finite fields. This framework is concerned with the representation theory of two commuting groups forming a dual pair: the symplectic group of modular transformations of the boundary, and an orthogonal group mapping codes to each other. Finally, we reformulate the holographic duality as an identity between different averages over quantum stabilizer states, providing an interpretation in terms of quantum information theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a continuous version of preprojective algebras of type $A$. In particular, we are interested in the preprojective category over an open, bounded subinterval $\mathbb{I}$ of $\mathbb{R}$, denoted $Λ_{\mathbb{I}}$. We study the representable projective modules and define a useful type of sub- and quotient module called decorous modules. These are completely described by a function from the closure $\overline{\mathbb{I}}$ of $\mathbb{I}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ whose 'slopes' are not too steep anywhere. We later use these to describe permuton ideals, a generalization of the support $τ$-tilting ideals of preprojective algebras of type $A_n$, which we call permutation ideals. Once we have our generalization, we show that permutation ideals can be recovered from permuton ideals. Moreover, permutation ideals are $τ$-rigid and we show an analogous property for our permuton ideals. Along the way, we classify all the brick $Λ_{\mathbb{I}}$-modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Division polynomials associated to an elliptic curve $E/K$ are polynomials $φ_n, ψ_n^2$ that arise from the sequence of points $\{nP\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ on this curve. If one wishes to study $\mathbb{Z}$--linear combination of points on $E(K)$, we can use net polynomials $Φ_{v}, Ψ_{v}^2$ which are higher--dimensional analogue of division polynomials. It turns out they are also elliptic nets, an $n$--dimensional array with values in $K$ satisfying the same nonlinear recurrence relation that division polynomials do as well. Now further assume the elliptic curve $E/K$ has complex multiplication by an order of a quadratic imaginary field $F \subseteq K$, we will prove a formula for the common valuation of $Φ_{v}$ and $Ψ_{v}^2$ associated to multiples of points by elements of an order in $F$. As an application, we will use the formula to show that elliptic divisibility sequences associated to multiples of points indexed by elements of an order also satisfy a recurrence relation when indexed by elements of an order, subject to certain conditions on the indices. Additionally, we also expect that the formula may also be used in computing $\mathcal{O}_K$--integral points of an elliptic curve of rank $2$ with complex multiplication (this is future work).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Geiss, Leclerc and Schröer introduced a class of 1-Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras $H$ associated to symmetrizable Cartan matrices with acyclic orientations, generalizing the path algebras of acyclic quivers. They also proved that indecomposable rigid $H$-modules of finite projective dimension are in bijection with non-initial cluster variables of the corresponding Fomin-Zelevinsky cluster algebra. In this article, we prove in all affine types that their conjectural Caldero-Chapoton type formula on these modules coincide with the Laurent expression of cluster variables. By taking generic Caldero-Chapoton functions on varieties of modules of finite projective dimension, we obtain bases for affine type cluster algebras with full-rank coefficients containing all cluster monomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the present paper, we study the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local fields from the point of view of anabelian geometry. In particular, we show that, under certain mild assumptions, the image of the natural homomorphism from the automorphism group of a mixed-characteristic local field to the outer automorphism group of the associated absolute Galois group is not a normal subgroup. Furthermore, we show that, for the absolute Galois group of a mixed-characteristic local field satisfying certain assumptions, there exist a continuous representation and a continuous automorphism of the group such that the former is irreducible, abelian, and crystalline, but the continuous representation obtained as the composite of the former with the latter is not even Hodge-Tate. These results significantly generalize previous works by Hoshi and Nishio. A key observation in obtaining these results is to focus on the analogy between the mapping class groups of topological surfaces and the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local fields. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first work applying results from the theory of mapping class groups to the anabelian geometry of mixed-characteristic local fields, going beyond a mere analogy between the two.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the holomorphic solutions of Picard-Fuchs differential equations associated with one-parameter families of abelian varieties with real multiplication admit power series expansions with $S$-integral coefficients at a maximal unipotent monodromy point. This extends classical integrality results for hypergeometric functions and Bouw-Möller's work on Teichmüller curves. The integral solutions are related to the non-ordinary locus of the modulo $p$ reduction of the family, whose cardinality we bound in terms of the Euler characteristic and Lyapunov exponents of the base curve. In some cases, the non-ordinary locus can be recovered by truncating the integral solutions, as in Igusa's classical observation for the Legendre family. We also establish $S$-integrality of expansions of modular forms at cusps in terms of a modular function for (not necessarily arithmetic) Fuchsian groups with modular embeddings, and deduce congruences. These results are applied in subsequent work to construct lifts of partial Hasse invariants for rational curves in Hilbert modular varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be an odd prime integer, $F/\mathbb{Q}$ be an imaginary quadratic field, and $Ψ$ be a small slope cuspidal Bianchi modular form over $F$ which is non-ordinary at $p$. In this article, we first construct a $p$-adic distribution $L^{\mathrm{As}}_{p}(Ψ)$ that interpolates the twisted critical $L$-values of Asai (or twisted tensor) $L$-function of $Ψ$, generalizing the works of Loeffler--Williams from the ordinary case to the non-ordinary case. To obtain this distribution, we construct some polynomials using Asai--Eisenstein elements: the Betti analogue of the Euler system machinery, developed by Loeffler--Williams. We use some techniques analogous to those of Loeffler--Zerbes for interpolating the twists of Beilinson--Flach elements arising in the Euler system associated with Rankin--Selberg convolutions of elliptic modular forms. We also use the interpolation method developed by Amice--Vélu, Perrin-Riou, and Büyükboduk--Lei in the construction. Furthermore, under some assumptions, we decompose these unbounded $p$-adic distributions into the linear combination of bounded measures as done by Pollack, Sprung, and Lei--Loeffler--Zerbes in the elliptic modular forms case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p\geq 3$ be a prime number and $K$ be a quadratic imaginary field in which $p$ splits as $\mathfrak{p}\overline{\mathfrak{p}}$. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a cuspidal Bianchi eigenform over $K$ of weight $(k,k)$, where $k\geq 0$ is an integer, level $\mathfrak{m}$ coprime to $p$, and non-ordinary at both of the primes above $p$. We assume $\mathcal{F}$ has trivial nebentypus. For $\mathfrak{q}\in\{\mathfrak{p}, \overline{\mathfrak{p}}\}$, let $a_{\mathfrak{q}}$ be the $T_{\mathfrak{q}}$ Hecke eigenvalue of $\mathcal{F}$ and let $α_{\mathfrak{q}},β_{\mathfrak{q}}$ be the roots of polynomial $X^{2} -a_{\mathfrak{q}}X+ p^{k+1}$. Then we have four $p$-stabilizations of $\mathcal{F}$: $\mathcal{F}^{α_{\mathfrak{p}},α_{\overline{\mathfrak{p}}}}, \mathcal{F}^{α_{\mathfrak{p}},β_{\overline{\mathfrak{p}}}}, \mathcal{F}^{β_{\mathfrak{p}},α_{\overline{\mathfrak{p}}}},$ and $ \mathcal{F}^{β_{\mathfrak{p}},β_{\overline{\mathfrak{p}}}}$ which are Bianchi cuspforms of level $p\mathfrak{m}$. By the works of Williams, to each $p$-stabilization $\mathcal{F}^{*,\dagger}$, we can attach a locally analytic distribution $L_{p}(\mathcal{F}^{*,\dagger})$ over the ray class group $\text{Cl}(K,p^{\infty})$. On viewing $L_{p}(\mathcal{F}^{*,\dagger})$ as a two-variable power series with coefficients in some $p$-adic field having unbounded denominators satisfying certain growth conditions, we decompose this power series into a linear combination of power series with bounded coefficients in the spirit of Pollack, Sprung, and Lei--Loeffler--Zerbes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a filtration by ideals on quantum cohomology for symplectic manifolds with a Hamiltonian $S^1$-action that extends to a pseudoholomorphic $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. These spaces include all Conical Symplectic Resolutions, in particular all Quiver Varieties. In particular, we obtain a family of filtrations on singular cohomology for any Conical Symplectic Resolution, that is sensitive to the choice of $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. The symplectic form is rarely exact at infinity for these spaces, so substantial foundational work is carried out to rigorously define Floer theory, in particular symplectic cohomology. Using Floer theory, we construct a periodic persistence module, giving rise to a graded periodic barcode associated to the $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This encodes birth-death phenomena of Floer invariants. Our filtrations can be viewed as a Floer-theoretic analogue of Atiyah-Bott filtrations, arising from stratifying a manifold by gradient flowlines of a Morse-Bott function, but they are distinct from those and they can detect non-topological properties of the quantum product.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper introduces and systematically studies a new class of non-commutative algebras -- Weyl-type and Witt-type algebras -- generated by differential operators with exponential and generalized power function coefficients. We define the expolynomial ring $R_{p,t,\mathcal{A}} = \mathbb{F}\bigl[ e^{\pm x^{p} e^{t}},\; e^{\mathcal{A} x},\; x^{\mathcal{A}} \bigr]$ associated to an additive subgroup $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathbb{F}$, and investigate its Ore extension $A_{p,t,\mathcal{A}} = R_{p,t,\mathcal{A}}[\partial; δ]$ (Weyl-type) and its derivation algebra $\mathfrak{g}_{p,t,\mathcal{A}} = \mathrm{Der}_{\mathbb{F}}(R_{p,t,\mathcal{A}})$ (Witt-type). Our main results establish: (1) the automorphism group of $R_{p,t,\mathcal{A}}$ is isomorphic to $(\mathbb{F}^{\times})^{2r+1} \rtimes \mathrm{GL}(2r+1,\mathbb{Z})$; (2) a Galois descent theorem showing that fixed-point subalgebras under finite Galois actions recover the original Weyl-type algebra; (3) the non-existence of finite-dimensional simple modules for $A_{p,t,\mathcal{A}}$; (4) the Zariski density of isomorphism classes in moduli spaces as transcendental parameters vary; (5) the stability of simplicity under generic quantum deformation; and (6) a complete representation-theoretic framework including the classification of irreducible weight modules, the construction of Harish--Chandra modules with BGG-type resolutions, and the structure of category $\mathcal{O}$. These results unify and extend classical theories of Weyl algebras, Witt algebras, and generalized Weyl algebras, while opening new directions in deformation theory, non-commutative geometry, and the representation theory of infinite-dimensional algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cluster algebras, introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky through the process of quiver mutation, have become central objects in modern algebra and geometry, linking combinatorial constructions with diverse mathematical domains such as Teichmuller theory, total positivity, and even theoretical physics. Building on foundational work by Fomin, Shapiro, and Thurston connecting cluster algebras to triangulated surfaces, recent research has extended mutation theory to infinite settings, including the infinity-gon and more general marked surfaces. In this paper, we develop a purely combinatorial framework for mutation of infinite quivers, independent of but compatible with these topological constructions. By formalizing infinite quivers as limits of embedded finite quivers, we establish a consistent definition of mutation that generalizes prior surface-based results. We then apply this framework to extend the notion of reddening sequences, special mutation sequences with significant algebraic consequences, from the finite to the infinite setting. Our approach not only unifies previous topological and combinatorial perspectives but also provides a technical foundation for further generalizations of cluster algebra theory in the infinite case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The deformation approach of arXiv:2104.07816 for computing zeta functions of one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds is generalised to cover also multiparameter manifolds. Consideration of the multiparameter case requires the development of an improved formalism. This allows us, among other things, to make progress on some issues left open in previous work, such as the treatment of apparent and conifold singularities and changes of coordinates. We also discuss the efficient numerical computation of the zeta functions. As examples, we compute the zeta functions of the two-parameter mirror octic, a non-symmetric split of the quintic threefold also with two parameters, and the $S_5$ symmetric five-parameter Hulek-Verrill manifolds. These examples allow us to exhibit the several new types of geometries for which our methods make practical computations possible. They also act as consistency checks, as our results reproduce and extend those of arXiv:hep-th/0409202 and arXiv:math/0304169. To make the methods developed here more approachable, a Mathematica package "CY3Zeta" for computing the zeta functions of Calabi-Yau threefolds, which is attached to this paper, is presented.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Raimi's classical theorem establishes a partition of the natural numbers with a remarkable unavoidability property: for every finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, there is a color class whose translate meets both parts of the partition in infinitely many points. Recently, Kang, Koh, and Tran have extended this phenomenon to the circle group, proving that there exists a measurable partition of the circle such that every finite measurable cover admits a rotation whose image meets each part of the partition in positive measure. This paper shows that this phenomenon extends beyond compact abelian groups to a wide class of non-group geometric surfaces that still exhibit \textit{a hidden one-dimensional symmetry}. Specifically, we establish analogs of Raimi's theorem for three families of surfaces (with their natural surface measures): the unit sphere $S^{n-1} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, rotational power surfaces (such as cones and paraboloids), and circular cylindrical surfaces. The common feature is that each of these surfaces carries a natural measure-preserving action of the circle group by rotation in a fixed plane and admits a measurable trivialization as a product $C \times Y$. This circle-bundle structure allows the measurable Raimi partition on the base circle to be lifted to an unavoidable partition on the manifold. Our approach is unified through a general circle-bundle theorem, which reduces all three geometric cases to verifying suitable equivariance and product disintegration properties of the surface measure.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve. We say that $E$ has a near coincidence of level $(n,m)$ if $m \mid n$ and $\mathbb{Q}(E[n]) = \mathbb{Q}(E[m],ζ_{n})$. We classify near coincidences of prime power level and use this result to give a classification of values of $n$ for which ${\rm Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(E[n])/\mathbb{Q})$ is a nilpotent group. Along the way we prove a Gauss-Wantzel analog for the elliptic curve $E\colon y^2 = x^3-x$, showing that $\mathbb{Q}(E[n])/\mathbb{Q}$ is constructible if and only if $\varphi(n)$ is a power of 2. Assuming that there are no non-CM rational points on the modular curves $X_{ns}^{+}(p)$ for primes $p > 11$, we show that ${\rm Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(E[n])/\mathbb{Q})$ nilpotent implies that $n$ is a power of $2$ or $n \in \{ 3, 5, 6, 7, 15, 21 \}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a strengthening of the proof of the Stéphanois theorem. We follow the modular version by Waldschmidt, which is based in a suggestion by Daniel Bertrand, but it also applies to the original proof. The improvement is not in the result or the conditions, but in the need of weaker tools on the proof itself. More precisely, we only employ modular polynomials of prime degree, instead of polynomials of arbitrary level. Furthermore, one can restrict to primes in fixed arithmetic sequence. On the proof itself, the only crucial difference appears in Cinquième pas and on the final contradiction in Septième pas of Waldschmidt's proof, but for readability, we present a complete proof with this modification. This is part of a larger project to generalize the Stéphanois theorem to the Igusa invariants of curves of genus two, as the Siegel modular polynomials in the literature are usually only considered for prime levels. The material is part of Chapter 7 of the author's PhD thesis.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Major revision: 29 pages. New unconditional spectral proof of PFR/Marton in and ; finite-field case reorganized as a corollary and exposition expanded

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We settle the Polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa (PFR/Marton) conjecture for the integers and for cyclic groups. More precisely, we show that if $A$ is a finite subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ with $|A+A| \le K|A|$, then there is a subgroup $H$ of index at most $K^{O(1)}$ such that $A$ is contained in at most $K^{O(1)}$ cosets of $H$. The proof is based on a new spectral stability dichotomy for the $L^4$ Fourier mass of $\mathbf{1}_A$: either this mass is concentrated on a span of size $K^{O(1)}$, or, after passing to a quotient of codimension $K^{O(1)}$, the doubling constant of the image of $A$ decreases by a definite power of $K$. Using Freiman modeling we transfer this dichotomy to cyclic groups, obtain polynomial Bogolyubov-type bounds, and deduce Marton's conjecture in $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$. As a corollary, we also recover and extend the finite-field formulation of Marton's conjecture: in odd characteristic we obtain a direct spectral proof, and together with the characteristic-2 result of Green, Gowers, Manners, and Tao this yields a complete resolution of the conjecture for all finite fields. For context beyond finite fields, we recall their theorem for abelian groups of bounded exponent.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Conjectures of Braverman and Kazhdan, Ngô and Sakellaridis have motivated the development of Schwartz spaces for certain spherical varieties. We prove that under suitable assumptions these Schwartz spaces are naturally a representation of a group that we christen the modulation group. This provides a broad generalization of the defining representation of the metaplectic group. The example of a vector space and the zero locus of a quadric cone in an even number of variables are discussed in detail. In both of these cases the modulation group is closely related to algebraic groups, and we propose a conjectural method of linking modulation groups to ind-algebraic groups in general. At the end of the paper we discuss adelization and the relationship between representations of modulation groups and the Poisson summation conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the $L_p$-discrepancy of random point sets in high dimensions, with emphasis on small values of $p$. Although the classical $L_p$-discrepancy suffers from the curse of dimensionality for all $p \in (1,\infty)$, the gap between known upper and lower bounds remains substantial, in particular for small $p \ge 1$. To clarify this picture, we review the existing results for i.i.d.\ uniformly distributed points and derive new upper bounds for \emph{generalized} $L_p$-discrepancies, obtained by allowing non-uniform sampling densities and corresponding non-negative quadrature weights. Using the probabilistic method, we show that random points drawn from optimally chosen product densities lead to significantly improved upper bounds. For $p=2$ these bounds are explicit and optimal; for general $p \in [1,\infty)$ we obtain sharp asymptotic estimates. The improvement can be interpreted as a form of importance sampling for the underlying Sobolev space $F_{d,q}$. Our results also reveal that, even with optimal densities, the curse of dimensionality persists for random points when $p\ge 1$, and it becomes most pronounced for small $p$. This suggests that the curse should also hold for the classical $L_1$-discrepancy for deterministic point sets.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 101 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We undertake the study of complex rank analogues of parabolic category O defined using Deligne categories. We regard these categories as a family over an affine space, introduce a stratification on this parameter space, and formulate conjectures on the structural constancy of fibers on each stratum. Using the theory of $\mathfrak{sl}_{\mathbb{Z}}$-categorification, we prove these conjectures for admissible strata. Namely, we axiomatize the notion of multi-Fock tensor product categorifications (MFTPCs), which are interval finite highest weight categories equipped with a compatible action of commuting copies of $\mathfrak{sl}_{\mathbb{Z}}$, categorifying an external tensor product of tensor products of highest and lowest weight Fock space representations. We prove a uniqueness theorem for admissible MFTPCs and show that complex rank parabolic categories O have the structure of MFTPCs. In turn, for suitable choices of parameters, we produce an equivalence of complex rank category O with a stable limit of classical parabolic categories O, resolving our conjecture in the admissible case. These equivalences yield multiplicities of simple objects in Verma modules in terms of stable parabolic Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials, answering a question posed by Etingof. In particular, for the case of two Levi blocks of non-integral size, we completely describe the structure of the corresponding category O in terms of stable representation theory. As an application, we obtain multiplicities for parabolic analogs of hyperalgebra Verma modules introduced by Haboush in the large rank and large characteristic limit.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $ E $ be an elliptic curve defined over a number field, the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD, for short) asserts a deep relation between the group $ E(K) $ of rational points and the $ L-$function $ L(E/K, s)$ of $ E $ at $ s = 1. $ Very few explicit results about $ E(K) $ and $ L(1) $ are known, even no general method is known to determine $ L(1) $ vanishing or not for a given elliptic curve. In this paper, we study some quantities related to BSD of a special class of elliptic curves, more precisely, we study the arithmetic of quadratic twists of elliptic curves $ y^{2} = x(x + \varepsilon p )(x + \varepsilon q) $ and their $L-$function. Based on some classical works, especially those of Greenberg, Kramer-Tunnell, Kato-Rohrlich, Manin and Mazur, under some conditions, we obtain results about the vanishing of the value at $ s = 1 $ of the $ L$-function, and explicitly determine the following quantities: the norm index $ δ(E, \Q, K), $ the root numbers, the set of anomalous prime numbers, a few prime numbers at which the image of Galois representation are surjective. We also study the relation between the ranks of the Mordell-Weil groups, Selmer groups and Shafarevich-Tate groups, and the structure about the $ l^{\infty }-$Selmer groups and the Mordell-Weil groups over $ \Z_{l}-$extension via Iwasawa theory. These results provide some useful evidence toward verifying the BSD for a family of elliptic curves.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a robust structure theory for multiple ergodic averages of commuting transformations along Hardy sequences of polynomial growth. We then apply it to derive a number of novel results on joint ergodicity, recurrence and convergence. In particular, we prove joint ergodicity for (a) pairwise independent Hardy sequences and weakly mixing transformations, (b) strongly independent Hardy sequences and ergodic transformations, (c) strongly irrationally independent Hardy sequences and totally ergodic transformations. We use these joint ergodicity results to provide new recurrence results for multidimensional patterns along strongly independent Hardy sequences, showing for instance that all subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ of positive upper density contain patterns of the form $$ (m_1, m_2),\; (m_1 + \lfloor n^{\sqrt{2}}\rfloor, m_2),\; (m_1, m_2 + \lfloor n^{\sqrt{2}} + n^{1/2}\rfloor).$$ Last but not least, we positively resolve the joint ergodicity classification problem for pairwise independent Hardy sequences, of which the aforementioned families are special cases. While building on recent technical advances (e.g. PET coefficient tracking schemes and joint ergodicity criteria), our work introduces a number of technical developments of its own. We construct a suitable generalization of Host-Kra and box seminorms that quantitatively control ergodic averages along Hardy sequences. We subsequently use them to obtain Host-Kra seminorm estimates for averages along all pairwise independent Hardy sequences. Furthermore, we develop an ergodic version of the quantitative concatenation argument that has recently found extensive use in combinatorics, number theory and harmonic analysis. Lastly, we obtain new simultaneous Taylor approximations for Hardy sequences, a crucial ingredient to deal with the aforementioned classes of Hardy sequences.</p></details>
