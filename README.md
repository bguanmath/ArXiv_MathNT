 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zuo Lin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DS &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an effective equidistribution theorem for orbits of certain unipotent subgroups in arithmetic quotients of semisimple Lie groups with a polynomial error term. This provides the first infinite family of examples where effective equidistribution, with polynomial error rate, of non-horospherical unipotent subgroups in semisimple quotients is obtained. As applications, we obtain effective estimate on distribution of lattice orbits on homogeneous spaces, as well as an effective version of the Oppenheim conjecture for indefinite quadratic forms with a polynomial error rate in all dimension $d \geq 3$. We also prove a sub-modularity inequality for irreducible representation of connected algebraic group, which is crucial to our proof and is of independent interest.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sebastian Debus, Tobias Metzlaff &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The action of a Weyl group on the associated weight lattice induces an additive action on the symmetric algebra and a multiplicative action on the group algebra of the lattice. We show that the coinvariant space of the multiplicative action affords the regular representation and is isomorphic to a space of multiplicative harmonics, which corresponds to existing results for additive coinvariants of reflection groups. We then design an algorithm to compute a multiplicative coinvariant basis from an additive one. The algorithm preserves isotypic decomposition and graded structure and enables the study of multiplicative coinvariants by integrating combinatorial knowledge from the additive setting. We investigate the Weyl groups of type A and C to find new explicit equivariant maps and combinatorial structure.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The dga of planar loops was introduced in recent work of the author, Boyd, Randal-Williams, and Sroka, where a minimal model for it was given. This dga enjoys two natural `reflection' involutions. In the first nontrivial case, $2n=4$, we give a new model which incorporates these involutions, as well as a more explicit description of the existing model.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a family of PBWD bases for the positive subalgebras of quantum loop algebras of type $C_n$ and $D_n$, as well as their Lusztig and RTT integral forms, in the new Drinfeld realization. We also establish a shuffle algebra realization of these $\mathbb{Q}(v)$-algebras (proved earlier in arXiv:2102.11269 by completely different tools) and generalize the latter to the above $\mathbb{Z}[v,v^{-1}]$-forms. The rational counterparts provide shuffle algebra realizations of positive subalgebras of type $C_n$ and $D_n$ Yangians and their Drinfeld-Gavarini duals. While this naturally generalizes our earlier treatment of the classical type $B_n$ in arXiv:2305.00810 and $A_n$ in arXiv:1808.09536, the specialization maps in the present setup are more compelling.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $C$ be a smooth projective absolutely irreducible curve of genus at least 2, defined over the rationals. For a number field $L$, let $C(L)_{new} = \{P \in C(L) : \mathbb{Q}(P)=L\}$. Let $n$ be at least 2. We conjecture that $C(L)_{new}$ is empty for 100 percent of degree $n$ number fields $L$ when ordered by absolute discriminant. We prove our conjecture for $n=3$ with $C$ any of the modular curves $X_0(23)$, $X_0(29)$, $X_0(31)$ and $X_0(64)$. Moreover, we prove the analogue of this conjecture for the unit equation, again with $n=3$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15595v1'>2511.15595</a>\]&nbsp; **A sharp threshold for arithmetic effects on the tail probabilities of lacunary sums**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Christoph Aistleitner, Lorenz Fruehwirth, Joscha Prochno &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 23 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A classical observation in analysis asserts that lacunary systems of dilated functions show many properties which are also typical for systems of independent random variables. For example, if $(n_k)_{k \ge 1}$ is a sequence of integers satisfying the Hadamard gap condition $n_{k+1}/n_k\ge q > 1,~k \ge 1$, then the normalized sums $\sum_{n=1}^N \cos(2πn_k x)$, considered on the probability space $[0,1]$ with Borel $σ$-field and Lebesgue measure, satisfy the central limit theorem (CLT) and the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL). Remarkably, the situation becomes much more deliacate when the trigonometric function $\cos(2 πx)$ is replaced by a more general 1-periodic function $f$, and fine arithmetic properties of the sequence $(n_k)_{k \ge 1}$ come into play. The most relevant arithmetic property can be phrased in terms of the number of solutions of certain 2-variable Diophantine equations. Recently, the authors proved that the validity of the LIL requires a strictly stronger Diophantine criterion than the CLT. In the present paper we show that this is only a special case of a wide-ranging general principle: there is a sharp cutoff, which can be expressed in form of a Diophantine criterion on the sequence $(n_k)_{k \ge 1}$, at which the tail probabilities of $\sum_{k=1}^N f(n_k x)$ change from Gaussian to potentially erratic behavior. More precisely, let $L(N,a,b,c)$ be the number of solutions $(k,\ell)$ of the equation $a n_k - b n_\ell= c$, where $1\leq k,\ell \leq N$. Roughly speaking, we prove: if $L(N,a,b,c) \le N / g_N$ for some $g_N$, then $\mathbb{P} \left[\sum_{k=1}^N f(n_k x) > t \|f\|_2 \sqrt{N} \right]$ is asymptotically is accordance with standard normal behavior for all $t$ up to $\sqrt{2 \log g_N}$. We also show that this criterion is optimal in the sense that under the same premises, the conclusion can fail to be true for values of $t$ beyond this threshold.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** René Pfitscher &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 42 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish sharp algebraic criteria for the $L^{p}$-integrability, for $p = 1, 2, \infty$, of a natural generalization of the Siegel transform to the setting of rational representations of semisimple algebraic $\mathbb{Q}$-groups, extending Siegel's analytic work in the geometry of numbers. As an application, we derive an effective asymptotic formula for the number of rational approximations of bounded height to almost every real point on a rank-one flag variety at the Diophantine exponent. The argument combines the integrability criterion with effective equidistribution estimates for translated orbits of maximal compact subgroups, a result of independent interest.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04234v3'>2509.04234</a>\]&nbsp; **Simple harmonic oscillators from non-semisimple walled Brauer algebras**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sanjaye Ramgoolam, Michał Studziński &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** hep-th &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 78 pages, 15 figures; revisions-v2,v3 - minor typos corrected

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Walled Brauer algebras $B_N ( m , n ) $ illuminate the combinatorics of mixed tensor representations of $U(N)$, with $m$ copies of the fundamental and $n$ copies of the anti-fundamental representation. They lie at the intersection of research in representation theory, AdS/CFT and quantum information theory. They have been used to study of correlators in multi-matrix models motivated by brane-anti-brane physics in AdS/CFT. They have been applied in computing and optimising fidelities of port-based quantum teleportation. There is a large $N$ regime, specifically $ N \ge (m+n)$ where the algebras are semi-simple and their representation theory more tractable. There are known combinatorial formulae for dimensions of irreducible representations and associated reduction multiplicities. The large $N$ regime has a stability property whereby these formulae are independent of $N$. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the combinatorics in the non-semisimple regime of $ N = m +n - l $, with positive $l$. We introduce restricted Bratteli diagrams (RBD) which are useful as an instrument to process known data from the large $N$ regime to calculate representation theory data in the non-semisimple regime. We identify within the non-semisimple regime, a region of $(m,n)$-stability, where $ \min ( m, n ) \ge ( 2l -3) $ and the RBD take a stable form depending on $l$ only and not the choice of $ m,n$ within the region. In this regime, several aspects of the combinatorics of the RBD are controlled by a universal partition function for an infinite tower of simple harmonic oscillators closely related, but not identical, to the partition function of 2D non-chiral free scalar field theory.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Heng Huat Chan, Song Heng Chan, Zhi-Guo Liu, Wadim Zudilin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Around 1991, J.M. and P.B. Borwein established a cubic analogue of Jacobi's fundamental identity for theta functions. Their identity serves as the foundation for the subsequent development by B.C. Berndt, S. Bhargava, and F.G. Garvan of Ramanujan's theory of elliptic functions to the cubic base. In 2013, D. Schultz discovered an identity for theta series in three variables which generalizes the Borweins' identity. In this article, we revisit Schultz's identity and present two distinct approaches to its derivation. Our investigation not only provides new proofs but also yields several identities of a similar type. Furthermore, this study enables us to construct new two-variable generalizations of Jacobi's original classical identity.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 40 pages, final version, to appear in Forum of Mathematics, Pi

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that a very general hypersurface of degree d at least 4 and dimension at most $(d+1)2^{d-4}$ over a field of characteristic different from 2 does not admit a decomposition of the diagonal; hence, it is neither stably nor retract rational, nor $\mathbb{A}^1$-connected. Similar results hold in characteristic 2 under a slightly weaker degree bound. This improves earlier results by the second named author and Moe.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $W_{\mathrm{aff}}$ be an extended affine Weyl group and $\mathbf{H}$ and $J$ be the corresponding affine and asymptotic Hecke algebras with standard bases $\{T_x\}$ and $\{t_w\}$, respectively. Viewing $J$ as a subalgebra of the $\mathbf{q}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$-adic completion of $\mathbf{H}$, we give formulas for the coefficient of $T_x$ in $t_w$ for various $x$ and $w$ in the lowest two-sided cell, in terms of generalized exponents of the Langlands dual group, under a hypothesis on the left cell containing $w$. In particular our results hold for the canonical left cell. For such $w$ we also define a seemingly new positive basis for the corresponding subring of $J$. For $\mathrm{GL}_n$, we give partial results for some other cells.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 65 pages. final version, to appear in Journal of the AMS

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a theory of (etale) Berkovich motives. This is closely related to Ayoub's theory of rigid-analytic motives, but works uniformly in the archimedean and nonarchimedean setting. We aim for a self-contained treatment, not relying on previous work on algebraic or analytic motives. Applying the theory to discrete fields, one still recovers the etale version of Voevodsky's theory. Two notable features of our setting which do not hold in other settings are that over any base, the cancellation theorem holds true, and under only minor assumptions on the base, the stable $\infty$-category of motivic sheaves is rigid dualizable.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We fill the gaps in A. Gica's determination of all the odd positive integers $d$ for which the number of distinct prime divisors of $f_d(x)=d+x^2$ is less than or equal to $2$ for all the positive and odd integers $x\leq\sqrt{d}$. We also determine all the even positive integers $d$ for which the number of distinct prime divisors of $f_d(x)$ is less than or equal to $2$ for all the positive and even integers $x\leq\sqrt{d}$. These problems are related to the famous Frobenius-Rabinowitsch's characterization of the imaginary quadratic number fields ${\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{-d})$ of odd discriminants with class number one in terms of the primality of $f_d(x)/4$ for all the positive and odd integers $x\leq\sqrt{d}$. However, the solution to our problem is much more difficult to come up with. We also begin to address the same problems for the case of $f_d(x)=d-x^2$, in relation with the class groups of the real quadratic number fields ${\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{d})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a general construction of single-valued elliptic polylogarithms as functions on the once-punctured elliptic curve. Our formalism is an extension of Brown's construction of genus-zero single-valued polylogarithms to the elliptic curve: the condition of trivial monodromy for solutions to the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equation is expressed in terms of elliptic associators and involves two representations of a two-letter alphabet. Our elliptic single-valued condition reduces to Brown's genus-zero condition upon degeneration of the torus. We provide several examples for our construction, including the elliptic Bloch-Wigner dilogarithm.</p></details>

In this paper, we investigate two useful methods to obtain some irreducible representations that occur in this decomposition. Our main tolls are the semi-group property for Kronecker coefficients and generalized blocks of symmetric groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the function field setting with a fixed characteristic, it was proven by the second and third authors that the values $\log \big|L\big(\frac12, χ_D\big)\big|$ as $D$ varies over monic and square-free polynomials are asymptotically Gaussian distributed on the assumption of a low lying zeros hypothesis as the degree of $D$ tends to $\infty$. For real distinct shifts $t_j$ all of microscopic size or all of nonmicroscopic size relative to the genus, we consider linear combinations of $\log\big|L\big(\frac12+it_j, χ_D\big)\big|$ with real coefficients, and separately, of $\arg L\big(\frac12+it_j, χ_D\big).$ We provide estimates for their distribution functions under the low lying zeros hypothesis. We similarly study distribution functions of linear combinations of $\log\big|L\big(\frac12+it_j, E\otimes χ_D\big)\big|$, and separately $\arg L\big(\frac12+it_j, E\otimesχ_D\big)$, for quadratic twists of elliptic curves $E$ with root number one as the conductor gets large. As an application of these results, we prove a central limit theorem for the fluctuation of the number of nontrivial zeros of such $L$-functions from its mean, and thus recover previous results by Faifman and Rudnick. Correlations of such fluctuations are in harmony with the results of Bourgade, Coram and Diaconis, and Wieand for zeros of the Riemann zeta function and for eigenangles of unitary random matrices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Sawin recently gave an axiomatic characterization of multiple Dirichlet series over the function field $\mathbb{F}_{q}(T)$ and proved their existence by exhibiting the coefficients as trace functions of specific perverse sheaves. However, he did not prove that these series actually converge anywhere, instead treating them as formal power series. In this paper, we prove that these series do converge in a certain region, and moreover that the functions obtained by analytically continuing them satisfy functional equations. For convergence, it suffices to obtain bounds on the coefficients, for which we use the decomposition theorem for perverse sheaves, in combination with the Kontsevich moduli space of stable maps to construct a suitable compactification. For the functional equations, the key identity is a multi-variable generalization of the relationship between a Dirichlet character and its Fourier transform; in the multiple Dirichlet series setting, this uses a density trick for simple perverse sheaves and an explicit formula for intermediate extensions from the complement of a normal crossings divisor.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Choie and Kumar extensively studied the Herglotz-Zagier-Novikov function $\mathfrak{F}(z;u,v)$, defined as \begin{align*} \mathfrak{F}(z;u,v) = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\log(1-ut^z)}{v^{-1}-t} dt, \quad \textrm{for} \quad \mathfrak{Re}(z)>0. \end{align*} They obtained two-term, three-term and six-term functional equations for $\mathfrak{F}(z;u,v)$ and also evaluated special values in terms of di-logarithmic functions. Motivated from their work, we study the following two integrals, \begin{align*} \mathfrak{F}(z;u,v,w) &=\int_{0}^1 \frac{\log(1-ut^z)\log(1-wt^z)}{v^{-1}-t}\text{d}t, \\ \mathfrak{F}_k(z;u,v) &= \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\log^k(1-ut^z)}{v^{-1}-t} \, \text{d}t, \end{align*} for $\mathfrak{Re}(z)>0$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$. For $k=1$, the integral $\mathfrak{F}_k(z;u,v)$ reduces to $\mathfrak{F}(z;u,v)$. This allows us to recover the properties of $\mathfrak{F}(z;u,v)$ by studying the properties of $\mathfrak{F}_k(z;u,v)$. We evaluate special values of these two functions in terms of poly-logarithmic functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a generalization of the classical Nicomachus' identity for the sum of the first $n$ cubes. Unlike previous generalizations, it has three rather than two terms, and involves not just one, but two distinct triangular numbers, and each term is of degree $4$ in $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$. The asymptotic behavior for large $n$ leads to continued fractions with remarkable (but conjectural) properties. Moreover, we give a way of looking at squares of triangular numbers that involves the square root of $11$ and show it is a limiting case of a non-obvious identity involving truncations of the continued fraction expansion of that square root. The details involve a nonlinear recurrence that (with appropriate initial conditions) unexpectedly produces only integers, a ``Somos-type'' phenomenon.</p></details>

Furthermore, removing all restrictions on ${\bf r}$, we establish a metric dichotomy for Lebesgue almost every ${\bm α}.$ This solves a variant of a conjecture of González Robert, Hussain, Shulga and Ward [Conjecture 1.10, Bull.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Lüroth's theorem describes the dominant maps from rational curves over a field. In this note we study those dominant rational maps from cartesian powers $X^Ψ$ of geometrically irreducible varieties $X$ over a field $k$ for infinite sets $Ψ$ that are equivariant with respect to all permutations of the factors $X$. At least some of such maps arise as compositions $h:X^Ψ\xrightarrow{f^Ψ}Y^Ψ\to H\backslash Y^Ψ$, where $X\xrightarrow{f}Y$ is a dominant $k$-map and $H$ is a group of birational automorphisms of $Y|k$, acting diagonally on $Y^Ψ$. In characteristic 0, we show that this construction, when properly modified, gives all dominant equivariant maps from $X^Ψ$, if $\dim X=1$. For arbitrary $X$, the results are only partial. Also, a somewhat similar problem of describing the equivariant integral schemes over $X^Ψ$ of finite type is touched very briefly.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the group $\mathcal G$ which is the semidirect product of the group of analytic functions with values in ${\mathbb C}^*$ on the circle and the group of analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle that preserve the orientation. Then we construct the central extensions of the group $\mathcal G$ by the group ${\mathbb C}^*$. The first central extension, so-called the determinant central extension, is constructed by means of determinants of linear operators acting in infinite-dimensional locally convex topological $\mathbb C$-vector spaces. Other central extensions are constructed by $\cup$-products of group $1$-cocycles with the application to them the map related with algebraic $K$-theory. We prove in the second cohomology group, i.e. modulo of a group $2$-coboundary, the equality of the $12$th power of the $2$-cocycle constructed by the first central extension and the product of integer powers of the $2$-cocycles constructed above by means of \linebreak $\cup$-products (in multiplicative notation). As an application of this result we obtain a new topological Riemann-Roch theorem for a complex line bundle $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$, where $π:M \to B$ is a fibration in oriented circles. More precisely, we prove that in the group $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ the element $12 \, [ {\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is equal to the element $6 \, π_* ( c_1(L) \cup c_1(L))$, where $[{\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is the class of the determinant gerbe on $B$ constructed by $L$ and the determinant central extension.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A semidomain is a subsemiring of an integral domain. One can think of a semidomain as an integral domain in which additive inverses are no longer required. A semidomain $S$ is additively reduced if $0$ is the only invertible element of the monoid $(S,+)$, while $S$ is additively atomic if the monoid $(S,+)$ is atomic (i.e., every non-invertible element $s \in S$ can be written as the sum of finitely many irreducibles of $(S,+)$). In this paper, we describe the additively reduced and additively atomic semidomains $S$ for which every Laurent series $f \in S[[x^{\pm 1} ]]$ that is not a monomial can be written as the sum of at most three multiplicative irreducibles. In particular, we show that, for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$, every polynomial $f \in \mathbb{N}[x_1^{\pm 1}, \ldots, x_k^{\pm 1}]$ that is not a monomial can be written as the sum of two multiplicative irreducibles provided that $f(1, \ldots, 1) > 3$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A(s) = \sum_n a_n n^{-s}$ be a Dirichlet series with meromorphic continuation. Say we are given information on the poles of $A(s)$ with $|\Im s| \leq T$ for some large constant $T$. What is the best way to use such finite spectral data to give explicit estimates on sums $\sum_{n\leq x} a_n$? The problem of giving explicit bounds on the Mertens function $M(x) = \sum_{n\leq x} μ(n)$ illustrates how open this basic question was. Bounding $M(x)$ might seem equivalent to estimating $ψ(x) = \sum_{n\leq x} Λ(n)$ or the number of primes $\leq x$. However, we have long had fairly good explicit bounds on prime counts, while bounding $M(x)$ remained a notoriously stubborn problem. We prove a sharp, general result on sums $\sum_{n\leq x} a_n n^{-σ}$ for $a_n$ bounded, giving an optimal way to use information on the poles of $A(s)$ with $|\Im s|\leq T$ and no data on the poles above. Our bounds on $M(x)$ are stronger than previous ones by many orders of magnitude. (Similar results for $ψ(x)$ are given in a companion paper.) Using rigorous residue computations by D. Platt, we obtain, for $x\geq 1$, $$|M(x)|\leq \frac{3}{π\cdot 10^{10}}\cdot x + 11.39 \sqrt{x}.$$ This is a corollary of our main result, essentially an explicit formula with the contribution of each pole clearly stated; we shall discuss how this finer structure can be useful. Our proof mixes a Fourier-analytic approach in the style of Wiener--Ikehara with contour-shifting, using optimal approximants of Beurling--Selberg type (Carneiro--Littmann, 2013); for $σ=1$, the approximant in (Vaaler, 1985) reappears. While we proceed independently of existing explicit work on $M(x)$ and $ψ(x)$, our method has an important step in common with work on another problem by (Ramana--Ramaré, 2020).</p></details>

Motivated by the Hardy-Littlewood circle method, we introduce the notions of abstract exponential sums modulo $p^m$ and motivic oscillation index of an arbitrary ideal in polynomial rings over number fields. In the arithmetic picture, the abstract exponential sums modulo $p^m$ and the motivic oscillation index of an ideal should play the role of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial and its maximal non-trivial root of the corresponding scheme. We will provide some properties of the motivic oscillation index of ideals in this paper. On the other hand, based on Igusa's conjecture for exponential sums, we propose the averaged Igusa conjecture for exponential sums of ideals. In particular, this conjecture and the motivic oscillation index of ideals will have many interesting applications. We will introduce these applications and prove some variant version of this conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the low-lying zeros of certain Artin $L$-functions associated with $D_4$-quartic function fields. Specifically, we prove that when ordered by conductor, at least $77\%$ of these $L$-functions are non-vanishing at the central point. This generalises and extends results over $\mathbb{Q}$ due to Durlanik, proving that an infinite number of these $L$-functions are non-vanishing. We obtain these results by examining the low-lying zeros of the $L$-functions using the one-level density. Specifically, we apply and extend a method used by Rudnick, who studied Dirichlet $L$-functions associated with quadratic function field extensions, to the $D_4$-case. The main difficulty is studying $L$-functions which are associated to $D_4$-fields whose quadratic subfield is of large discriminant. These $L$-functions are studied by utilising the so-called flipped field of a $D_4$ extension, combining a method introduced by Friedrichsen for counting $D_4$-fields, with explicit ramification theory in such fields provided by Altuğ, Shankar, Varma and Wilson.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let Y be a random variable whose moment generating function exists in a neighborhood of the origin. Recently, probabilistic Stirling numbers of the first kind and of the second kind associated with Y have been introduced. However, probabilistic stirling number of the first kind based on the cumulant generating function of Y, and probabilistic stirling number of the second kind do not satisfy orthogonality and inverse relations. This paper aims to redefine the probabilistic stirling numbers of the first kind associated with Y such that probabilistic stiirling number of the first kind and probabilistic stirling number of the second kind do satisfy these crucial relations. Furthermore, we investigate their degenerate counterparts, the probabilistic degenerate Stirling numbers of both kinds. We explicitly compute probabilistic stiirling number of the first kind and probabilistic stirling number of the second kind .</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the behavior of Selmer groups of an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ in finite Galois extensions with prescribed Galois group. Fix a prime $\ell \geq 5$, a finite group $G$ with $\#G = \ell^n$, and an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ with $Sel_\ell(E/\mathbb{Q}) = 0$ and surjective mod-$\ell$ Galois representation. We show that there exist infinitely many Galois extensions $F/\mathbb{Q}$ with Galois group $Gal(F/\mathbb{Q}) \simeq G$ for which the $\ell$-Selmer group $Sel_\ell(E/F)$ also vanishes. We obtain an asymptotic lower bound for the number $M(G, E; X)$ of such fields $F$ with absolute discriminant $|Δ_F|\leq X$, proving that there is an explicit constant $δ>0$ such that $M(G, E; X) \gg X^{\frac{1}{\ell^{n-1}(\ell - 1)}} (\log X)^{δ- 1}$. The asymptotic for $M(G, E; X)$ matches the conjectural count for all $G$-extensions $F/\mathbb{Q}$ for which $|Δ_F|\leq X$, up to a power of $\log X$. This demonstrates that Selmer stability is not a rare phenomenon.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The twisted fourth moment of the Riemann zeta-function was established by Hughes and Young [J. Reine Angew.

In applications one would often like to take the Dirichlet polynomial to mimic either $1/ζ^r(s)$ (a mollifier) or $ζ(s)^r$ (an amplifier) for some $r>0$. Previous known results include the mean value of the fourth power of $ζ(s)$ times the square or the fourth power of a mollifier, or the square of an amplifier. In this paper we obtain the asymptotic formula for the fourth moment of the Riemann zeta-function times the fourth power of an amplifier. This has various applications to the theory of the Riemann zeta-function, e.g. gaps between zeros of $ζ(s)$ and lower bounds for moments.</p></details>

We then explain some classical $p$-adic functional analytic results (§3) that go into defining the $p$-adic Banach space (§4) attached to a two-dimensional semi-stable representation $V_{k,{\mathcal L}}$ of the Galois group of ${\mathbb Q}_p$ of weight $k$ and ${\mathcal L}$-invariant ${\mathcal L}$ under the $p$-adic Local Langlands correspondence. We then sketch how to compute the reduction of a lattice in this Banach space, which along with the Iwahori mod $p$ LLC, allows one to completely determine the mod $p$ reduction of $V_{k,{\mathcal L}}$ for all weights $3 \leq k \leq p+1$ and all ${\mathcal L}$ for $p \geq 5$ (§5). These notes are a summary of our joint work with Anand Chitrao [CG24]. Emphasis is placed on motivation and background rather than completeness.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We adopt a formal and algebraic approach of Early \cite{E2} to study the positive tropical Grassmannian $\mathrm{Trop}^+ Gr_{k,n}$. Specifically, we deal with positroid subdivision of hypersimplex induced by translated blades from any maximal weakly separated collection. One of our main results gives a necessary and sufficient condition on a maximal weakly separated collection to form a positroid subdivision of a hypersimplex corresponding to a simplicial cone in $\rm Trop^+Gr_{k,n}$. For k = 2 our condition says that any weakly separated collection of two-elements sets gives such a simplicial cone, and all cones are of such a form. We also show that the maximality of any weakly separated collection is preserved under the boundary map, which armatively answers a question by Early in \cite{E1}. Plabic graphs, invented by Postnikov \cite{P}, are of use in proving this result. As a corollary, we get that all those positroid subdivisions are the finest. Thus, the flip of two maximal weakly separatedcollections corresponds to a pair of adjacent maximal cones in positive tropical Grassmannian.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer $x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$ for $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps $x\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In particular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$. This seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the conjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any correspondence between polynomials and positive integers. In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend their domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that correspond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power series. We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\colon F_2[[q]]\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$ otherwise, where $A,B\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some of these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive integers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that $T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the orbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two fixed points. Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these conjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by replacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic integer. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could settle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for both $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Revised exposition following referee comments, changed title, 67 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we apply stack theoretic ideas to the classification problem in Dieudonné theory. First, we use crystalline cohomology of classifying stacks to directly reconstruct the classical Dieudonné module of a finite, $p$-power rank, commutative group scheme $G$ over a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p>0$. As a consequence, we give a new, much shorter proof of the isomorphism $σ^* M(G) \simeq \mathrm{Ext}^1 (G, \mathcal{O}^{\mathrm{crys}})$ due to Berthelot--Breen--Messing using stacky methods combined with the theory of de Rham--Witt complexes. Additionally, we show that finite locally free commutative group schemes of $p$-power rank over a quasisyntomic base can be classified in terms of ``prismatic Dieudonné $F$-gauges", which we introduce by making constructions using (higher) classifying stacks. The latter generalizes the result of Anschütz and Le Bras on classification of $p$-divisible groups, which we also reprove using our approach. Along the way, we prove a description of cohomology with coefficients in group schemes, compatibility with Cartier duality, and reconstruction of Galois representations in terms of our prismatic Dieudonné $F$-gauges.</p></details>

We then define the generalized Euclid tree and prove that it converges to the classical Euclid tree up to a scalar multiple. Moreover, by means of cluster mutations, we exhibit an asymptotic phenomenon, up to some limit q, between the logarithmic generalized Markov tree and the classical Euclid tree. A rationality conjecture of q is then put forward.

We establish pointwise almost everywhere convergence of the multilinear polynomial ergodic averages $$A_{N; X, T_1,\ldots, T_k}^{P_1,\ldots, P_k}(f_1,\ldots, f_k)(x) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^Nf_1\big(T_1^{P_1(n)}x\big)\cdots f_k\big(T_k^{P_k(n)}x\big), \qquad x\in X, $$cas $N\to\infty$ for any functions $f_1, \ldots, f_k\in L^{\infty}(X)$. Besides a couple of results in the bilinear setting (when $k=2$ and then only for single transformations), this is the first pointwise result for general polynomial multilinear ergodic averages in arbitrary measure-preserving systems. This answers a question of Bergelson from 1996 in the affirmative for any polynomials with distinct degrees, and makes progress on the Furstenberg-Bergelson-Leibman conjecture. In this paper, we build a versatile multilinear circle method by developing the Ionescu-Wainger multiplier theorem for the set of canonical fractions, which gives a positive answer to a question of Ionescu and Wainger from 2005. We also establish sharp multilinear $L^p$-improving bounds and an inverse theorem in higher order Fourier analysis for averages over polynomial corner configurations, which we use to establish a multilinear analogue of Weyl's inequality and its real counterpart, a Sobolev smoothing inequality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The discrepancy sum $D_N(x,ρ)$ for irrational rotations has been of interest to mathematicians for over a century. While historically studied in an ``almost-everywhere'' or asymptotic sense, $D_N$ for finite N is increasingly an object of interest for its nontrivial properties that depend on the Diophantine properties of $ρ$. This behavior is periodic in N with respect to the quotients of the continued fraction convergents, which grow quickly for some irrationals. Thus the stable computation of the sum is necessary for forming conjectures about its properties. However, computing the exact value of the sum and its corresponding probability density function (pdf) is notoriously difficult due to numerical instability in the sum itself and the failure of sampling methods to capture its jump discontinuities. This paper presents a novel computational algorithm that fully defines the discrepancy function and its associated pdf through its discontinuities. This allows the calculation of $D_N(x,ρ)$ to machine precision with minimal storage in O(N) time. This vast improvement in computability over the O(N^2) naive version enables, for the first time, the direct computation of the exact pdf up to machine precision in O(N log N) time, and with it, key properties of the discrepancy: $ \|D_N \|_{\infty}$ (half of the support of the pdf), $ \|D_N \|_{2}^2$ (the variance of the pdf), and the kurtosis of the pdf. A key strength of the algorithm lies in its ability to produce clear, exact figures, allowing the development of mathematical intuition and the quick testing of conjectures. As an example, a newly conjectured pattern is presented: when $ρ$ is well-approximated by rational $\frac{p_n}{q_n}$, the pdf exhibits a predictable spiked-trapezoidal pattern when $N=kq_n$. These shapes degrade as $k$ increases, at a speed depending on how well $\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ approximates $ρ$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p_n$ denote the $n$-th prime. In 2000, Panaitopol established the inequality $p_1 \cdots p_n > p_{n+1}^{n - π(n)}$ for all $n \geq 2$, where $π(x)$ is the prime counting function. In 2021, Yang and Liao refined this by introducing the exponent $k(n,x) = n - π(n) + \frac{π(n)}{π(\log n)} - x \cdot π(π(n))$, proving the inequality holds for $x = 2$ and $n \geq 8$. In 2022, Marques and Trojovský extended this to $x = 1.4$ for $n \geq 21$ and conjectured its validity for $x = 0.1$ when $n \geq 24,154,953$. This paper confirms the conjecture by analyzing the error term $E_n(x) = \log(p_1 \cdots p_n) - k(n,x) \log p_{n+1}$. Also, we derive the asymptotic expansion to $E_n(x)$ demonstrating that it is positive for all sufficiently large $n$ when $x > -2$. For each $x > -2$, we identify a minimal integer $Ψ(x)$ such that $E_n(x) > 0$ for all $n \geq Ψ(x)$, precisely determining $Ψ(0.1) = 24,154,953$. Additionally, we establish effective upper bounds for $Ψ(x)$ both unconditionally and under the Riemann Hypothesis, with the conditional bounds showing a significant improvement. Our analysis fully resolves the conjecture and characterizes $Ψ(x)$ as a non-increasing, piecewise constant function, exhibiting discontinuities at a discrete set of threshold points. These results advance the understanding of Bonse-type inequalities and their asymptotic behavior.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The problem of finding short vectors in Euclidean lattices is a central hard problem in complexity theory. The case of module lattices (i.e., lattices which are also modules over a number ring) is of particular interest for cryptography and computational number theory. The hardness of finding short vectors in the asymptotic regime where the rank (as a module) is fixed is supporting the security of quantum-resistant cryptographic standards such as ML-DSA and ML-KEM. In this article we prove the average-case hardness of this problem for uniformly random module lattices (with respect to the natural invariant measure on the space of module lattices of any fixed rank). More specifically, we prove a polynomial-time worst-case to average-case self-reduction for the approximate Shortest Independent Vector Problem ($γ$-SIVP) where the average case is the (discretized) uniform distribution over module lattices, with a polynomially-bounded loss in the approximation factor, assuming the Extended Riemann Hypothesis. This result was previously known only in the rank-1 case (so-called ideal lattices). That proof critically relied on the fact that the space of ideal lattices is a compact group. In higher rank, the space is neither compact nor a group. Our main tool to overcome the resulting challenges is the theory of automorphic forms, which we use to prove a new quantitative rapid equidistribution result for random walks in the space of module lattices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod n homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}$. As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod n homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected, area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated, and products of area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically area-minimizing. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f:\mathbb{A}^N\to\mathbb{A}^N$ be a regular endomorphism of algebraic degree $d\geq2$ (i.e., $f$ extends to an endomorphism on $\mathbb{P}^N$ of algebraic degree $d$) defined over a number field. We prove that if the set of $f$-preperiodic cyclotomic points is Zariski-dense in $\mathbb{A}^N$, then some iterate $f^{\circ l}$ ($l\geq1$) is a quotient of a surjective algebraic group endomorphism $g:\mathbb{G}_m^N\to\mathbb{G}_m^N$, over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. This is a higher-dimensional generalization of a theorem of Dvornicich and Zannier on cyclotomic preperiodic points of one-variable polynomials. In fact, we prove a much more general rigidity result for all dominant endomorphisms $f$ on an affine variety $X$ defined over a number field, regarding "almost $f$-invariant" Zariski-dense subsets of cyclotomic integral points. As applications, we also apply our results to backward orbits of regular endomorphisms on $\mathbb{A}^N$ of algebraic degree $d\geq2$, and to periodic points of automorphisms of Hénon type on $\mathbb{A}^N$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we introduce a class of `parabolic' subgroups for the generalized braid group associated to an arbitrary irreducible complex reflection group, which maps onto the collection of parabolic subgroups of the reflection group. Except for one case, which is proven separately elsewhere, we prove that this collection forms a lattice, so that intersections of parabolic subgroups are parabolic subgroups. In particular, every element admits a parabolic closure, which is the smallest parabolic subgroup containing it. We furthermore prove that it provides a simplicial complex which generalizes the curve complex of the usual braid group. In the case of real reflection groups, this complex generalizes the one previously introduced by Cumplido, Gebhardt, González-Meneses and Wiest for Artin groups of spherical type.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Jensen, Su, and Yang described the projective indecomposable modules of the $0$-Schur algebra $\mathbf{S}_0(n,r)$ using its geometric realization. In this paper, the simple modules of $\mathbf{S}_0(n,r)$ are identified by computing the tops of the projective indecomposable modules. Furthermore, functorial relations among the module categories $\mathbf{H}_r(0)$\textsf{-mod}, $\mathbf{S}_0(n,r)$\textsf{-mod}, and $U_0(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$\textsf{-mod} are examined, where $\mathbf{H}_r(0)$ denotes the $0$-Hecke algebra and $U_0(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ denotes the degenerate quantum group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\Bbbk$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $2$ and let $\mathfrak{fsl}(2)$ be the unique, up to isomorphism, $3$-dimensional simple Lie algebra over $\Bbbk$. Denote by $\mathfrak{m}$ the minimal $2$-envelope of $\mathfrak{fsl}(2)$ and by $\mathfrak{u}(\mathfrak{m})$ its corresponding restricted enveloping algebra. The non-isomorphic finite-dimensional indecomposable $\mathfrak{u}(\mathfrak{m})$-modules were classified in \cite{ABDF}. In this paper, the Green ring (or representation ring) for $\mathfrak{u}(\mathfrak{m})$ is calculated. Also, the semisimplification of the representation category of $\mathfrak{u}(\mathfrak{m})$ is determined.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** David W. Farmer &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Numerous small improvements based on referee comments. To appear in Bull AMS

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We examine published arguments which suggest that the Riemann Hypothesis may not be true. In each case we provide evidence to explain why the claimed argument does not provide a good reason to doubt the Riemann Hypothesis. The evidence we cite involves a mixture of theorems in analytic number theory, theorems in random matrix theory, and illustrative examples involving the characteristic polynomials of random unitary matrices. Similar evidence is provided for four mistaken notions which appear repeatedly in the literature concerning computations of the zeta-function. A fundamental question which underlies some of the arguments is: what does the graph of the Riemann zeta-function look like in a neighborhood of its largest values? We explore that question in detail and provide a survey of results on the relationship between L-functions and the characteristic polynomials of random matrices. We highlight the key role played by the emergent phenomenon of carrier waves, which arise from fluctuations in the density of zeros. The main point of this paper is that it is possible to understand some aspects of the zeta function at large heights, but the computation evidence is misleading.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 50 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a new approach to symmetry breaking for pairs of real forms of $(GL(n, \mathbb{C}), GL(n-1, \mathbb{C}))$. Translation functors are powerful tools for studying families of representations of a single reductive group $G$. However, when applied to a pair of groups $G \supset G'$, they can significantly alter the nature of symmetry breaking between the representations of $G$ and $G'$, even within the same Weyl chamber of the direct product group $G \times G'$. We introduce the concept of "fences for the interleaving pattern", which provides a refinement of the usual notion of walls of Weyl chambers. We then establish a theorem stating that the multiplicity remains constant unless these "fences" are crossed, together with a new general vanishing theorem for symmetry breaking. These general results are illustrated with examples involving both tempered and non-tempered representations. In addition, we present a new non-vanishing theorem for period integrals for pairs of reductive symmetric spaces, which is further strengthened by this approach.</p></details>

New results on the distribution of second class particles under the Ergodic blocking measure (conditional on a given conserved quantity)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider any fixed $d\in\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ number of second class particles in the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), constructed via a basic coupling of two ASEPs. We give the joint distribution of the positions of the second class particles and also the probability of there being a second class particle at a given site, under the natural blocking measure for ASEP. In order to find these distributions we use results about the number of particles in half-infinite and finite site ranges of ASEP. Our investigations also lead to probabilistic proofs of well-known combinatorial identities; the Durfee rectangles identity, Euler's identity, and the $q$-Binomial Theorem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article is a record of the lecture at the centennial conference for Harish-Chandra. The admissibility theorem of Harish-Chandra concerns the restrictions of irreducible representations to maximal compact subgroups. In this article, we begin with a brief explanation of two directions for generalizing his pioneering work to {\it{non-compact}} reductive subgroups: one emphasizes discrete decomposability with the finite multiplicity property, while the other focuses on finite/uniformly bounded multiplicity properties. We discuss how the recent representation-theoretic developments in these directions collectively offer a powerful method for the new spectral analysis of standard locally symmetric spaces, extending beyond the classical Riemannian setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A quantum graph $\mathcal{G}$ housed by a matrix algebra $M_n$ can be encoded as an operator system $\mathcal S=\mathcal{S}_{\mathcal{G}}\le M_n$. There are two sensible notions of quantum automorphism group for any such: $\mathrm{Qut}(\mathcal G)$, capturing the quantum symmetries of the adjacency matrix $A:M_n\to M_n$ attached to $\mathcal{G}$, and $\mathrm{Qut}(\mathcal S\le M_n)$, the quantum group acting universally on $M_n$ so as to preserve its $C^*$ structure, standard trace, and subspace $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$. The two quantum groups coincide classically, but diverge in general. We nevertheless show that both are generically trivial in the sense that they are so for $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$ ranging over a non-empty Zariski-open set under all reasonable dimensional constraints on $\dim \mathcal{S}$ and $n$. This extends analogous prior results by the first and third authors to the effect that classical symmetry groups of still-quantum graphs are generically trivial, and offers a fully quantum counterpart to the familiar probabilistic almost-rigidity of finite graphs. An auxiliary result sheds some light on the relationship between the two notions of quantum automorphism group, identifying the universal preserver of the quantum adjacency matrix of $\mathcal{G}$ with the quantum automorphism group not of $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$, but rather of the complex conjugate $\overline{\mathcal{S}}\le M_n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $N$ be a positive integer. For every $d\mid N$ such that $(d,N/d)=1$ there exists an Atkin-Lehner involution $w_d$ of the modular curve $X_0(N)$. Let $B(N)$ be the group of all such involutions. In this paper we determine all $\mathbb C$ and $\mathbb Q$-tetragonal quotient curves $X_0(N)/W_N$, where $W_N\subseteq B(N)$ such that $4\leq|W_N|\leq 2^{ω(N)-1}$, thus completing the classification of all $\mathbb C$-tetragonal quotients of $X_0(N)$ by Atkin-Lehner involutions.</p></details>
