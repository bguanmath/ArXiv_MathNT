### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11673v1'>2510.11673</a>\]&nbsp; **Integral Matrices of Fixed Rank over Number Fields**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nihar Gargava, Vlad Serban, Maryna Viazovska, Ilaria Viglino &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Our previous preprint 2402.10305 on this topic is broken into two different parts. This is one of the two parts

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an asymptotic formula for the number of fixed rank matrices with integer coefficients over a number field K/Q and bounded norm. As an application, we derive an approximate Rogers integral formula for discrete sets of module lattices obtained from lifts of algebraic codes. This in turn implies that the moment estimates of random lattices with a number field structure also carry through for large enough discrete sets of module lattices.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Franz Lemmermeyer &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In his notebooks, Gauss recorded various calculations with "infinite congruences". These infinite congruences are p-adic numbers; Gauss computes a square root of $5$ in the $11$-adic integers in order to find an $11$-adic approximation to a quadratic Gauss sum, computes a nontrivial square root of $1$ in $10$-adic integers, and computes the $10$-adic logarithms of small natural numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the derived Picard groups of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of surfaces in the sense of Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich and the related graded gentle algebras. An important ingredient in characteristic zero is the exponential map from Hochschild cohomology to the derived Picard group introduced in recent work by the author. To prove our results in positive characteristic, we combine deformation theory and formality results for Hochschild complexes. Along the way we show that the surface together with its decorations forms a complete derived invariant of partially wrapped Fukaya categories and we prove analogous results for graded gentle algebras. This removes all previous restrictions from earlier results of this kind.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Erman Isik, Antonio Lei &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 28 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the boundedness of the Mordell-Weil rank and the growth of the $v$-primary part of the Tate-Shafarevich group of $p$-supersingular abelian varieties of ${\rm GL}_2$-type with real multiplication over $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of number fields, where $v$ is a prime lying above $p$. Building on the work of Iovita-Pollack in the case of elliptic curves, under precise ramification and splitting conditions on $p$, we construct explicit systems of local points using the theory of Lubin-Tate formal groups. We then define signed Coleman maps, which in turn allow us to formulate and analyse signed Selmer groups. Assuming these Selmer groups are cotorsion, we prove that the Mordell-Weil groups are bounded over any subextensions of the $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension and provide an asymptotic formula for the growth of the $v$-primary part of the Tate-Shafarevich groups. Our results extend those of Kobayashi, Pollack, and Sprung on $p$-supersingular elliptic curves.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Dmitry Artamonov &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 32 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The paper presents a construction of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$. The representation space is constructed as the space of solutions to a certain system of partial differential equations of hypergeometric type, which is closely related to the Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky systems. This connection allows for the construction of a basis in the representation. The orthogonalization of the constructed basis with respect to the invariant scalar product turns out to be a Gelfand-Tsetlin-type basis for the chain of subalgebras $\mathfrak{g}_2 \supset \mathfrak{sl}_3$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11477v1'>2510.11477</a>\]&nbsp; **Moduli of lattice-polarized K3 surfaces and boundedness of Brauer groups**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Danny Bragg, Emma Brakkee, Anthony VÃ¡rilly-Alvarado &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Preliminary version. 55 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Inspired by constructions over the complex numbers of Dolgachev and Alexeev-Engel, we define moduli stacks $\mathcal{M}_{(L,\mathcal{A})/\mathbb{Z}}$ of lattice-polarized K3 surfaces over arbitrary bases, paying particular attention to the open locus $\mathcal{P}_{(L,\mathcal{A})/\mathbb{Z}}$ of primitive lattice polarizations. We introduce the notion of very small ample cones $\mathcal{a}$, after Alexeev and Engel's small cones, to construct smooth, separated stacks of lattice polarized K3 surfaces $\mathcal{P}_{(L,\mathcal{a})/\mathbb{Z}[1/N]}$ over suitable open subsets of $\textrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$. We add level structures, coming from classes in $\mathrm{H}^2(X,\mu_n)$, to build moduli stacks $\mathcal{P}^{[n]}_{(L,\mathcal{A})/\mathbb{Z}}$ with a natural action by $\mathcal{P}_{(L,\mathcal{A})}\otimes \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ whose associated quotient $\mathcal{Q}^{[n]}_{(L,\mathcal{A})}$ contains an open substack $\mathcal{Q}^{(n)}_{(L,\mathcal{A})}$ whose points parametrize pairs K3 surfaces $X$ such that $\textrm{Pic}(X) \simeq L$, together with a class $\alpha \in \textrm{Br}(X)$ of order $n$. When $L$ has rank 19, we show that the coarse moduli space $\mathrm{Q}_{(L,\mathcal{a}),\mathbb{C}}^{(n)}$ is a union of quasi-projective curves, each isomorphic to an open subvariety of the quotient of the upper half plane by a discrete subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$. Fixing a prime $\ell$, we use this comparison to prove that the genus and the gonality of the components of $\mathrm{Q}_{(L,\mathcal{a}),\mathbb{C}}^{(\ell^{m})}$ grows with $m$, and hence that they have finitely many points over number fields of bounded degree. As an application, we furnish a new proof of a result by Cadoret--Charles, showing uniform boundedness of the $\ell$-primary torsion of Brauer groups of K3 surfaces over number fields varying in a $1$-dimensional lattice-polarized family.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Dedicated to G\'erard Laumon

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article establishes a geometric Satake equivalence for affine Kac-Moody groups as an equivalence of abelian semisimple categories over algebraically closed fields. We define a well-behaved category of equivariant sheaves on the double affine grassmannian \Gr_{G}, seen as a infty-stack, that we equip with a t-structure. We obtain an Braden's hyperbolic localization theorem for such a stack and prove that the constant term functor is t-exact using dimension estimates for affine MV-cycles. We then deduce the sought-for equivalence and prove that the IC-complexes match with the irreducible highest weight representations of the Langlands dual group G^{\vee}.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11464v1'>2510.11464</a>\]&nbsp; **On modular invariants of the truncated polynomial ring in rank four**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Dang Vo Phuc &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AC &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 25 pages. We welcome any constructive discussions and comments

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the rank-4 case of the conjecture of Ha-Hai-Nghia for the invariant subspace of the truncated polynomial ring $\mathcal{Q}_m(n)=\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dots,x_n]/(x_1^{q^m},\dots,x_n^{q^m}),$ under a new, explicit technical hypothesis. Our argument extends the determinant calculus for the delta operator by deriving crucial rank-4 identities governing its interaction with the Dickson algebra. We show that the proof of the conjecture reduces to a specific vanishing property, for which we introduce a sufficient condition, the "matching hypothesis" H$_{\mathrm{match}}$}, relating the degree structures of Dickson invariants. This condition is justified by theoretical arguments and verified computationally in many cases. Combining this approach with the normalized derivation approach from our prior work, we establish the conjecture. As a result, the Lewis-Reiner-Stanton Conjecture is also confirmed for rank four under the given hypothesis.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** James S. Milne &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** v2. 72 pages. Improved exposition

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Much of the work on Shimura varieties over the last thirty years has been devoted to constructing the theory that would follow from a good notion of motives, one incorporating the Hodge, Tate, and standard conjectures. These conjectures are believed to be beyond reach, and may not even be correct as stated. I argue in this article that there exists a theory of motives, accessible to proof, weaker than Grothendieck's, but with many of the same consequences.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16536v2'>2507.16536</a>\]&nbsp; **MÃ¶bius inversion and coprime summation for error-sum functions of continued fractions**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Min Woong Ahn &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 24 pages, typos corrected, Lemma 4.1 added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the unweighted error-sum function $\mathcal{E}(x) \coloneqq \sum_{n \geq 0} ( x- p_n(x)/q_n(x) )$, where $p_n(x)/q_n(x)$ is the $n$th convergent of the continued fraction expansion of $x \in \mathbb{R}$. We prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of $\mathcal{E}$ is exactly equal to $1$. Our proof is number-theoretic in nature and involves M\"obius inversion, summation over coprime convergent denominators, and precise upper bounds derived via continued fraction recurrence relations. As a supplementary result, we rederive the known upper bound of $3/2$ for the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of the relative error-sum function $P(x) \coloneqq \sum_{n \geq 0} (q_n(x)x-p_n(x))$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** OÄuz GezmiÅ, Sriram Chinthalagiri Venkata &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Replaced with the published version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X$ be a smooth projective and geometrically irreducible curve over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ elements and $K$ be its function field. Let $\infty$ be a fixed closed point on $X$ and $A$ be the ring of functions regular away from $\infty$. In the present paper, by generalizing the previous work of Chen and the first author, we introduce the notion of nearly holomorphic Drinfeld modular forms for congruence subgroups of $GL_2(K)$ as continuous but non-holomorphic functions on a certain subdomain of the Drinfeld upper half plane. By extending the de Rham sheaf to a compactification $\overline{M_I^2}$ of the Drinfeld moduli space $M_I^2$, we also describe such forms algebraically as global sections of an explicitly described sheaf on $\overline{M_I^2}$ as well as construct a comparison isomorphism between analytic and algebraic description of them. Furthermore, we show the transcendence of special values of nearly holomorphic Drinfeld modular forms at CM points and relate them to the periods of CM Drinfeld $A$-modules.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 41 pages, comments welcome, v2) updated references, v3) switched to TeX Live 2023

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We exhibit gluing properties of cluster tilting subcategories in exact $\infty$-categories within the framework of perverse schobers on surfaces with boundary. These results are based on a study of the restriction functors from global sections of perverse schobers to local sections and their adjoint induction functors. New examples include cluster tilting subcategories in higher rank topological Fukaya categories related to higher Teichm\"uller theory, and cluster tilting subcategories arising from marked surfaces with punctures.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 29 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper extends a recent extreme value law for horocycle flows on the space of two-dimensional lattices, due to Kirsebom and Mallahi-Karai, to the simplest examples of rank-$k$ unipotent actions on the space of $n$-dimensional lattices. We analyse the problem in terms of the hitting time and impact statistics for the unipotent action with respect to a shrinking surface of section, following the strategy of Pollicott and the first named author in the case of hyperbolic surfaces. If $k=n-1$, the limit law is given by directional statistics of Euclidean lattices, whilst for $k<n-1$ we observe new distributions for which we derive precise tail asymptotics.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 40 pages, 7 figures, improved exposition, corrected typos and added the last few missing cases (some flag varieties of SO(q,q))

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We count the number of connected components in the space of triples of transverse flags in any flag manifold of $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$. We compute the effect the involution of the unipotent radical has on those components and deduce that for certain parabolic subgroups $P_{\Theta}$, any $P_{\Theta}$-Anosov subgroup is virtually isomorphic to either a surface group of a free group. We give examples of Anosov subgroups which are neither free nor surface groups for some sets of roots which do not fall under the previous results. As a consequence of the methods developed here, we get an explicit algorithm based on computation of minors to check if a unipotent matrix in $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$ belong to the $\Theta$-positive semigroup $U_\Theta^{>0}$ when $p\neq q$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 16 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study some supercongruences involving the sequence $$ t_n(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}\binom{x}{k}\binom{x+k}{k}2^k $$ and solve some open problems. For any odd prime $p$ and $p$-adic integer $x$, we determine $\sum_{n=0}^{p-1}t_n(x)^2$ and $\sum_{n=0}^{p-1}(n+1)t_n(x)^2$ modulo $p^2$; for example, we establish that \begin{align*} \sum_{n=0}^{p-1}t_n(x)^2\equiv\begin{cases} \left(\dfrac{-1}{p}\right)\pmod{p^2},&\text{if }2x\equiv-1\pmod{p},\\[8pt] (-1)^{\langle x\rangle_p}\dfrac{p+2(x-\langle x\rangle_p)}{2x+1}\pmod{p^2},&\text{otherwise,} \end{cases} \end{align*} where $\langle x\rangle_p$ denotes the least nonnegative residue of $x$ modulo $p$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the sum of additive characters over finite fields, with a focus on those of specified \(\mathbb{F}_q\)-Order. We establish a general formula for these character sums, providing an additive analogue to classical results previously known for multiplicative characters. As an application, we derive a M\"obius function \(\mu(g)\) for polynomials \(g \in \mathbb{F}_q[x]\), analogous to the integer M\"obius function \(\mu(n)\), and develop a characteristic function for \(k\)-normal elements. We also generalize several classical identities from the integer setting to the polynomial setting, highlighting the structural parallels between these two domains.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring. We establish a close relationship between the strong generation of the singularity category of R and the nonvanishing of the annihilator of the singularity category of R. As an application, we prove that the singularity category of R has a strong generator if and only if the annihilator of the singularity category of R is nonzero when R is a Noetherian domain with Krull dimension at most one. We introduce the notion of the co-cohomological annihilator of modules. If the category of finitely generated R-modules has a strong generator, we show that the infinite injective dimension locus of a finitely generated R-module M is closed, with the defining ideal given by the co-cohomological annihilator of M. Finally, we provide a connection between the existence of an extension generator of the category of finitely generated R-modules and the finiteness of the Krull dimension of R.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Interpolation polynomials were introduced by Knop--Sahi in type $A$, and Okounkov in type $BC$. They are inhomogeneous polynomials whose top terms are Jack and Macdonald polynomials. Thus the expansion coefficients for the product of two interpolation polynomials, known as Littlewood--Richardson coefficients, generalize the corresponding coefficients for Jack/Macdonald polynomials. Special values of interpolation polynomials, known as binomial coefficients, arise in the binomial type expansions of Jack/Macdonald polynomials and Koornwinder polynomials. We prove a number of results for interpolation polynomials and the associated coefficients. These include positivity and monotonicity results for binomial coefficients, partial positivity results for Littlewood--Richardson coefficients, and weighted sum formulas for both kinds of coefficients. As a special case of our results we obtain a new symmetric function inequality, which establishes a ``duality'' between Jack expansion positivity for symmetric functions, and the containment order on partitions, with respect to the shifted basis $\Omega_\lambda({\bf1}+x;\tau)$, where ${\bf1} =(1,\ldots,1)$ and $\Omega_\lambda(x;\tau)=P_\lambda(x;\tau)/P_\lambda({\bf1};\tau)$ is the normalized Jack polynomial. Our inequality can be seen as an analog of the inequalities of Cuttler--Greene--Skandera+Sra and Khare--Tao, which establish similar dualities between evaluation positivity on the positive orthant, and the dominance and weak dominance orders on partitions, with respect to the normalized Schur basis $\Omega_\lambda(x)=s_\lambda(x)/s_\lambda({\bf1})$ and its shifted version $\Omega_\lambda({\bf1}+x)$, respectively. In contrast to our result, the Jack versions of the two latter inequalities, although expected to hold, have not yet been proved.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In number theory, many major results related to the twin prime and Goldbach conjectures are proven using the methods of sieve theory. However, in nearly every case, the existing proofs of these results are ineffective, in that explicit values for which they hold cannot be computed. The reason for this ineffectivity is due to the reliance on the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem. In this paper, we show that any classical sifting problem with a Bombieri-Vinogradov style error term can in fact be made effective, with no loss to the asymptotic form of the original (ineffective) result. This is done by carefully modifying the sieve upper and lower bounds as to avoid the usual complications regarding the existence of a Siegel zero. We also provide some simple applications. For example, we show that one may effectively bound the number of primes $p\leq x$ such that $p+2$ is also prime by \begin{equation*} (4+o(1))C_2\frac{x}{(\log x)^2}, \end{equation*} where \begin{equation*} C_2=2\prod_{p>2}\left(1-\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\right) \end{equation*} is the twin-prime constant.</p></details>

We show that if the embedding of a connected subcategory $\mathcal{J}$ is both initial and final, then the restriction of any $\mathcal{C}$-module along $\mathcal{J}$ preserves the generalized rank-or equivalently, the multiplicity of the ``entire" interval modules for $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{J}$. Conversely, we prove that this property characterizes initial and final embeddings when both $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{J}$ are posets satisfying certain mild constraints and the embedding is full. For $\mathcal{C}$ a poset under these conditions, we describe the minimal full subposet whose embedding is initial or final. We also extend a result of Kinser on the generalized rank invariant to small categories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe the obstruction to decomposing in degrees $\leq p$ the de Rham complex of a smooth variety over a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p$ that lifts over $W_2(k)$, and show that there exist liftable smooth projective varieties of dimension $p+1$ whose Hodge-to-de Rham spectral sequence does not degenerate at the first page. We also describe the action of the Sen operator on the de Rham complex in degrees $\leq p$ and give examples of varieties with a non-semisimple Sen operator. Our methods rely on the commutative algebra structure on de Rham and Hodge-Tate cohomology, and are inspired by the properties of Steenrod operations on cohomology of cosimplicial commutative algebras. The example of a non-degenerate Hodge-to-de Rham spectral sequence relies on a non-vanishing result on cohomology of groups of Lie type. We give applications to other situations such as describing extensions in the canonical filtration on de Rham, Hodge, and \'etale cohomology of an abelian variety equipped with a group action. We also show that the de Rham complex of a smooth variety over $k$ is formal as an $E_{\infty}$-algebra if and only if the variety lifts to $W_2(k)$ together with its Frobenius endomorphism.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical fiber product in algebraic geometry provides a powerful tool for studying loci where two morphisms to a base scheme, $\phi: X \to S$ and $\psi: Y \to S$, coincide exactly. This condition of strict equality, however, is insufficient for describing many real-world applications. This paper develops a new framework to study and quantify the nature of approximate alignment between morphisms in the context of arithmetic geometry, using the tools of {\'e}tale homotopy theory. We introduce the central object of our work, the \textit{{\'e}tale mismatch torsor}, a sheaf of torsors over the product scheme $X \times_S Y$. The structure of this sheaf serves as a rich, intrinsic, and purely algebraic object amenable to both qualitative classification and quantitative analysis of the global relationship between the two morphisms. Our main results are twofold. First, we provide a complete classification of these structures, establishing a bijection between their isomorphism classes and the first {\'e}tale cohomology group $H_{\text{\'e}t}^1(X \times_S Y, \underline{\pi_1^{\text{\'e}t}(S)})$. Second, we construct a canonical filtration on this classifying cohomology group based on the theory of infinitesimal neighborhoods. This filtration induces a new invariant, which we term the \textit{order of mismatch}, providing a hierarchical, algebraic measure for the degree of approximation between the morphisms. We apply this framework to the concrete case of generalized Howe curves over finite fields, demonstrating how both the characteristic class and its order reveal subtle arithmetic properties.</p></details>

We also noticed that for such number fields, when the Hilbert class field is an abelian extension of $\mathbb{Q}$, we can get a better bound towards the $\ell-$torsion conjecture. Along with these, the article reports some results in a theme developed by the authors, where primes of higher degree are used to study class groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $S(a,b;n)$ be the Kloosterman sum. For any integers $a\neq0,b\neq0,k\geqslant2$, any given complex number $\eta\not=0$ and multiplicative function $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, we show that $$ |\{n\leqslant X:S(a,b;n)=\eta f(n), n \text{ square-free }k\text{-almost prime}\}|\leqslant \pi(\dfrac{X}{L_k})+O(X^{1-\frac{1}{2k}}) $$ and $$ |\{n\leqslant X:S(a,b;n)=\eta f(n), n \text{ square-free}\}|\leqslant \pi(X)+O(Xe^{-\sqrt{\log X}}) $$ as $X\rightarrow \infty$. Here, $L_{k}$ denotes the product of the first $(k-1)$ primes and $\pi(X)$ is the number of primes $\leqslant X$. By providing some examples for which the equality holds, we also prove that these two inequalities are sharp. In particular, these estimates imply that $S(a,b;n)\neq\eta f(n)$ holds for $100\%$ square-free $k$-almost prime numbers and $100\%$ square-free numbers $n$. Counterintuitively, if $S(a,b;p)=\eta f(p)$ holds for all but finitely many primes $p$, we further show that \begin{align*} |\{n\leqslant X:S(a,b;n)=\eta f(n), n \text{ square-free }k\text{-almost prime}\}|\leqslant (|a|+|b|+2k)X^{\frac{k}{k+1}}+O(1). \end{align*} All these demonstrate that $S(a,b;n)$ with fixed $a\neq0$ and $b\neq0$, as an arithmetic function of $n\in\mathbb{N}$ is intrinsically distinct from any complex valued multiplicative function. Similarly, we also show that all these results still hold with the Birch sum $B(a,b;n)$ or the Sali\'e sum $\widetilde{S}(a,b;n)$ in place of $S(a,b;n)$ if and only if the integer pair $a,b$ satisfies some natural conditions respectively.</p></details>

We construct the iGKLO representations of ${}^\imath Y_\mu$, which factor through quotients known as truncated shifted twisted Yangians (TSTY) ${}^\imath Y_\mu^\lambda$. In type AI with $\mu$ dominant, a variant of ${}^\imath Y_\mu^{N\varpi_1^\vee}$ is identified with the TSTY in another definition which are isomorphic to finite W-algebras of type BCD. We show that ${}^\imath Y_\mu$ quantizes the involutive fixed point locus ${}^\imath W_\mu$ arising from affine Grassmannians of type ADE, and expect that ${}^\imath Y_\mu^\lambda$ quantizes a top-dimensional component of the affine Grassmannian islice ${}^\imath{\bar{W}}_\mu^\lambda$. We identify the islices ${}^\imath{\bar{W}}_\mu^\lambda$ in type AI with suitable nilpotent Slodowy slices of type BCD, building on the work of Lusztig and Mirkovi\'c-Vybornov in type A. We propose a framework for producing ortho-symplectic (and hybrid) Coulomb branches from split (and nonsplit) Satake framed double quivers, which are conjectured to provide a normalization of the islices ${}^\imath{\bar{W}}_\mu^\lambda$.</p></details>

This is analogous to a known fact about the topological fundamental group of an open subset of a normal complex analytic variety.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, the second Kronecker ``limit" formula for a real quadratic field is established for the first time. More precisely, we obtain the second Kronecker limit formula of Zagier's zeta function. Using the reduction theory of Zagier, which connects Zagier's zeta function to the zeta function of real quadratic fields, we express the values of the zeta function of narrow ideal classes in real quadratic fields at natural arguments in terms of an analytic function which we call the \emph{higher Herglotz-Zagier-Novikov function} and denote it by $\mathscr{F}_k(x; \alpha, \beta)$. This function plays a central role in our study. The function $\mathscr{F}_k(x; \alpha, \beta)$ possesses elegant properties, for example, we prove that it satisfies the two, three and six-term functional equations. As a result of our Kronecker limit formula and functional equations, we provide another expression for the combinations of zeta values. Finally, we interpret our Kronecker ``limit" formula in terms of cohomological relations and establish a connection between $\mathscr{F}_k(x; \alpha, \beta)$ and a generalized Dedekind-eta function.</p></details>

We transform this asymptotic formula into an effective recurrence by proving that a finite parameter $s \leq p_n$ suffices when combined with the ceiling function, establishing a constructive method valid for all $n \geq 1$. The minimal integer parameter $s_n$ (OEIS A389650) reveals deep connections to prime constellations. We prove $\liminf_{n\to\infty} \sigma_n = 0$ unconditionally, where $\sigma_n = s_n/p_n$. The limit superior $C = \limsup \sigma_n$ satisfies $\log \psi \lesssim C \leq 0.4332$, where $\psi \approx 1.46557$ is the supergolden ratio. The lower bound is conditional on the twin prime conjecture; the upper bound is unconditional. The constant $C$ relates to the densest admissible prime constellation, connecting to the Hardy--Littlewood conjectures. The method extends to Dirichlet L-functions, yielding other effective formulas for calculating $p_{n+1}$ but also for predicting residues of $p_{n+1}$ modulo any integer with reduced precision requirements.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Building on the Atiyah--Singer holomorphic Lefschetz fixed-point theorem, we define ramification modules associated to the fixed loci of a finite group acting on a compact complex manifold. This allows us to generalize the Chevalley--Weil formula for compact Riemann surfaces to higher dimensions. More precisely, let $G$ be a finite group acting on a compact complex manifold $X$, and let $\mathcal{E}$ be a $G$-equivariant locally free sheaf on $X$. Then, in the representation ring $R(G)_\mathbb{Q}$, we have $$ \chi_G(X, \mathcal{E}):=\sum_{i=0}^{\dim X}(-1)^i[H^i(X, \mathcal{E})]=\frac{1}{|G|}\chi(X,\mathcal{E})[\mathbb{C}[G]] + \sum_Z\Gamma(\mathcal{E})_Z $$ where $Z$ runs over all connected components of the fixed-point sets $X^g$ for $g\in G$, and each $\Gamma(\mathcal{E})_Z\in R(X)_\mathbb{Q}$, called the \emph{ramification module} at $Z$, depends only on the restriction $\mathcal{E}|_Z$ and the normal bundle $N_{Z/X}$ as $G_Z$-equivariant bundles. We illustrate the computation of $\Gamma(\mathcal{E})_Z$ in several special cases and provide a detailed example for faithful actions of $G\cong(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^n$ on a compact complex surface.</p></details>

Our results extend a recent classification of torsion equivariant line bundles with connection due to Ardakov and Wadsley, but we use a different approach. A crucial ingredient is a construction due to Van der Put which relates invertible analytic functions on the Drinfeld upper half plane to currents on the Bruhat-Tits tree.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, the second and third authors introduced a new symmetric tensor category $\underline{\mathrm{Perm}}(G, \mu)$ associated to an oligomorphic group $G$ with a measure $\mu$. When $G$ is the group of order preserving self-bijections of the real line there are four such measures, and the resulting tensor categories are called the Delannoy categories. The first Delannoy category is semi-simple, and was studied in detail by Harman, Snowden, and Snyder. We give universal properties for all four Delannoy categories in terms of ordered \'etale algebras. As a consequence, we show that the second and third Delannoy categories admit at least two local abelian envelopes, and the fourth admits at least four.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G=\langle x^d+c_1,\dots,x^d+c_s\rangle$ be a semigroup generated under composition for some $c_1,\dots,c_s\in\mathbb{Z}$ and some $d\geq2$. Then we prove that, outside of an exceptional one-parameter family, $G$ contains a large and explicit subset of irreducible polynomials if and only if it contains at least one irreducible polynomial. In particular, this conclusion holds when $G$ is generated by at least $s\geq3$ polynomials when $d$ is odd and at least $s\geq5$ polynomials when $d$ is even. To do this, we prove a classification result for prime powered iterates under $f(x)=x^d+c$ when $c\in\mathbb{Z}$ is nonzero. Namely, if $f^n(\alpha)=y^p$ for some $n\geq4$, some $\alpha,y\in\mathbb{Z}$, and some prime $p|d$, then $\alpha$ and $y^p$ are necessarily preperiodic and periodic points for $f$ respectively. Moreover, we note that $n=4$ is the smallest possible iterate for which one may make this conclusion.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study the family of trigonometric Gaudin subalgebras in $U g^{\otimes n}$ for arbitrary simple Lie algebra $g$. This is the family of commutative subalgebras of maximal possible transcendence degree that serve as a universal source for higher integrals of the trigonometric Gaudin quantum spin chain attached to $g$. We study the parameter space that indexes all possible degenerations of subalgebras from this family. In particular, we show that (rational) inhomogeneous Gaudin subalgebras of $ U g^{\otimes n}$ previously studied in \cite{ffry} arise as certain limits of trigonometric Gaudin subalgebras. Moreover, we show that both families of commutative subalgebras glue together into the one parameterized by the space $\overline{\mathcal F}_n$, which is the total space of degeneration of the Deligne-Mumford space of stable rational curves $ \overline M_{n+2} $ to the moduli space of cactus flower curves $ \overline F_n $ recently introduced in \cite{iklpr}. As an application, we show that trigonometric Gaudin subalgebras act on tensor products of irreducible finite-dimensional $g$-modules without multiplicities, under some explicit assumptions on the parameters in terms of two different real forms of $\overline M_{n+2}$. This gives rise to a monodromy action of the affine cactus group on the set of eigenstates for the trigonometric Gaudin model. We also explain the relation between the trigonometric Gaudin model and the quantum cohomology of affine Grassmannians slices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent study of the quantum theory of harmonic oscillators, Gerard 't Hooft proposed the following problem: given $G(z)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\sqrt{n}\,z^n$ for $|z|<1$, find its analytic continuation for $|z|\ge1$, excluding a branch-cut $z\in[1,\,\infty)$. A solution is provided by the bilateral convergent sum $G(z)=\frac12\sqrt{\pi}\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty(2\pi{\rm i}n-\log(z))^{-3/2}$. On the negative real axis, $G(-{\rm e}^u)$ has a sign-constant asymptotic expansion in $1/u^2$, for large positive $u$. Optimal truncation leaves exponentially suppressed terms in an asymptotic expansion ${\rm e}^{-u}\sum_{k=0}^\infty P_k(x)/u^k$, with $P_0(x)=x-\frac23$ and $P_k(x)$ of degree $2k+1$ evaluated at $x=u/2-\lfloor u/2\rfloor$. At large $k$, these polynomials become excellent approximations to sinusoids. The amplitude of $P_k(x)$ increases factorially with $k$ and its phase increases linearly, with $P_k(x)\sim\sin((2k+1)C-2\pi x)R^{2k+1}\Gamma(k+\frac12)/\sqrt{2\pi}$, where $C\approx1.0688539158679530121571$ and $R\approx0.5181839789815558726739$ are asymptotic constants satisfying $R\exp({\rm i}\,C)=\sqrt{-1/(2+\pi{\rm i})}$.</p></details>

Assume that $s(H;{\mathbf x})=\sum_{T\in\mathcal{T}(H)} \prod_{e\in E(T)} x_e$. Let $G$ be a maximal planar graph (arbitrary planar triangulation) such that each face $F$ is assigned the value $\alpha(F)=\pm 1 \in \mathbb{F}_3$. Then we can associate each edge with $x_e=\alpha(F'_e)+\alpha(F''_e)$, where $F'_e$ and $F''_e$ are the faces containing edge $e$. Let us define the value $w_G({\mathbf x})$ as $\left(\frac{s(G/W^*({\mathbf x});{\mathbf x})}3\right)/(-3)^{\left(|V(G/W^*({\mathbf x}))| - 1\right)/2}$; here $\left(\frac{x}3\right)$ is the Legendre symbol, $G/W$ is the graph with the contracted set of vertices $W$, while $W^*({\mathbf x})$ is a set of vertices $W$, $W \subseteq V(G)$, with minimal cardinality such that $s(G/W;{\mathbf x})$ differs from zero. In the following, we prove that the number of Tait colorings for graph $G$ equals the tripled sum $w_G({\mathbf x}(\alpha))$ with respect to all possible vectors $\alpha \in \{-1, 1\}^{\mathcal F(G)}$ such that $G/W^*({\mathbf x}(\alpha))$ has an odd number of vertices, where $\mathcal F(G)$ is the set of faces of graph $G$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present the Quantum Paldus Transform: an efficient quantum algorithm for block-diagonalising fermionic, spin-free Hamiltonians in the second quantisation. Our algorithm implements an isometry between the occupation number basis of a fermionic Fock space of $2d$ modes, and the Gelfand-Tsetlin (GT) states spanning irreducible representations of the group $U(d) \times SU(2)$. The latter forms a basis indexed by well-defined values of total particle number $N$, global spin $S$, spin projection $M$, and $U(d)$ GT patterns. This realises the antisymmetric unitary-unitary duality discovered by Howe and developed into the Unitary Group Approach (UGA) for computational chemistry by Paldus and Shavitt in the 1970s. The Paldus transform lends tools from the UGA readily applicable to quantum computational chemistry, leading to maximally sparse representations of spin-free Hamiltonians, efficient preparation of Configuration State Functions, and a direct interpretation of quantum chemistry reduced density matrix elements in terms of $SU(2)$ angular momentum coupling. The transform also enables the encoding of quantum information into novel Decoherence-Free Subsystems for use in communication and error mitigation. Our work can be seen as a generalisation of the quantum Schur transform for the second quantisation, made tractable by the Pauli exclusion principle. Alongside self-contained derivations of the underlying dualities we provide fault-tolerant circuit compilation methods with full gate counts for the Paldus transform, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(d^3)$ Toffoli complexity, where a transform on $50$ spatial orbitals would require a modest $5500$ Toffoli gates. This paves the way for significant advancements in quantum simulation on quantum computers enabled by the UGA paradigm.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a field $L$ of characteristic $p$, a polynomial $f \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p[x]$ and $\alpha, \beta \in L$, let $\mathrm{Prep}(f;\alpha,\beta)$ be the set of all $\lambda \in \overline{L}$ such that both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are preperiodic under the action of $f_{\lambda}(x) := f(x) + \lambda$. Ghioca and Hsia proved that for certain families of polynomials, this set is infinite if and only if $f(\alpha)=f(\beta)$ or $\alpha, \beta \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$. Building on their work, we determine when $\mathrm{Prep}(f;\alpha,\beta)$ is infinite for most of the remaining binomial cases that were left open. Specifically, let $f(x)=c_1 x^{d_1} + c_2 x^{d_2} \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p[x]$, where $c_i \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p^*$, $1 \le d_1 < d_2$ and $d_i=p^{\ell_i}s_i$ with $\ell_i \ge 0$ and $p \nmid s_i$. We prove that if $p^{\ell_2}(s_2-1) < p^{\ell_1}(s_1-1)$, then $\mathrm{Prep}(f;\alpha,\beta)$ is infinite if and only if $f(\alpha)=f(\beta)$ or $\alpha, \beta \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$. The key idea of the proof is to use the parameters $\lambda_{\overline{\alpha}} := \overline{\alpha} - f(\overline{\alpha})$ associated to suitable elements $\overline{\alpha} \in \overline{L}$ satisfying $f(\overline{\alpha})=f(\alpha)$. As an application, we extend the work of Asgarli and Ghioca on the colliding orbits problem to binomials satisfying $s_2>1$ and $p^{\ell_2}(s_2-1) < p^{\ell_1}(s_1-1)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a deterministic algorithm that, given a composite number $N$ and a target order $D \ge N^{1/6}$, runs in time $D^{1/2+o(1)}$ and finds either an element $a \in \mathbb{Z}_N^*$ of multiplicative order at least $D$, or a nontrivial factor of $N$. Our algorithm improves upon an algorithm of Hittmeir (arXiv:1608.08766), who designed a similar algorithm under the stronger assumption $D \ge N^{2/5}$.

When $N$ is assumed to have an $r$-power divisor with $r\ge 2$, our algorithm provides the same guarantees assuming $D \ge N^{1/6r}$.</p></details>

As applications of this, we derive Kronecker limit type formula in the second variable and a new infinite family of modular relations called mixed functional equations.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish Kronecker limit type formula for the generalized Mordell-Tornheim zeta function $\Theta(r,r,t,x)$ as a function of the third argument around $t=1-r$. We then show that the above Kronecker limit type formula is equivalent to the two-term functional equation for the higher Herglotz function obtained by Vlasenko and Zagier. We also show the equivalence between a previously known Kronecker limit type formula for $\Theta(1,1,t,x)$ around $t=0$ and the two-term functional equation for the Herglotz-Zagier function obtained by Zagier. Using the theory of the Mordell-Tornheim zeta function, we obtain results of Ramanujan, Guinand, Zagier, and Vlasenko-Zagier as consequences, to further show that the Mordell-Tornheim zeta function lies centrally between many modular relations in the literature, thus providing the means to view them under one umbrella.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a Galois number field $K$, the Galois group $\text{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$ acts on the class group $Cl_K$ in a very natural way: $\sigma\cdot[I]=[\sigma(I)]$ for any $\sigma \in \text{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$, $[I]\in Cl_K$. In this paper, we will explore how the unique properties of this group action work together to elucidate the relationship between these two groups. While previous work on this problem has focused on representation theory, we take a direct approach to some classical and new problems. The paper concludes with an exploration of the class groups of localizations of the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$. These turn out to be powerful tools for understanding $Cl_K$ and overrings of $\mathcal{O}_K$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix $g \geq 2$. Let $\mathsf{t}(g)$ be the maximal order of the translation group among all genus-$g$ abelian differentials. By work of Schlage-Puchta and Weitze-Schmith\"usen, $\mathsf{t}(g) \leq 4(g - 1)$. They also classify the $g$ attaining this bound. We assume $g$ is outside this class. We first prove that either $\mathsf{t}(g) = (2(m + 1) / m) (g - 1)$ for some $m \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, when regular genus-$g$ origamis exist, or $\mathsf{t}(g) = 2(g - 1)$, when they do not exist. In the former case, only some values of $m > 1$ are realizable; $m = 5$ is the smallest. The resulting set of genera, those satisfying $\mathsf{t}(g) = (12/5)(g - 1)$, contains infinitely long arithmetic progressions. The same holds for any odd prime $m$ congruent to $2$ modulo $3$. In the latter case, "many" strata of the form $\mathcal{H}(g - 1, g - 1)$, $\mathcal{H}(2k^q)$ or $\mathcal{H}(k^{2q})$, where $k \geq 1$ is an integer and $q$ is prime, contain no regular origamis; we derive a complete classification. As an application, we exhibit infinite families of genera $g$ for which $\mathsf{t}(g) = 2(g - 1)$: $g = p + 1$ for prime $p \geq 5$; $g = p^2 + 1$ for prime, but not Sophie Germain prime, $p$; and $g = pq + 1$, for distinct primes $p, q \geq 5$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop the theory of $\hbar$-vertex algebras, algebraic structures closely related to vertex algebras but with a deformed translation covariance axiom. We establish their structure theory, including analogues of Goddard's Uniqueness Theorem, the Reconstruction Theorem, Borcherds Identity, and the OPE Expansion Formula, and introduce the associated notions of $\hbar$-Lie conformal and $\hbar$-Poisson vertex algebras. The formalism provides a natural and simplified construction of the Zhu algebra. The main application is to the chiralization of classical star-products: we show that every star-product on the symmetric algebra of a Lie algebra (or its central extensions) admits a chiralization, and we derive explicit formulae for these chiral star-products, including the Moyal-Weyl and Gutt star-products. Setting $\hbar=0$ recovers explicit deformation quantizations of a broad class of Poisson vertex algebras, including the classical limits of free-boson, $\beta \gamma$-system, affine, and Virasoro vertex algebras.</p></details>

For every Loewy-graded exact $H$-comodule algebra $A=\oplus_{n\geq 0} A(n)$ and $H_0$-equivariant Morita equivalence $A(0)\simeq_{H_0} X$, there exists a Loewy-graded $H$-comodule algebra $B$ (isomorphic to $X$ in degree zero) realizing an $H$-equivariant Morita equivalence $A\simeq_H B$. In addition, if every exact $H_0$-comodule algebra is $H_0$-equivariant Morita equivalent to a coideal subalgebra of $H_0$, then every Loewy-graded exact $H$-comodule algebra is $H$-equivariant Morita equivalent to a coideal subalgebra of $H$. We also discuss Loewy-graded $H$-comodule algebras with $H_0=\mathcal{KP}$, the Kac-Paljutkin Hopf algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $m$ be a rational integer with $m \neq 0, \pm 1$, and consider the pure number field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{m})$ with $n \ge 3$. Most papers discussing the monogenity of pure number fields focus exclusively on the case where $m$ is square-free. For every integer $n \ge 4$, the monogenity of number fields of degree $n$ is not completely characterized. For example, the monogenity of the pure quartic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{m})$ is not yet fully described, even when $m$ is square-free (see the recent 2024 paper \cite{Nyul} by Arn\'oczki and Nyul). In this paper, based on a classical theorem of Ore concerning prime ideal decomposition in number fields \cite{MN92, O}, we study the monogenity of $K$ without assuming $m$ to be square-free. As an application, we present several examples related to canonical number systems (CNS). In particular, we observe that our results extend some of those presented in \cite{BFC, BF, HNHCNS}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We survey three settings in which dimensions of intersection cohomology groups of algebraic varieties provide deep combinatorial and representation-theoretic information, and computations of the groups themselves have been made using combinatorial sheaves on finite posets. These settings are (1) intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and their realizations via moment graph sheaves and Soergel bimodules; (2) intersection cohomology of toric varieties, the associated g-polynomials of convex polytopes, and their realization via the theory of intersection cohomology of fans; and (3) intersection cohomology of arrangement Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of matroids, and their realization via intersection cohomology of matroids. In all three settings these constructions are valid in more general situations where the variety does not exist, leading to "intersection cohomology without spaces." We give parallel presentations of these three stories, highlighting applications to KLS-polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(G,+)$ be an Abelian group. Given $h\in \mathbb{Z}^+$, a non-empty subset $A$ of $G$ is called an $S_h$-set if all the sums of $h$ distinct elements of $A$ are different. We extend the concept of $S_h$-set to a more general context in the context of finite vectorial spaces over finite fields. More precisely, a $\emptyset \neq A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^r$ is called an $S_h$-linear set if all the linear combinations of $h$ elements of $A$ are different. We establish a correspondence between $q$-ary linear codes and $S_h$-linear sets. This connection allow us to find lower bounds for the maximum size of $S_h$-sets in $\mathbb{F}_q^r$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and motivate -- based on ongoing joint work with Germ\'an Stefanich -- the notion of potent categorical representations of a complex reductive group $G$, specifically a conjectural Langlands correspondence identifying potent categorical representations of $G$ and its Langlands dual $\check G$. We emphasize the symplectic nature of potent categorical representations in their simultaneous dependence on parameters in maximal tori for $G$ and $\check G$, specifically how their conjectural Langlands correspondence fits within a 2-categorical Fourier transform. Our key tool to make various ideas precise is higher sheaf theory and its microlocalization, specifically a theory of ind-coherent sheaves of categories on stacks. The constructions are inspired by the physics of 3d mirror symmetry and S-duality on the one hand, and the theory of double affine Hecke algebras on the other. We also highlight further conjectures related to ongoing programs in and around geometric representation theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The involutory subalgebra K(E$_9$) of the affine Kac-Moody algebra E$_9$ was recently shown to admit an infinite sequence of unfaithful representations of ever increasing dimensions arXiv:2102.00870. We revisit these representations and describe their associated ideals in more detail, with particular emphasis on two chiral versions that can be constructed for each such representation. For every such unfaithful representation we show that the action of K(E$_9$) decomposes into a direct sum of two mutually commuting (`chiral' and `anti-chiral') parabolic algebras with Levi subalgebra $\mathfrak{so}(16)_+\,\oplus\,\mathfrak{so}(16)_-$. We also spell out the consistency conditions for uplifting such representations to unfaithful representations of K(E$_{10}$). From these results it is evident that the holonomy groups so far discussed in the literature are mere shadows (in a Platonic sense) of a much larger structure.</p></details>
