 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gabriel T. Loos &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be an algebraic group over a field $k$, and $M$ and $N$ be $G$-modules. In 1961, Hochschild showed how one can define the cohomology groups $\text{Ext}_{G}^{i}(M,N)$. Kimura, in 1965, showed that one can generalize this to get relative cohomology for algebraic groups. The original cohomology groups play an important role in understanding the representation theory of $G$, but the role of relative cohomology is still not well understood. In this paper the author expands upon the work of Kimura to prove foundational results about the relative cohomology. The author starts by giving the definitions of relative exact sequences and relative injective modules and proves a variety of basic properties for each that will be essential to define relative cohomology and obtain a relative Grothendieck spectral sequence. In particular, the induction functor will play an important role when studying the relative injective modules. Once the necessary ground work is laid, the definition of relative cohomology is given. Finally, it is stated when there is a relative Grothendieck spectral sequence, and many consequences and examples are provided.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Séverin Philip &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Silverberg and Zarhin introduced the notion of a $(p,t,a)$-inertial group in the hope of having a group theoretic characterization of the finite groups that appear as finite monodromy groups -- the groups that represent the local obstruction to semi-stable reduction -- of abelian varieties in fixed dimension $t+a$. In this text, we provide a positive answer to their question, that is, every $(p,t,a)$-inertial group is the finite monodromy group of an abelian variety in dimension $t+a$. To prove this, we show a structure theorem on the rational group algebra $\mathbf{Q}[G]$ of ramification groups, refining a theorem of Serre and generalizing results on $p$-groups of Roquette and Ford.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 7 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use elementary methods to establish three key recurrence relations: one for derangement numbers, a second for harmonic numbers, and a third for degenerate harmonic numbers. Our results not only contribute to the understanding of the underlying structure of these numbers but also highlight the effectiveness of elementary techniques in discovering new mathematical properties. The findings have potential applications in various fields where these numbers appear, including combinatorics, probability, and computer science.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hazem Hassan &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Heegner cycles are higher weight analogues of Heegner points. Their arithmetic intersection numbers also appear as Fourier coefficients of modular forms and often belong to abelian extensions of imaginary-quadratic fields. Rotger and Seveso propose a precise recipe for the $p$-adic Abel-Jacobi images of cycle classes whose existence is predicted by conjectures of Bloch and Beilinson and which would be a real-quadratic analogue to Heegner cycles: the Stark-Heegner cycles of the title. In this paper, we generalize Darmon-Vonk's theory of rigid meromorphic cocycles to higher weight, producing a higher Green's pairing of real-quadratic divisors on the $p$-adic upper half-plane, which seems to be the real-quadratic analogue of the pairing of Heegner cycles. Computation of these values for "principal cycles'' gives evidence that they lie in abelian extensions of real-quadratic fields. The algebraicity of certain values of the higher Green's function is indirect evidence for the existence of algebraic Stark-Heegner cycles.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10364v1'>2509.10364</a>\]&nbsp; **On the semi-infinite cohomology of graded-unitary vertex algebras**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Christopher Beem, Niklas Garner &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 39+2 pages, 1 figure. Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, the first author with A. Ardehali, M. Lemos, and L. Rastelli introduced the notion of graded unitarity for vertex algebras. This generalization of unitarity is motivated by the SCFT/VOA correspondence and introduces a novel Hilbert space structure on the state space of a large class of vertex algebras that are not unitary in the conventional sense. In this paper, we study the relative semi-infinite cohomology of graded-unitary vertex algebras that admit a chiral quantum moment map for an affine current algebra at twice the critical level. We show that the relative semi-infinite chain complex for such a graded-unitary vertex algebra has a structure analogous to that of differential forms on a compact K\"ahler manifold, generalizing a strong form of the classic construction of Banks--Peskin and Frenkel--Garland--Zuckerman. We deduce that the relative semi-infinite cohomology is itself graded-unitary, which establishes graded unitarity for a large class of vertex operator algebras arising from three- and four-dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theories. We further establish an outer USp$(2)$ action on the semi-infinite cohomology (which does not respect cohomological grading), analogous to the Lefschetz $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ in K\"ahler geometry. We also show that the semi-infinite chain complex is quasi-isomorphic as a differential graded vertex algebra to its cohomology, in analogy to the formality result of Deligne--Griffiths--Morgan--Sullivan for the de Rham cohomology of compact K\"ahler manifolds. We conclude by observing consequences of these results to the associated Poisson vertex algebras and related finite-type derived Poisson reductions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we prove the integrality conjecture for quotient stacks arising from weakly symmetric representations of reductive groups. Our main result is a decomposition of the cohomology of the stack into finite-dimensional components indexed by some equivalence classes of cocharacters of a maximal torus. This decomposition enables the definition of new enumerative invariants associated with the stack, which we begin to explore.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Elementary Type Conjecture in Galois theory provides a concrete inductive description of the finitely generated maximal pro-$p$ Galois groups $G_F(p)$ of fields $F$ containing a root of unity of order $p$. We describe several variants of this conjecture, and prove various connections between these variants and other conjectures in field and Galois theory. We focus on a strong arithmetical variant of the conjecture, and its implications to the realization of pro-$p$ Demuskin groups as Galois groups.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Benjamin Dequêne, Michaël Schoonheere &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is the second part of a series that intends to study the resolving subcategories for gentle algebras over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{K}$. As in the first part, we continue to focus on gentle quivers $(Q,R)$, where $Q$ is a directed tree, known as gentle trees. In our previous work, via a modified surface model for gentle algebras with finite global dimension, we studied the join-irreducible elements of the lattice of resolving subcategories of $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R \rangle - \text{mod}$, which happen to be those generated by a non-projective indecomposable object. In this paper, we notice that this lattice is not semidistributive in general and, accordingly, introduce a so-called upper join-decomposition, replacing the canonical one. Together with the techniques we develop in our geometric model, it allows us to describe the resolving subcategories of any gentle tree. These same techniques let us explicitly construct the resolving subcategory generated by any collection of indecomposable $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R\rangle$-modules.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 19 pages, minor corrections

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose an explicit construction of a weighted generalised Grassmannian. For a weighted Grassmannian (i.e., for series A) we obtain an effective parametrisation of possible $\mathbb{Z}$-gradings on Pl\"{u}cker coordinates, and provide the explicit formulae for its dualising sheaf and Hilbert series in terms of this parametrisation. Our approach can be generalised to other irreducible root systems.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Christian Ikenmeyer, Heidi Omar, Dimitrios Tsintsilidas &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 11 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct an explicit field-independent SL$_2$-equivariant isomorphism between an invariant space of tensors and a plethysm space. The existence of such an isomorphism was only known in characteristic 0, and only indirectly via character theory. Our isomorphism naturally extends the web of field-independent isomorphisms given by Hermite reciprocity, Hodge duality, and the Wronskian isomorphism. This is a characteristic free generalization of a classical situation in characteristic zero: certain rectangular Kronecker coefficients coincide with certain plethysm coefficients, and their non-negativiy proves the unimodality of the $q$-binomial coefficient. We also give a short combinatorial field-independent proof that the Hermite reciprocity map over the standard basis is a triangular matrix with 1s on the main diagonal.</p></details>

> **Comment:** in French language

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let G be a connected reductive group defined over a non-archimedean local field of characteristic 0. We assume G is quasi-split, adjoint and absolutly simple. Let g be the Lie algebra of G. We consider the space of the invariant distributions on g(F), which are stable and supported by the set of nilpotent elements of g(F). Magdy Assem has stated several conjectures which describe this space. We prove some of these conjectures, assuming that the residual characteristic of F is ''very large'' relatively to G.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sandro Bettin, Loïc Grenié, Giuseppe Molteni, Carlo Sanna &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An Egyptian fraction is a sum of the form $1/n_1 + \cdots + 1/n_r$ where $n_1, \dots, n_k$ are distinct positive integers. We prove explicit lower bounds for the cardinality of the set $E_N$ of rational numbers that can be represented by Egyptian fractions with denominators not exceeding $N$. More precisely, we show that for every integer $k \geq 4$ such that $\ln_k N \geq 3/2$ it holds $$ \frac{\ln(|E_N|)}{\ln 2} \geq \Big(2 - \frac{3}{\ln_k N}\Big)\frac{N}{\ln N}\prod_{j=3}^{k} \ln_j N , $$ where $\ln_k$ denotes the $k$-th iterate of the natural logarithm. This improves on a previous result of Bleicher and Erd\H{o}s who established a similar bound but under the more stringent condition $\ln_k N\geq k$ and with a leading constant of $1$. Furthermore, we provide some methods to compute the exact values of $|E_N|$ for large positive integers $N$, and we give a table of $|E_N|$ for $N$ up to $154$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Shuming Liu, Bing He &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the probability that some weighted partial sums of a random multiplicative function $f$ are positive. Applying the characteristic decomposition, we obtain that if $S$ is a non-empty subset of the multiplicative residue class group $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ with $m$ being a fixed positive integer and $A=\{a+mn\mid n=0,1,2,3,\cdots\}$ with $a\in S,$ then there exists a positive number $\delta$ independent of $x$, such that $$ \mathbb{P}\left(\sum_{A\cap[1,x)}\frac{f(n)}{n}<0\right)>\delta $$ unless the coefficients of the real characters in the expansion of the characteristic function of $S$ according to the characters of $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ are all non-negative, and the coefficients of the complex characters are all zero, in which case we have $$ \mathbb{P}\left(\sum_{A\cap[1,x)}\frac{f(n)}{n}<0\right)=O\left(\exp\left(-\exp\left(\frac{\ln x}{C\ln_{2}x}\right)\right)\right) $$ for a positive constant $C.$ This includes as a special case a result of Angelo and Xu. We also extend the result to the cyclotomic field $K_{n}=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{n})$ with $\zeta_{n}=e^{2\pi i/n}$ and study the probability that these generalized weighted sums are positive. In addition, we deal with the positivity problem of certain partial sums related to the celebrated Ramanujan tau function $\tau(n)$ and the Ramanujan modular form $\Delta(q),$ and obtain an upper bound for the probability that these partial sums are negative in a more general situation.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Schlosser and Zhou proposed many conjectures on sign patterns of the coefficients appearing in the $q$-series expansions of the infinite Borwein product and other infinite products raised to a real power. In this paper, we will study several of these conjectures. Let $$ G(q):=\prod_{i=1}^{I}\left(\prod_{k=0}^{\infty}(1-q^{m_{i}+kn_{i}})(1-q^{-m_{i}+(k+1)n_{i}})\right)^{u_{i}} $$ where $I$ is a positive integer, $1\leq m_{i}<n_{i}$ and $u_{i}\neq0$ for $1\leq i\leq I$ and $|q|<1.$ We will establish an asymptotic formula for the coefficients of $G(q)^{\delta}$ with $\delta$ being a positive real number by using the Hardy--Ramanujan--Rademacher circle method. As applications, we apply the asymptotic formula to confirm some of the conjectures of Schlosser and Zhou.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The adjunction between coalgebras and Hopf algebras, first described by Takeuchi, allows one to prove that the semi-abelian category of cocommutative Hopf algebras has enough $\mathcal E$-projective objects with respect to the class $\mathcal{E}$ of cleft extensions. One then proves that, for any cocommutative Hopf algebra, there exists a weak $\mathcal{E}$-universal normal (=central) extension. This fact allows one to apply the methods of categorical Galois theory to classify normal $\mathcal{E}$-extensions and to provide an explicit description of the fundamental group of a cocommutative Hopf algebra in terms of a generalized Hopf formula. Moreover, with any cleft extension, we associate a 5-term exact sequence in homology that can be seen as a Hopf-theoretic analogue of the classical Stallings-Stammbach exact sequence in group theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is motivated by the following problem. Define a quantum walk on a positively weighted path (linear chain). Can the weights be tuned so that perfect state transfer occurs between the first vertex and any other position? We do not fully answer this question - in fact, we show that a particular case of this problem is equivalent to a solution of a particular case of the well known Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem, deeming our original task certainly harder than anticipated. In our journey, we prove new results about sequences of orthogonal polynomials satisfying three-term recurrences. In particular, we provide a full characterization of when two polynomials belong to such a sequence, which (as far as we were able to ascertain) was known only for when their degrees differ by one.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper focuses on the fractal characteristics of the absolutely continuous spectral measure of the subcritical almost Mathieu operator (AMO) and Diophantine frequency. In particular, we give a complete description of the (classical) multifractal spectrum and a finer description in the logarithmic gauge. The proof combines continued$-$fraction$/$metric Diophantine techniques and refined covering arguments. These results rigorously substantiate (and quantify in a refined gauge) the physicists' intuition that the absolutely continuous component of the spectrum is dominated by energies with trivial scaling index, while also exhibiting nontrivial exceptional sets which are negligible for classical Hausdorff measure but large at the logarithmic scale.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\chi$ be a Dirichlet character mod $D$ with $L(s,\chi)$ its associated $L$-function, and let $\psi(x,q,a)$ be Chebyshev's prime-counting function for primes congruent to $a$ modulo $q$. We show that under the assumption of an exceptional character $\chi$ with $L(1,\chi)=o\left((\log D)^{-5}\right)$, for any $q<x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$, the asymptotic $$\psi(x,q,a)=\frac{\psi(x)}{\phi(q)}\left(1-\chi\left(\frac{aD}{(D,q)}\right)+o(1)\right)$$ holds for almost all $a$ with $(a,q)=1$. We also find that for any fixed $a$, the above holds for almost all $q<x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$ with $(a,q)=1$. Previous prime equidistribution results under the assumption of Siegel zeroes (by Friedlander-Iwaniec and the current author) have found that the above asymptotic holds either for all $a$ and $q$ or on average over a range of $q$ (i.e. for the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture), but only under the assumption that $q<x^{\theta}$ where $\theta=\frac{30}{59}$ or $\frac{16}{31}$, respectively.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages, 8 figures; graph-theoretic methods applied to problems in number theory

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite subset $A$ of a group $G$, we define the right quotient set and the left quotient set of $A$, respectively, as $AA^{-1} := \{a_1a_2^{-1}:a_1,a_2\in A\}$, $A^{-1}A := \{a_1^{-1}a_2:a_1,a_2\in A\}$. While the right and left quotient sets are equal if $G$ is abelian, subtleties arise when $G$ is a nonabelian group, where the cardinality difference $|AA^{-1}| - |A^{-1}A|$ may be take on arbitrarily large values. Using the results of Martin and O'Bryant on the cardinality differences of sum sets and difference sets in $\mathbb{Z}$, we prove in the infinite dihedral group, $D_\infty \cong \mathbb{Z} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, every integer difference is achievable. Further, we prove that in $F_2$, the free group on $2$ generators, an integer difference is achievable if and only if that integer is even, and we explicitly construct subsets of $F_2$ that achieve every even integer. We further determine the minimum cardinality of $A \subset G$ so that the difference between the cardinalities of the left and right quotient sets is nonzero, depending on the existence of order $2$ elements in $G$. To prove these results, we construct difference graphs $D_A$ and $D_{A^{-1}}$ which encode equality, respectively, in the right and left quotient sets. We observe a bijection from edges in $D_A$ to edges in $D_{A^{-1}}$ and count connected components in order to obtain our results on cardinality differences $|AA^{-1}| - |A^{-1}A|$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a rigorous proof of the Gang-Yonekura formula describing the transformation of the 3D index under Dehn filling a cusp in an orientable 3-manifold. The 3D index, originally introduced by Dimofte, Gaiotto and Gukov, is a physically inspired q-series that encodes deep topological and geometric information about cusped 3-manifolds. Building on the interpretation of the 3D index as a generating function over Q-normal surfaces, we introduce a relative version of the index for ideal triangulations with exposed boundary. This notion allows us to formulate a relative Gang-Yonekura formula, which we prove by developing a gluing principle for relative indices and establishing an inductive framework in the case of layered solid tori. Our approach makes use of Garoufalidis-Kashaev's meromorphic extension of the index, along with new identities involving q-hypergeometric functions. As an application, we study the limiting behaviour of the index for large fillings. We also develop code to perform certified computations of the index, guaranteeing correctness up to a specified accuracy. Our extensive computations support the topological invariance of the 3D index and suggest a well-defined extension to closed manifolds.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Hickman and Wright proved an $L^2$ restriction estimate for the parabola $\Sigma$ in $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ of the form $$\left(\frac{1}{|\Sigma|}\sum\limits_{m\in\Sigma}|\widehat{f}(m)|^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq C_\epsilon N^\epsilon\cdot N^{-1}\left(\sum\limits_{x\in (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2}|f(x)|^\frac{6}{5}\right)^\frac{5}{6}$$ for all functions $f:(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ and any $\epsilon>0$, and that this bound is sharp when $N$ has a large square factor, and especially for $N = p^2$ for $p$ a prime. In contrast, Mockenhaupt and Tao proved in the special case $N = p$ the stronger estimate $$\left(\frac{1}{|\Sigma|}\sum\limits_{m\in\Sigma}|\widehat{f}(m)|^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq C N^{-1}\left(\sum\limits_{x\in (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2}|f(x)|^\frac{4}{3}\right)^\frac{3}{4}.$$ We extend the Mockenhaupt-Tao bound to the case of squarefree $N$, proving $$\left(\frac{1}{|\Sigma|}\sum\limits_{m\in\Sigma}|\widehat{f}(m)|^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq C_\epsilon N^\epsilon\cdot N^{-1}\left(\sum\limits_{x\in (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2}|f(x)|^\frac{4}{3}\right)^\frac{3}{4},$$ and discuss applications of this result to uncertainty principles and signal recovery.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is well-known that an averaging operator on a commutative associative algebra gives rise to a perm algebra. This paper lifts this process to the level of bialgebras. For this purpose, we first give an infinitesimal bialgebra structure for averaging commutative associative algebras and characterize it by double constructions of averaging Frobenius commutative algebras. To find the bialgebra counterpart of perm algebras that is induced by such averaging bialgebras, we need a new two-part splitting of the multiplication in a perm algebra, which differs from the usual splitting of the perm algebra (into the pre-perm algebra) by the characterized representation. This gives rise to the notion of an averaging-pre-perm algebra, or simply an apre-perm algebra. Furthermore, the notion of special apre-perm algebras which are apre-perm algebras with the second multiplications being commutative is introduced as the underlying algebra structure of perm algebras with nondegenerate symmetric left-invariant bilinear forms. The latter are also the induced structures of symmetric Frobenius commutative algebras with averaging operators. Consequently, a double construction of averaging Frobenius commutative algebra gives rise to a Manin triple of special apre-perm algebras. In terms of bialgebra structures, this means that an averaging commutative and cocommutative infinitesimal bialgebra gives rise to a special apre-perm bialgebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1988, Andrews, Dyson, and Hickerson showed that a $q$-series $\sigma$ found in Ramanujan's lost notebook and related to partitions could be interpreted as counting ideals in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})$, and found similar formulas for $\sigma$ in terms of ideals of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$. Cohen followed this by showing more generally that for certain triples of quadratic fields, there is abelian extension and conductor so that the ray class character theta series for all three fields coincide. In the intervening years, several $q$-series counting ideals in quadratic fields have been explored, nearly all relating to the fields explored by Andrews et al. In this paper we give an example of a ray class character theta series which stems from $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-6})$, $\mathbb{Q}(i)$, and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})$. We use recent work of Okano to give explicit formulas via quadratic form theta series with congruence conditions stemming from each field. We isolate an analogue of $\sigma$ for this series and show that it has coefficients also given by a partition generating function.</p></details>

Maity, explicit descriptions of the second and first real de Rham cohomology groups of a general homogeneous space of a Lie group are given, extending an earlier result in "On the exactness of Kostant-Kirillov form and the second cohomology of nilpotent orbits, Internat. J. Math. 23 (2012), no. 8, 1250086" by I. Biswas and P. Chatterjee. From the computational viewpoint, they turned out to be new and very useful, and in fact played a crucial role in determining the second cohomology of nilpotent orbits as done in the above two papers. In this paper, we give computable and explicit descriptions of the third and fourth real de Rham cohomologies of a general homogeneous space, in terms of the associated Lie-theoretic data, along the lines mentioned above. We also draw numerous corollaries of our main results in important special settings. Moreover, as a consequence, we obtain a new and interesting invariant by showing that for a large class of homogeneous spaces, the difference between the third and fourth Betti numbers coincides with the difference between the numbers of simple factors of the ambient group and the associated closed subgroup.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 68 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is the first paper in a series on intrinsic Donaldson-Thomas theory, where we develop a new framework for enumerative geometry that allows the generalization of constructions and results from linear moduli stacks to general non-linear algebraic stacks. In this paper, we introduce the component lattice of an algebraic stack. This is a key object in our theory, defined using the formalism of stacks of graded and filtered points. It provides the combinatorial data needed to formulate various results in enumerative geometry, such as decomposition-type theorems and wall-crossing formulae. Later papers in the series will focus on extending Donaldson-Thomas theory to the non-linear case, and we expect that our approach will be useful for extending many other flavours of enumerative invariants beyond the linear case as well. This paper proves several foundational results of our framework. The first is the constancy theorem, which states that the isomorphism types of connected components of the stacks of graded and filtered points stay constant within chambers in the component lattice. The second is the finiteness theorem, which provides a criterion for the finiteness of the number of possible isomorphism types of these components. The third is the associativity theorem, generalizing the structure of Hall algebras from linear stacks to general stacks. We also discuss some applications of these results outside Donaldson-Thomas theory, including a construction of stacks of real-weighted filtrations, and a generalization of the semistable reduction theorem to real-weighted filtrations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The parity of the partition function $p(n)$ remains strikingly mysterious. Beyond a handful of fragmentary results, essentially nothing is known about the distribution of parity. We prove a uniform result on quadratic progressions. If $1<D\equiv 23\pmod{24}$ is square-free and only divisible by primes $\ell\equiv 1, 7\pmod 8$, then both parities occur infinitely often among $$ p\left(\frac{Dm^2+1}{24}\right), $$ with $(m,6)=1.$ The argument takes place on the modular curve $X_0(6)$ and shows that parity along these thin orbits is \emph{not constant}. The proof connects classical identities for the partition generating function, through the method of (twisted) Borcherds products, to the arithmetic geometry of {\it ordinary} CM fibers on the Deligne-Rapoport model of $X_0(6)$ in characteristic 2. This result is a special case of a general theorem for the coefficients of suitable vector-valued weight 1/2 harmonic Maass forms that satisfy a "Heegner packet'' condition.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish the limiting distribution of $\frac{{(\log \log x)}^{1/4}}{\sqrt{x}} \sum_{n\le x}\alpha(n)$ where $\alpha$ is a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, answering a question of Harper. The distributional convergence is proved by applying the martingale central limit theorem to a suitably truncated sum. This truncation is inspired by work of Najnudel, Paquette, Simm and Vu on subcritical holomorphic multiplicative chaos setting, but analysed with a different conditioning argument generalised from Harper's work on fractional moments to circumvent integrability issues at criticality. A significant part of the proof is devoted to the convergence in probability of the associated partial Euler product to a critical multiplicative chaos measure, independent of the mild shift away from the critical line. Our approach to the universality of critical non-Gaussian multiplicative chaos bypasses the barrier analysis with the help of a modified second moment method, and employs a novel argument based on coupling and homogenisation by change of measure, which could be of independent interest.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix $n\ge3$. For the pure field $K_a=\Bbb Q(\theta)$, $\theta^n=a$ with $a$ $n$th-power-free, we encode an integral basis in the fixed coordinate $\{1,\theta,\dots,\theta^{n-1}\}$ by its \emph{shape}. We prove a sharp local-to-global principle: for each $p^e\!\parallel n$, the local shape at $p$ is determined by $a\bmod p^{\,e+1}$, and this precision is optimal. Moreover, the global shape is periodic with minimal modulus $$ M(n)=\prod_{p^e\parallel n}p^{\,e+1}=n\cdot\mathrm{rad}(n), $$ providing many applications in the understanding integral bases of pure number fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the field of characteristic two, $\mathbb F_2.$ Denote by $GL(q)$ the general linear group of rank $q$ over $\mathbb F_2.$ The algebraic transfer, introduced by W. Singer [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523], is a rather effective tool for unraveling the intricate structure of the (mod-2) cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr A}^{q,*}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2).$ The Kameko homomorphism is one of the useful tools to study the dimension of the domain of the Singer transfer. Singer conjectured that the algebraic transfer is always a monomorphism, but this remains open for all homology degrees $q\geq 5.$ In this paper, by constructing a novel algorithm implemented in the computer algebra system OSCAR for computing $GL(q)$-invariants of the kernel of the Kameko homomorphism, we disprove Singer's conjecture for bidegree $(6, 6+36).$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\alpha$ be a Steinhaus random multiplicative function. For a wide class of multiplicative functions $f$ we construct a multiplicative chaos measure arising from the Dirichlet series of $\alpha f$, in the whole $L^1$-regime. Our method does not rely on the thick point approach or Gaussian approximation, and uses a modified second moment method with the help of an approximate Girsanov theorem. We also employ the idea of weak convergence in $L^r$ to show that the limiting measure is independent of the choice of the approximation schemes, and this may be seen as a non-Gaussian analogue of Shamov's characterisation of multiplicative chaos. Our class of $f$-s consists of those for which the mean value of $|f(p)|^2$ lies in $(0,1)$. In particular, it includes the indicator of sums of two squares. As an application of our construction, we establish a generalised central limit theorem for the (normalised) sums of $\alpha f$, with random variance determined by the total mass of our measure.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 35 pages, part II of a series of 4 articles, minor corrections to v1

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This series of papers is a contribution to the program of classifying $p$-blocks of finite groups up to source algebra equivalence, starting with the case of cyclic blocks. To any $p$-block $\mathbf{B}$ of a finite group with cyclic defect group $D$, Linckelmann associated an invariant $W( \mathbf{B} )$, which is an indecomposable endo-permutation module over $D$, and which, together with the Brauer tree of $\mathbf{B}$, essentially determines its source algebra equivalence class. In Parts II-IV of our series of papers, we classify, for odd $p$, those endo-permutation modules of cyclic $p$-groups arising from $p$-blocks of quasisimple groups. In the present Part II, we reduce the desired classification for the quasisimple classical groups of Lie type $B$, $C$, and $D$ to the corresponding objective for the general linear and unitary groups; the classification is completed for the latter groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Abel's problem consists in identifying the conditions under which the diferential equation $y'=\eta y$, with $\eta$ an algebraic function in $\mathbb{C}(x)$, possesses a non-zero algebraic solution $y$. This problem has been algorithmically solved by Risch. In a previous paper, we have presented an alternative solution in the special arithmetic situation where $\eta$ has a Puiseux expansion with $\textit{rational}$ coefficients at the origin: there exists a non-trivial algebraic solution of $y'=\eta y$ if and only if the coefficients of the Puiseux expansion of $x\eta(x)$ at $0$ satisfy Gauss congruences for almost all prime numbers. In this paper, we generalize this criterion to arbitrary $\eta$ algebraic over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}(x)$, by means of a natural generalization to number fields of Gauss congruences and of the weaker Cartier congruences recently introduced in this context by Bostan. We then provide applications of this criterion in the hypergeometric setting and for Artin-Mazur zeta functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We systematically apply semisimplification functors in modular representation theory. Motivated by the Duflo--Serganova functor in Lie superalgebras, we construct various functors of interest. In the setting of finite groups, we refine the cyclic group Brauer construction and categorify the Glauberman correspondence. In the setting of degenerate categorical Heisenberg actions, we obtain a rich collection of functors which commute with the categorical action. Applied to well-known categorifications of the basic representation and Fock space, our functors give explicit realizations of periodic equivalences for polynomial functors and symmetric groups first studied by Henke-Koenig. This allows us to globalize the equivalences of Henke-Koenig by symmetric monoidal functors. We apply these results to deduce branching properties of certain modular representations of $S_n$.</p></details>

We use this object to characterize probability distributions over integer partitions satisfying a law of large numbers and those that satisfy a central limit theorem. We further establish a multilevel central limit theorem, which enables the study of random standard Young tableaux. As applications of these results, we describe the fluctuations of height functions associated with (i) the Plancherel growth process, (ii) random standard Young tableaux of fixed shape, and (iii) probability distributions induced by extreme characters of the infinite symmetric group $S_\infty$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Our goal in this paper is to construct optimal topological generators for compact unitary Lie groups, extending the work of a letter of Sarnak and arXiv:1704.02106 on golden and super-golden gates to higher dimensions. To do so we consider a variant of the Sarnak--Xue Density Hypotheses in the weight aspect for definite projective unitary groups and prove it using the endoscopic classification of automorphic representations. Our main motivation is to construct efficient multi-qubit universal gate sets for quantum computers. For example, we find a set of universal gates that, for a given accuracy, can heuristically approximate arbitrary unitary operations on 2 qubits with $\approx$10 times fewer ``expensive'' $T$-type gates than the standard Clifford+$T$ set. Our framework also covers the 2-qubit Clifford+CS gate set, well-known for being particularly friendly to fault-tolerant implementation. We thereby prove tight upper bounds on the required CS count for approximations (specifically, $4.8$x fewer non-Clifford gates than Clifford+$T$).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The representation theory of tensor functions is essential to constitutive modeling of materials including both mechanical and physical behaviors. Generally, material symmetry is incorporated in the tensor functions through a structural or anisotropic tensor that characterizes the corresponding point group. The general mathematical framework was well-established in the 1990s. Nevertheless, the traditional theory suffers from a grand challenge that many point groups involve fourth or sixth order structural tensors that hinder its practical applications in engineering. Recently, researchers have reformulated the representation theory and opened up opportunities to model anisotropic materials using low-order (i.e., 2nd-order and lower) structural tensors only, although the theory was not fully established. This work aims to fully establish the reformulated representation theory of tensor functions for all two-dimensional point groups. It was found that each point group needs a structural tensor set to characterize the symmetry. For each two-dimensional point group, the structural tensor set is proposed and the general tensor functions are derived. Only low-order structural tensors are introduced so researchers can readily apply these tensor functions for their modeling applications. The theory presented here is useful for constitutive modeling of materials in general, especially for composites, nanomaterials, soft tissues, etc.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the homological properties of Schur algebras $S(p, 2p)$ over a field $k$ of positive characteristic $p$, focusing on their interplay with the representation theory of quotients of group algebras of symmetric groups via Schur-Weyl duality. Schur-Weyl duality establishes that the centraliser algebra, $\Lambda(p, 2p)$, of the tensor space $(k^p)^{\otimes 2p}$ (as a module over $S(p, 2p)$) is a quotient of the group algebra of the symmetric group. In this paper, we prove that Schur-Weyl duality between $S(p, 2p)$ and $\Lambda(p, 2p)$ is an instance of an Auslander-type correspondence. We compute the global dimension of Schur algebras $S(p, 2p)$ and their relative dominant dimension with respect to the tensor space $(k^p)^{\otimes 2p}$. In particular, we show that the pair $(S(p, 2p), (k^p)^{\otimes 2p})$ forms a relative $4(p-1)$-Auslander pair in the sense of Cruz and Psaroudakis, thereby connecting Schur algebras with higher homological algebra. Moreover, we determine the Hemmer-Nakano dimension associated with the quasi-hereditary cover of $\Lambda(p, 2p)$ that arises from Schur-Weyl duality. As an application, we show that the direct sum of some Young modules over $\Lambda(p, 2p)$ is a full tilting module when $p>2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It has been known since 1992 that the McKay-Thompson series $T_g(q)$ of the Moonshine module form Hauptmoduln for genus zero subgroups of $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$. In 2021, Lin and Shao constructed a series analogous to the McKay-Thompson series (a twined partition function of the Monster CFT), but using a non-invertible topological defect rather than an element of the Monster group $\mathcal{M}$. This "defect McKay-Thompson series" was found to be invariant under a genus zero subgroup of $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$, but was shown not to be the Hauptmodul of the subgroup. Nevertheless, one might wonder if a weaker version of Borcherds' theorem holds for non-invertible defects: perhaps defect McKay-Thompson series enjoy genus zero invariance groups in $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$, whether or not they are Hauptmoduln for those groups. Using the decompositions of the monster stress tensor found in Bae et al. (2021), we construct several new defect McKay-Thompson series, study their modular properties, and determine their invariance groups in $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$. We discover that many of the invariance groups are not genus zero.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We identify a close relationship between stable sheaf cohomology for polynomial functors applied to the cotangent bundle on projective space, and Koszul--Ringel duality on the category of strict polynomial functors as described in the work of Cha\l upnik, Krause, and Touz\'e. Combining this with recent results of Maliakas--Stergiopoulou we confirm a conjectured periodicity statement for stable cohomology. In a different direction, we find a remarkable invariance property for $\Ext$ groups between Schur functors associated to hook partitions, and compute all such extension groups over a field of arbitrary characteristic. We show that this is further equivalent to the calculation of $\Ext$ groups for partitions with $2$ rows (or $2$ columns), and as such it relates to Parker's recursive description of $\Ext$ groups for $\SL_2$-representations. Finally, we give a general sharp bound for the interval of degrees where stable cohomology of a Schur functor can be non-zero.</p></details>

The quotient $P_n(q) = C_n(q)/(q-1)^2$ is a palindromic polynomial of degree $2n-2$. For each $n\geq 1$ let ${\overline{P}}_n(X) \in {\mathbb{Z}}[X]$ be the degree $n-1$ polynomial such that ${\overline{P}}_n(q+q^{-1}) = P_n(q)/q^{n-1}$. In this note we show that for any integer $N$ the integer value ${\overline{P}}_n(N)$ is close to the value at $N$ of the degree $n-1$ polynomial $F_{n-1}(X) = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \, {\overline{T}}_k(X)$, which is a sum of monic versions ${\overline{T}}_k(X)$ of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. We give a precise formula for ${\overline{P}}_n(X)$ as a linear combination of $F_k(X)$'s, each appearance of the latter being parametrized by an odd divisor of $n$. As a consequence, ${\overline{P}}_n(X) = F_{n-1}(X)$ if and only if $n$ is a power of $2$. We exhibit similar formulas for $C_n(q)$.</p></details>

The crucial case of elliptic curves already follows from a result by Corvaja, Demeio, Masser and Zannier: in this case we provide an alternative proof using the Pila-Zannier method.

Aizenbud, D. Gourevitch and S. Sahi. Furthermore, we prove the vanishing of higher extension groups for arbitrary pairs of generic representations, confirming a conjecture of Dipendra Prasad. We also utilize the Bernstein-Zelevinsky theory to establish two additional results: the Leibniz law for the highest derivative and a unitarity criterion for general linear groups. Lastly, we apply the Bernstein-Zelevinsky theory to prove the Hausdorffness and exactness of the twisted homology of split even orthogonal groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Schanuel Conjecture contains all ``reasonable" statements that can be made on the values of the exponential function. In particular it implies the Lindemann-Weierstrass Theorem. In my Ph.D. I showed that Schanuel Conjecture has a geometrical origin: it is equivalent to the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture applied to a 1-motive without abelian part. In this paper, we state a conjecture in Schanuel style, which will imply conjectures in Lindemann-Weierstrass style, for the semi-elliptic exponential function, that is for the exponential map of an extension G of an elliptic curve E by a multiplicative group. We propose the semi-elliptic Conjecture, which concerns the exponential function, the Weierstrass $\wp,$ $\zeta$ functions and Serre functions. The case of a trivial extension has been treated in \cite{BW}, where we introduced the split semi-elliptic Conjecture. As in Schanuel's case, we expect that the semi-elliptic Conjecture contains all ``reasonable" statements that can be made on the values of the exponential function, of the Weierstrass $\wp$, $\zeta$ functions and of Serre functions. We show that the semi-elliptic Conjecture has a geometrical origin (as Schanuel Conjecture): it is equivalent to the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture applied to a 1-motive whose underlying abelian part is an elliptic curve. We prove the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture for 1-motives defined by an elliptic curve with algebraic invariants and complex multiplication and by torsion points. We introduce the $\sigma$-Conjecture which involves the Weierstrass $\wp$, $\zeta$ and $\sigma$ functions and we show that this conjecture is a consequence of the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture applied to an adequate 1-motive.</p></details>

Gan-Savin ($p \neq 2$) and Takeda-Wood ($p=2$) obtained an equivalence between the Bernstein block of $\mathrm{Mp}(2n)$ containing the even (resp. odd) Weil representation and the Iwahori-spherical block of the split $\mathrm{SO}(2n+1)$ (resp. its non-split inner form), by giving an isomorphism between Hecke algebras. We revisit this equivalence from an endoscopic perspective.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Two abelian varieties $A$ and $B$ over a number field $K$ are said to be strongly locally quadratic twists if they are quadratic twists at every completion of $K$. While it was known that this does not imply that $A$ and $B$ are quadratic twists over $K$, the only known counterexamples (necessarily of dimension $\geq 4$) are not geometrically simple. We show that, for every prime $p\equiv 13 \pmod{24}$, there exists a pair of geometrically simple abelian varieties of dimension $p-1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ that are strongly locally quadratic twists but not quadratic twists. The proof is based on Galois cohomology computations and class field theory.</p></details>

Then, we present deterministic polynomial time algorithms to perform the orthogonalization process, solve the LVP and solve the CVP with an orthogonal basis of the whole vector space. Finally, we conclude that orthogonalization and the CVP are polynomially equivalent.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a rigid object $M$ in an algebraic triangulated category $\mathcal{T}$, a functor pr$(M)\to\mathcal{H}^{[-1,0]}({\rm proj}\, A)$ is constructed, which essentially takes an object to its `presentation', where pr$(M)$ is the full subcategory of $\mathcal{T}$ of objects finitely presented by $M$, $A$ is the endomorphism algebra of $M$ and $\mathcal{H}^{[-1,0]}({\rm proj}\, A)$ is the homotopy category of complexes of finitely projective $A$-modules concentrated in degrees $-1$ and $0$. This functor is shown to be full and dense and its kernel is described. It detects isomorphisms, indecomposability and extriangles. In the Hom-finite case, it induces a bijection from the set of isomorphism classes of basic relative cluster-tilting objects of pr$(M)$ to that of basic silting complexs of $\mathcal{H}^{[-1,0]}({\rm proj}\, A)$, which commutes with mutations. These results are applied to cluster categories of self-injective quivers with potential to recover a theorem of Mizuno on the endomorphism algebras of certain 2-term silting complexes. As an interesting consequence of the main results, if $\mathcal{T}$ is a 2-Calabi--Yau triangulated category and $M$ is a cluster-tilting object such that $A$ is self-injective, then $\mathbb{P}$ is an equivalence, in particular, $\mathcal{H}^{[-1,0]}({\rm proj}\, A)$ admits a triangle structure. In the appendix by Iyama it is shown that for a finite-dimensional algebra $A$, if $\mathcal{H}^{[-1,0]}({\rm proj}\, A)$ admits a triangle structure, then $A$ is necessarily self-injective.</p></details>

Coates-Sujatha observed that the structure of the fine Selmer group of $E$ over a $p$-adic Lie extension of a number field is intricately related to some deep questions in classical Iwasawa theory; for example, Iwasawa's classical $\mu$-invariant vanishing conjecture. In this article, we study the properties of the $p^\infty$-fine Selmer group of an elliptic curve over certain $p$-adic Lie extensions of a number field. We also define and discuss $p^\infty$-fine Selmer group of an elliptic curve over function fields of characteristic $p$ and also of characteristic $\ell \neq p.$ We relate our study with a conjecture of Jannsen.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Two pertinent questions for any support theory of a monoidal triangulated category are whether it is functorial and if the tensor product property holds. To this end, we consider the complete prime spectrum of an essentially small monoidal triangulated category, which we show is universal among support data satisfying the tensor product property, even if it is empty. The complete prime spectrum is functorial and parametrizes radical thick tensor-ideals, a noncommutative analogue of Balmer's reconstruction theorem. We give criteria for when induced maps on complete prime spectra are injective or surjective, and determine the complete prime spectrum for crossed product categories. Finally, we determine the universal functorial support theory for monoidal triangulated categories coinciding with the Balmer spectrum on braided monoidal triangulated categories.</p></details>

Then we study the Berezin correspondence and the complex Weyl correspondence in connection with a generic representation $\pi$ of $G$, proving in particular that these correspondences are covariant with respect to $\pi$. We give also some explicit formulas for the Berezin symbols and the complex Weyl symbols of the representation operators $\pi(g)$ for $g\in G$. These results are applied to recover various formulas involving the Moyal product. Moreover, we relate $\pi$ to a coadjoint orbit of $G$ in the spirit of the Kirillov-Kostant method of orbits. This allows us to establish that the complex Weyl correspondence is a Stratonovich-Weyl correspondence for $\pi$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using the \texttt{WeylModules} \textsf{GAP} Package, we compute structural information about certain Weyl modules for type $G_2$ in characteristic $2$. This gives counterexamples to two conjectures stated by S.~Donkin in 1990. It also illustrates capabilities of the package, which can in principle be applied to Weyl modules for any simple, simply-connected algebraic group in any characteristic, subject of course to time and space limitations of computational resources.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a modified version of the necklace Lie bialgebra associated to a quiver, in which the bracket and cobracket insert (rather than remove) pairs of arrows in involution. This structure is then related to canonical quartic Poisson/Batalin-Vilkovisky structures on suitable representation varieties of the quiver. Constructions on the representation side take place in symmetric monoidal $\Pi$-categories, which prompts a discussion of graded differential operators on commutative monoids in any such category. The generality of the categorical approach allows us to fully recover necklace structures, showing how the modified and classical necklace operations are related via dualisability.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The rank two Jacobi algebra $\mathcal{J}_2$ is used to provide an interpretation of the two-variable Jacobi polynomials $J_{n,k}^{(a,b,c)}(x,y)$ on the triangle, as overlaps between two representation bases. The subalgebra structure of $\mathcal{J}_2$ depicted via a pentagonal graph is exploited to find the explicit expression of the two-variable functions in terms of univariate Jacobi polynomials. It is also seen to provide an explanation for the fact that the expansion on the basis $J_{n,k}^{(a,b,c)}(x,y)$ of the polynomials obtained from the latter by permuting the variables $x,y, z=1-x-y$ and the parameters $(a,b,c)$ is given in terms of Racah polynomials. The underlying order-three symmetry is discussed.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study Euclidean algorithms and the corresponding continued fractions for oriented linear Grassmanians $G(k,n)$. We propose two algorithms: Maximal Element Elimination algorithm and Minimal Element Elimination algorithm. The first algorithm reduces the absolute maximal value of the Pl\"ucker coordinates; the algorithm works only in $G(2,n)$. The second algorithm eliminates the Pl\"ucker coordinate with the smallest absolute values, while all other coordinates may increase; the algorithm works for arbitrary $G(2,n)$. We discuss basic features of these algorithms and formulate several natural open questions for further studies.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any cluster-tilting object $\mathsf{T}$ in the cluster category $\mathscr{C}_{n}$ of type $\mathbb{A}_{n}$, we construct a rank-four oriented matroid $\mathcal{M}_{\mathsf{T}}$ such that stackable triangulations of $\mathcal{M}_{\mathsf{T}}$ are in bijection with equivalence classes of maximal green sequences with initial cluster $\mathsf{T}$. This generalises the result that equivalence classes of maximal green sequences of linearly oriented $\mathbb{A}_{n}$ are in bijection with triangulations of a three-dimensional cyclic polytope. The definition of the oriented matroid $\mathcal{M}_{\mathsf{T}}$ arises from the extriangulated structure on $\mathscr{C}_{n}$ which makes $\mathsf{T}$ projective.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Functions satisfying the functional equation \begin{align*} \sum_{r=0}^{n-1} (-1)^r f(x+ry, ny) = f(x,y), \quad \text{for any positive odd integer $n$}, \end{align*} are named the alternating invariant functions. Examples of such functions include Euler polynomials, alternating Hurwitz zeta functions and their associated Gamma functions. In this paper, we systematically investigate the fundamental properties of alternating invariant functions. We prove that the set of such functions is closed under translation, reflection, and differentiation. In addition, we define a convolution operation on alternating invariant functions and derive explicit convolution formulas for Euler polynomials and alternating Hurwitz zeta functions, respectively. Furthermore, using distributional relations, we construct new examples of alternating invariant functions, including suitable combinations of trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, among others.</p></details>
