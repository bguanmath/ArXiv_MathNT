 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Cody Gilbert, Ashish K. Srivastava &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we initiate the study of quivers satisfying quantum Yang-Baxter equation. By considering quivers with quantum group like relations such as quantum Yang-Baxter equation, Hecke condition, we follow RTT construction to produce examples of Leavitt path algebras that contain quantum matrix algebra as subalgebra. Furthermore, we show that the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, and Hecke condition for our RTT construction can be generated intrinsically from the adjacency matrix of certain quivers.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Seung uk Jang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DS &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 64 pages, 14 figures; pre-submission version. Theorem C in previous version was wrong and it is fixed in this version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We discuss the algebraic dynamics on Markov cubics generated by Vieta involutions, in the tropicalized setting. It turns out that there is an invariant subset of the tropicalized Markov cubic where the action by Vieta involutions can be modeled by that of $(\infty,\infty,\infty)$-triangle reflection group on the hyperbolic plane. This understanding of the tropicalized algebraic dynamics produces some results on Markov cubics over non-archimedean fields, including the existence of the Fatou domain and finitude of orbits with rational points having prime power denominators.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sunil Kumar Pasupulati &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study Euclidean ideal classes in real biquadratic fields and obtain unconditional existence results via genus theory. Lenstra showed (assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis) that a number field with unit rank at least one admits a Euclidean ideal precisely when its class group is cyclic; subsequent work has aimed to remove the GRH hypothesis in special families. Focusing on real biquadratic fields $K=\mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{d_1},\sqrt{d_2}\right)$ with $2\nmid d_1d_2$, we prove that if the class group $\mathrm{Cl}_K$ is cyclic and the Hilbert class field $H(K)$ is abelian over $\mathbb{Q}$, then $K$ contains a Euclidean ideal class (unconditionally). We also analyse the distribution of genus numbers in a natural family of biquadratic fields and, using these statistics, show that the set of biquadratic fields admitting a Euclidean ideal has density zero.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Alessandro Ardizzoni, Claudia Menini, Paolo Saracco &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** The results previously stated only in the left Artinian case have been improved to the right perfect case, thanks to the referee's valuable comments and suggestions. Other minor updates

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Hopf envelope of a bialgebra is the free Hopf algebra generated by the given bialgebra. Its existence, as well as that of the cofree Hopf algebra, is a well-known fact in Hopf algebra theory, but their construction is not particularly handy or friendly. In this note, we offer a novel realisation of the Hopf envelope and of the cofree Hopf algebra of a finite-dimensional bialgebra as a particular quotient and sub-bialgebra, respectively, of the bialgebra itself. Our construction can also be extended to the infinite-dimensional case, provided that the bialgebra satisfies additional conditions, such as being right perfect as an algebra or admitting a $n$-antipode, the latter being a notion hereby introduced. Remarkably, the machinery we develop also allows us to give a new description of the Hopf envelope of a commutative bialgebra and of the cofree cocommutative Hopf algebra of a cocommutative bialgebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{O}_E$ be a complete discrete valuation ring and $R$ be a perfect ring in characteristic $p$, we also assume $R$ is a complete valuation ring whose valuation group is of rank one and non-discrete, we prove the Krull dimension of the ring $W_{\mathcal{O}_E}(R)$ of $\mathcal{O}_E$-Witt vectors over $R$ is at least the cardinality of the continuum.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Boaz Moerman &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 41 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish an asymptotic formula for the number of $\mathcal{M}$-points of bounded height on split toric varieties, for the height induced by any big and nef divisor class. This formula establishes new cases of the extension of Manin's conjecture to $\mathcal{M}$-points, as introduced by the author. As a special case of our result, we strengthen the results obtained by Pieropan and Schindler on Campana points of bounded height on toric varieties. As another special case, we obtain an asymptotic for the number of weak Campana points of bounded height, which is novel even for projective space. We illustrate our result by giving an asymptotic for the number of points on projective space of bounded height for which the product of coordinates is powerful.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Benedek Dombos, Jihyeug Jang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Grounded partitions, introduced by Dousse and Konan, are coloured partitions satisfying difference conditions given by a matrix with nonnegative integer entries. For the matrices studied in this paper, the generating functions are known to be infinite products, corresponding to the principal specialisation of characters of highest weight modules of type $A_1^{(1)}$. We give the first bijective proof that the generating functions of grounded partitions at level $2$ are infinite products. We then give a new combinatorial model for affine crystal graphs of type $A_1^{(1)}$ at level $2$, where the vertices are grounded partitions and the arrows are given by explicit bracketing rules. The grounded partition model for affine crystal graphs of highest weights $Λ_0$, $Λ_1$ and $Λ_0 + Λ_1$ gives rise to new $q$-series identities obtained by decomposing the affine crystal graphs into the crystal graphs of finite type $A_1$ via the restricted representation.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 40 pp, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a complete discretely valued field with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}$ and residue field of characteristic $p>2$. Let $G=\mathrm{GO}_{2n}$ denote the split orthogonal similitude group over $F$. For any parahoric level structure, we prove that the associated spin local model for $G$ is a flat $\mathcal{O}$-scheme with reduced special fiber, provided either $p$ is sufficiently large or $n\leq 4$. This partially confirms a conjecture of Pappas and Rapoport. As a corollary, we obtain a flat (integral) moduli space of PEL-type D under the same assumptions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a non-trivial bound for $\mathrm{Sp}(2n)$ Kloosterman sums of moduli not equal to a prime multiple of the identity. These sums are attached to Siegel modular forms on the group $\mathrm{Sp}(2n)$ and appear in the corresponding Petersson formula. We give an application to equidistribution of coprime symmetric pairs.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Corrections throughout. Final proofreading before submission to a journal

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a reductive group over a local field $F$ and let $ρ:{}^LG \to \mathrm{GL}_{V_ρ}(\mathbb{C})$ be a representation of its $L$-group satisfying suitable assumptions. Braverman, Kazhdan and Ngô conjectured that one has a Schwartz space $\mathcal{S}_ρ(G(F))$ of functions on $G(F)$ that admits a Fourier transform and satisfies certain desiderata. We prove a large portion of this conjecture. More precisely, we construct these Schwartz spaces over non-Archimedean local fields and construct an approximation to them over Archimedean fields. Our methods are spectral in nature.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we use Plücker relations in the Grassmannian $Gr(3,n)$ to give relations that hold amongst some of the entries of the Heronian frieze of order $n$. Furthermore, we make a connection between certain subfriezes of a Heronian frieze and Plücker friezes $P(3,n)$, and then show that some determinants of the matrices whose elements lie in those subfriezes are vanishing.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16597v1'>2512.16597</a>\]&nbsp; **On Properly $θ$-Congruent Numbers Over Real Number Fields**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sajad Salami, Arman Shamsi Zargar &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The notion of $θ$-congruent numbers generalizes the classical congruent number problem. Recall that a positive integer $n$ is $θ$-congruent if it is the area of a rational triangle with an angle $θ$ whose cosine is rational. Das and Saikia [2] established criteria for numbers to be $θ$-congruent over certain real number fields and concluded their work by posing four open questions regarding the relationship between $θ$-congruent and properly $θ$-congruent numbers. In this work, we provide complete answers to those questions. Indeed, we remove a technical assumption from their result on fields with degrees coprime to $6$, provide a definitive answer for real cubic fields without congruence restrictions, extend the analysis to fields of degree~$6$, and examine the exceptional cases $n=1, 2, 3$ and $6$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sajad Salami, Arman Shamsi Zargar &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The splitting field of an elliptic surface $\mathcal E$ defined over ${\mathbb Q}(t)$ is the smallest subfield $\mathcal K$ of $\mathbb C$ such that ${\mathcal E}({\mathbb C}(t))\cong {\mathcal E}({\mathcal K}(t))$. In this paper, we determine the splitting field ${\mathcal K}_m$ and a set of linearly independent generators for the Mordell--Weil lattice of Shioda's elliptic surface with generic fiber given by ${\mathcal E}_m: y^2=x^3 +t^{m} +1$ over ${\mathbb Q}(t)$ for positive integers $1\leq m\leq 12$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Edgar Assing, Radu Toma &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 135 pages, 7 figures; improved version, with less typos and slightly more details, thanks to reviewers

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The orbit method in its quantitative form due to Nelson and Venkatesh has played a central role in recent advances in the analytic theory of higher rank $L$-functions. The goal of this note is to explain how the method can be applied to the sup-norm problem for automorphic forms on $\mathrm{PGL}(2)$. Doing so, we prove a new hybrid bound for newforms $\varphi$ of large prime-power level $N = p^{4n}$ and large eigenvalue $λ$. It states that $\| \varphi \|_\infty \ll_p (λN)^{5/24 + \varepsilon}$, recovering the result of Iwaniec and Sarnak spectrally and improving the local bound in the depth aspect for the first time in this non-compact setting. We also provide an exposition of the microlocal tools used, illustrating and motivating the theory through the classical case of $\mathrm{PGL}(2)$, following notes and lectures of Nelson and Venkatesh.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Fatma Çiçek, Pranendu Darbar, Allysa Lumley &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the function field setting with a fixed characteristic, it was proven by the second and third authors that the values $\log \big|L\big(\frac12, χ_D\big)\big|$ as $D$ varies over monic and square-free polynomials are asymptotically Gaussian distributed on the assumption of a low lying zeros hypothesis as the degree of $D$ tends to $\infty$. For real distinct shifts $t_j$ all of microscopic size or all of nonmicroscopic size relative to the genus, we consider linear combinations of $\log\big|L\big(\frac12+it_j, χ_D\big)\big|$ with real coefficients, and separately, of $\arg L\big(\frac12+it_j, χ_D\big).$ We provide estimates for their distribution functions under the low lying zeros hypothesis. We similarly study distribution functions of linear combinations of $\log\big|L\big(\frac12+it_j, E\otimes χ_D\big)\big|$, and separately $\arg L\big(\frac12+it_j, E\otimesχ_D\big)$, for quadratic twists of elliptic curves $E$ with root number one as the conductor gets large. As an application of these results, we prove a central limit theorem for the fluctuation of the number of nontrivial zeros of such $L$-functions from its mean, and thus recover previous results by Faifman and Rudnick. Correlations of such fluctuations are in harmony with the results of Bourgade, Coram and Diaconis, and Wieand for zeros of the Riemann zeta function and for eigenangles of unitary random matrices.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 4 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a short and elementary argument answering a question of Erdős and Ingham negatively. Erdős and Ingham showed that a Tauberian estimate they considered was equivalent to the non-vanishing of $1+\sum_{k}a_k^{-1-it}$ for any real number $t$ and any sequence $1<a_1<a_2<\cdots$ of positive integers such that $\sum_k a_k^{-1}<\infty$. We disprove this statement. In fact, we show that for any complex number $λ$ and any non-zero real number $t$, there exists a sequence $1<a_1<a_2<\cdots$ of positive integers such that $\sum_k a_k^{-1}<\infty$ and $\sum_k a_k^{-1-it} = λ$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 13 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using a construction of Kanemitsu from [9] and observations by Rampazzo in [19], we find examples of zero divisors in the Grothendieck ring of varieties by taking the zero loci of sections of vector bundles over symplectic and $F_4$ Grassmannians. These zero divisors yield instances of non-trivially L-equivalent Calabi-Yau varieties. This methodology is inspired by a similar process performed by Ito et al. on $G_2$ Grassmannians in [8].</p></details>

Let $x$ be large, and assume that, for some real number $τ$, the quantities $r(p)-\Re\{f(p)/p^{iτ}\}$ are small in various appropriate average senses over the set of prime numbers not exceeding $x$. We derive from recent effective mean-value estimates an effective comparison theorem between the mean-values of $f$ and of $r$ on the set of integers $\leqslant x$. We also provide effective estimates for certain weighted moments of additive functions and for sifted mean-values of non-negative multiplicative functions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** (i) An important case from [5] missing in the first version is now included as Theorem 1.5. (ii) The paper has been substantially rewritten. The main results have been refined, and several proofs have been simplified to improve readability. (iii) Examples illustrating several of the main results proved here were discovered by S. Oh, and we elaborate on them further in this revision

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is subsequent to [5]. In this paper, we extend the classification of hyperbolic Dehn fillings with sufficiently large coefficients by addressing the remaining case not covered in [5]. Specifically, by considering the case in which the two cusp shapes lie in the same quadratic field, we obtain the complete classification under a mild assumption satisfied by most manifolds. The content of this paper is not limited to the classification of hyperbolic Dehn fillings. Along the way, we also classify key types of automorphisms of the holonomy variety of a two-cusped hyperbolic $3$-manifold and uncover an intriguing hidden structure in the complex volume of certain manifolds. Concrete examples illustrating these phenomena were discovered by S. Oh, and we elaborate on them in this paper. All the results presented here appear to be effective. In the third paper of this series, joint with S. Oh, we will provide examples confirming the optimality of our results.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 7 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The sequence $A067549$ of The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences is defined as $(a_k)_{k \geq 1}$ with $a_k$ being the determinant of the $k \times k$ matrix whose diagonal contains the first $k$ prime numbers and all other elements are ones. We relate this sequence to a concrete counting problem. Choose an arbitrary residue class $r_i$ for each prime $p_i$ with $1 \leq i \leq k$ and set $P_k = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i$. We show that $a_k$ is the number of integers in $[1, P_k]$ that are contained in \emph{at most} one of the $k$ chosen residue classes. Interestingly, we show that this sequence is closely related to the better known sequence $A005867$ for which we derive a novel characterisation in terms of determinants and which gives the number of integers in $[1, P_k]$ that are not contained in any of the $k$ residue classes. Our proof is purely structural and, therefore, it can be generalised to counting appearances of integers in residue classes of arbitrary arithmetic progressions generated by $k$ different primes using the determinant of a matrix of ones having those $k$ primes on its diagonal.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a complete description of the A$_\infty$ deformation theory of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of graded surfaces. We show that any abstract A$_\infty$ deformation is "geometric", namely it is equivalent to the partially wrapped Fukaya category of an orbifold surface obtained as a partial compactification of the original surface. For certain genus 0 surfaces, these deformations are generically Fukaya categories of compact pillowcases. We introduce the notion of a weak dual and use unbounded twisted complexes to overcome the curvature problem that naturally arises when some of the boundary components are fully wrapped. Our results provide a first account of the relationship between A$_\infty$ deformations of Fukaya categories and partial compactifications, as advocated in P. Seidel's ICM 2002 address, in the presence of stop data. All of our results also hold when the original surface has finitely many order 2 orbifold points.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We assemble three basic analytic inputs -- the Kuznetsov trace formula on $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ with explicit continuous spectrum, the $\mathrm{GL}_3$ Voronoi formula, and $t$-aspect second-moment bounds for $L(1/2+it,\varphi)$ -- into a single framework for a smoothed $\mathrm{GL}_3$ spectral average. For a fixed Hecke-Maass cusp form $\varphi$ on $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb Z)$, we evaluate a weight-$0$ spectral average of $L(1/2,\varphi\times f_j)$ over the $\mathrm{GL}_2$ Maass spectrum. In the Kuznetsov normalization where the diagonal transform has density $t\tanh(πt)$, the diagonal contributes exactly $2\mathcal H_0[h]$; the off-diagonal and the continuous spectrum are bounded with power savings consistent with the currently best unconditional second-moment bounds in the $\mathrm{GL}_3$ $t$-aspect. The argument is organized into a sequence of steps: normalizations and approximate functional equations, insertion into Kuznetsov, Voronoi summation on $\mathrm{GL}_3$, a bilinear estimate for the off-diagonal, evaluation of the diagonal and the Eisenstein contribution, moment refinements and parameter optimization, and finally plateau-smooth spectral windows and standard generalizations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Heilbronn gave a sufficient condition for a number field with a totally ramified prime to fail to be norm-Euclidean. We say that Heilbronn's criterion applies to a polynomial $f$ if it applies to the number field $K=\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f)$ generated by $f$. Suppose $n\geq 3$ is odd and $p\geq 5$ is prime with $\gcd(p-1,n)=1$. Let $\mathcal{F}_{p,n}$ denote the collection of monic polynomials $f\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ of degree $n$ that are Eisenstein at the prime $p$. We order our polynomials by the natural height $\mathrm{Ht}(f)$. Define $δ_{p,n}(X)$ to be the proportion of polynomials $f\in\mathcal{F}_{p,n}$ with $\mathrm{Ht}(f)\leq X$ for which Heilbronn's criterion applies. One has $$\liminf_{X\to\infty}δ_{p,n}(X)\geq \max\left\{\frac{2}{27}\,,\;1-\varepsilon(p)\right\}\,,$$ where $\varepsilon(p)\to 0$ and is effectively computable. In particular, the lower density tends to $1$ as $p\to\infty$ uniformly in $n$. We also give a version of this result where we weaken the condition on $\gcd(p-1,n)$. As a corollary, we show that given an integer $n\geq 2$, a positive proportion of Eisenstein polynomials of degree $n$ fail to generate norm-Euclidean fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we investigate multiple polylogarithms with non-positive multi-indices (nonpositive MPLs) from a combinatorial and algebraic viewpoint. By introducing a correspondence between non-positive multiple polylogarithms and Magnus polynomials in a free associative algebra, we obtain an explicit Magnus-type representation of products of mono-indexed non-positive MPLs. The main identity (Theorem A) expresses such a product as a single non-positive MPL indexed by a Magnus polynomial, which may be regarded as a Möbius inversion of the expansion formula due to Duchamp-Hoang Ngoc Minh-Ngo. Moreover, we study the effects of permuted indices and show that certain differences of Magnus polynomials belong to the kernel of the linear map ${\rm Li}^-_{\bullet}$ , leading to new functional equations among non-positive MPLs of the same weight and depth. These results clarify the combinatorial structure underlying non-positive MPLs and reveal a close connection with the Magnus expansion in non-commutative algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The well-known Hardy--Ramanujan inequality states that if $ω(n)$ denotes the number of distinct prime factors of a positive integer $n$, then there is an absolute constant $C>0$ such that uniformly for $x\ge2$ and $k\in\mathbb{N}$, $$\#\{n\le x\colonω(n)=k\}\ll\frac{x(\log\log x+C)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!\log x}.$$ A myriad of generalizations and variations of this inequality have been discovered. In this paper, we establish a weighted version of this inequality for sifted sets, which generalizes an earlier result of Halász and implies Timofeev's theorems on shifted primes. We then explore its applications to a variety of intriguing problems, such as large deviations of $ω$ on subsets of integers, the Erdős multiplication table problem, divisors of shifted primes, and the image of the Carmichael $λ$-function. Building on the same circle of ideas, we also generalize Troupe's result on the normal order of $ω(s(n))$ for the sum-of-proper-divisors function $s(n)$, confirming for the first time the weighted version of a special case of a 1992 conjecture by Erdős, Granville, Pomerance, and Spiro.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Zamolodchikov periodicity is a property of certain discrete dynamical systems and was one of the primary motivations for the creation of cluster algebras. It was first observed by Zamolodchikov in his study of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, initially for simply-laced Dynkin diagrams. It was proved by Keller to hold for tensor products of two Dynkin diagrams, and further shown by Galashin and Pylyavskyy to hold for pairs of commuting simply-laced Cartan matrices of finite type, which Stembridge classified in his study of admissible $W$-cells. We prove that the Zamolodchikov periodic cluster algebras are in bijection with pairs of commuting (not necessarily reduced or simply-laced) Cartan matrices of finite type. We fully classify all such pairs into 29 infinite families and 14 exceptional types in addition to the 6 infinite families and 11 exceptional types in Stembridge's classification, and show that all of these families can be derived from simply-laced types through two operations preserving Zamolodchikov periodicity, folding and taking transpose. Our work holds connections to Kazhdan--Lusztig theory, and our main theorem helps classify all nonnegative $W$-cells for products of two dihedral groups, $W = I_2(p)\times I_2(q)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For semisimple Lie algebras, the BGG resolution is commonly interpreted as a categorification of the Weyl character formula. For general linear Lie superalgebras, the Kac--Wakimoto character formula is regarded as a good character formula for a certain class of ``singular'' weights (the so-called Kac--Wakimoto weights). However, the combinatorial factor $\frac{1}{\mathrm{atyp}(λ)!}$ makes a direct BGG-type categorification of this formula rather elusive. In this paper we construct, for a certain class of ``generic'' weights, a resolution that categorifies a known Weyl-type finite-sum character formula of the same flavour as the Kac--Wakimoto formula. Our resolution is built from taking images of canonical homomorphisms between Verma modules corresponding to non-conjugate Borel subalgebras via odd reflections. Note that, while the infinite resolution of Kac--Wakimoto simple modules by Kac modules constructed by Brundan--Stroppel~\cite{brundan2010highestII} does not directly generalize the classical BGG resolution, the construction developed here does.</p></details>

We then introduce the generalized discrete Markov spectrum, defined analogously via the generalized Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k_1 yz + k_2 zx + k_3 xy = (3 + k_1 + k_2 + k_3) xyz.$ We prove that this generalized spectrum is contained in the Markov-Lagrange spectrum and thus the Markov spectrum.</p></details>

We prove more generally that the Hodge bundle of a Calabi--Yau variation of Hodge structures is semiample subject to some extra conditions, and as our second result deduce the b-semiampleness conjecture and the existence of a functorial Hodge-theoretic compactification of moduli spaces of polarized Calabi--Yau varieties. The semiampleness results (and the construction of the Baily--Borel compactifications) crucially use o-minimal GAGA, and the deduction of the b-semiampleness conjecture uses work of Ambro and results of Kollár on the geometry of minimal lc centers to verify the extra conditions.</p></details>

More precisely, we demonstrate that if the function $p_f(t):=f(t)(e^t-1)/t$, called the \textit{modulator} of $L(s,f)$, exhibits even or odd symmetry, the \textit{LC-function formula} -- a generalization of the Hurwitz formula -- naturally simplifies to a functional equation analogous to that of the Dirichlet L-function $L(s,χ)$, associated to a primitive character $χ$ of inherent parity. Furthermore, using this equation, we derive a general formula for the values of these LC-functions at even or odd positive integers, depending on whether the modulator $p_f$ is even or odd, respectively.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2008, Pritsker introduced the areal Mahler measure, which is defined using an integral over the unit disk, as opposed to the classical Mahler measure which is defined using an integral over the unit circle. In this paper we introduce areal Weil heights, which generalize the areal Mahler measure to the adelic setting. We use the framework of adelic heights established by Favre and Rivera-Letelier and we construct a $p$-adic analog for the area measure on a disk in $\mathbb{C}$. For areal Weil heights we prove an analog of Kronecker's theorem, which characterizes their small points and essential minima. Furthermore, we determine equidistribution theorems for areal Weil heights. In some cases, they have a unique limiting distribution for small points, while in others there are infinitely many limiting distributions. We conclude with examples. In one of our examples, we determine for which radii $r$ there exist sequences of conjugate sets of algebraic integers which uniformly distribute to the disk $D(0,r) \subset \mathbb{C}$, and we compute the limiting height for such sequences.</p></details>

We consider the specialized skew hook Schur polynomial $\text{hs}_{λ/μ}(X,ωX,\dots,ω^{t-1}X/Y,ωY,\dots,ω^{t-1}Y)$, where $ω^k X=(ω^k x_1, \dots, ω^k x_n)$, $ω^k Y=(ω^k y_1, \dots, ω^k y_m)$ for $0 \leq k \leq t-1$. We characterize the skew shapes $λ/μ$ for which the polynomial vanishes and prove that the nonzero polynomial factorizes into smaller skew hook Schur polynomials. Then we give a combinatorial interpretation of $\text{hs}_{λ/μ}(1,ω^d,\dots,ω^{d(tn-1)}/1,ω^d,\dots,ω^{d(tm-1)})$, for all divisors $d$ of $t$, in terms of ribbon supertableaux. Lastly, we use the combinatorial interpretation to prove the cyclic sieving phenomenon on the set of semistandard supertableaux of shape $λ/μ$ for odd $t$. Using a similar proof strategy, we give a complete generalization of a result of Lee--Oh (arXiv: 2112.12394, 2021) for the cyclic sieving phenomenon on the set of skew SSYT conjectured by Alexandersson--Pfannerer--Rubey--Uhlin (Forum Math.

> **Comment:** The presentation has been polished and slightly expanded. In particular, the background is discussed quite thoroughly, namely the brick labels of neighbor torsion classes. Also, brick finiteness is now characterized in several ways, including a reference to $τ$-tilting theory

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We deal with the category of finitely generated modules over an artin algebra $A$. Recall that an object in an abelian category is said to be a brick provided its endomorphism ring is a division ring. Simple modules are, of course, bricks, but in case $A$ is connected and not local, there do exist bricks which are not simple. The aim of this survey is to focus the attention to filtrations of modules where all factors are bricks, with bricks being ordered in some definite way. In general, a module category will have many oriented cycles. Recently, Demonet has proposed to look at so-called brick chains in order to deal with a very interesting directedness feature of a module category. These are the orderings of bricks which we will use. This is a survey which relies on recent investigations by a quite large group of mathematicians. We have singled out some important observations and have reordered them in order to obtain a completely self-contained (and elementary) treatment of the relevance of bricks in a module category. (Most of the papers we rely on are devoted to what is called $τ$-tilting theory, but for the results we are interested in, there is no need to deal with $τ$-tilting, or even with the Auslander-Reiten translation $τ$).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The category $\bcalNT$ was defined in \cite{Lobos2}, it is a category whose objects are commutative nil graded algebras over a field, defined by presentation encoded by triangular matrices. A natural problem related to this category is to reach a complete classification up to isomorphism of its objects. Based in some results coming from \cite{Lobos2}, we can divide this problem by working with encoding matrices of a fixed size $n.$ In \cite{Lobos3} and \cite{Lobos4}, there are several advances for this search, in particular, in \cite{Lobos3} one can see that, for small matrices, the number of isomorphism classes seems to be finite and independent on the ground field. That fact, opened a series of questions related with the number of isomorphism classes and its relation with the ground field. At that point it was no clear, under which conditions of the ground field, this number could be finite. In this article, among other results, we prove that for each $n\geq4,$ the number of isomorphism classes is finite if and only if the ground field is finite.</p></details>

Tauberian theorems appear in a tremendous variety of applications, ranging from well-known classical applications in analytic number theory, to new applications in arithmetic statistics, group theory, and the intersection of number theory and algebraic geometry. The goal of this article is to provide a useful reference for practitioners who wish to apply a Tauberian theorem. We explain the hypotheses and proofs of two types of Tauberian theorems: one with and one without an explicit remainder term. We furthermore provide counterexamples that illuminate that neither theorem can reach an essentially stronger conclusion unless its hypothesis is strengthened.</p></details>

In this work, we classify the orbits of this action in the case of Φ = F_4 in terms of supports of canonical forms.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A(s) = \sum_n a_n n^{-s}$ be a Dirichlet series admitting meromorphic continuation to the complex plane. Assume we know the location of the poles of $A(s)$ with $|\Im s| \leq T$, and their residues, for some large constant $T$. It is natural to ask how such finite spectral information may be best used to estimate partial sums $\sum_{n\leq x} a_n$. Here, we prove a sharp, general result on sums $\sum_{n\leq x} a_n n^{-σ}$ for $a_n$ non-negative, giving an optimal way to use information on the poles of $A(s)$ with $|\Im s|\leq T$, with no need for zero-free regions. We give not just bounds, but an explicit formula with compact support. Our bounds on $ψ(x)-x$ are, unsurprisingly, better and often simpler than a long list of existing explicit versions of the Prime Number Theorem. We treat the case of $M(x)$ and similar functions in a companion paper. Our solution mixes a Fourier-analytic approach in the style of Wiener--Ikehara with contour-shifting, using optimal approximants of Beurling--Selberg type found in (Graham--Vaaler, 1981).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $d\geq 2$ be an integer, $K_0$ a perfect field such that $char(K_0)$ does not divide $d$, $n > d$ an integer prime to $d$, $f(x)\in K_0[x]$ a degree $n$ monic polynomial without repeated roots, and $C_{f,d}$ a smooth projective model of the affine curve $y^d=f(x)$. Let $J(C_{f,d})$ be the Jacobian of the $K_0$-curve $C_{f,d} $. We identify $C_{f,d}$ with its canonical image in $J(C_{f,d})$ (such that the infinite point of $C_{f,d}$ goes to the zero of the group law on $J(C_{f,d})$). We say that an integer $m>1$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K_0$ if there exists a polynomial $f(x)$ as above such that $C_{f,d}(K_0)$ contains a torsion point of order $m$. Earlier we proved that if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable, then either $m=d$ or $m \geq n$ (in addition, both $d$ and $n$ are $(n,d)$-reachable). In the present paper we prove the following. If $n<m<2n$ and if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K_0$, then either $d|m$ or $m \equiv n \bmod d$. If either $char(K_0)=0$ or $K_0$ in infinite and $char(K_0)>n$, then $d\cdot [(n+d)/d]$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if and only if $n-(d-1)\cdot [(n+d)/d]\ge 0$. If $char(K_0)=0$, then $n+d$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if and only if $d^2-2d<n$. If $d=2$ (the hyperelliptic case) and $char(K_0)=0$, then $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if $n+1 \le m \le 2n+1$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study GL-equivariant modules over the infinite variable polynomial ring $S = k[x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, ...]$ with $k$ an infinite field of characteristic $p > 0$. We extend many of Sam--Snowden's far-reaching results from characteristic zero to this setting. For example, while the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of a finitely generated GL-equivariant $S$-module need not be finite in positive characteristic, we show that the resolution still has finitely many "linear strands of higher slope". The crux of this paper is two technical results. The first is an extension to positive characteristic of Snowden's recent linearization of Draisma's embedding theorem which we use to study the generic category of $S$-modules. The second is a Nagpal-type "shift theorem" about torsion $S$-modules for which we introduce certain categorifications of the Hasse derivative. These two results together allow us to obtain explicit generators for the derived category. In a follow-up paper, we also use these results to prove finiteness results for local cohomology modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The low-energy expansion of genus-one string amplitudes produces infinite families of non-holomorphic modular forms after each step of integrating over a point on the torus worldsheet which are known as elliptic modular graph forms (eMGFs). We solve the differential equations of eMGFs depending on a single point $z$ and the modular parameter $τ$ via iterated integrals over holomorphic modular forms which individually transform inhomogeneously under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$. Suitable generating series of these iterated integrals over $τ$, their complex conjugates and single-valued multiple zeta values (svMZVs) are combined to attain equivariant transformations under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ such that their components are modular forms. Our generating series of equivariant iterated integrals for eMGFs is related to elliptic multiple polylogarithms (eMPLs) through a gauge transform of the flat Calaque-Enriquez-Etingof connection. By converting iterated $τ$-integrals to iterated integrals over points on a torus, we arrive at an explicit construction of single-valued eMPLs where all the monodromies in the points cancel. Each single-valued eMPL depending on a single point $z$ is found to be a finite combination of meromorphic eMPLs, their complex conjugates, svMZVs and equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals. Our generating series determines the latter two admixtures via so-called zeta generators and Tsunogai derivations which act on the two generators $x$, $y$ of a free Lie algebra and where the coefficients of words in $x,y$ define the single-valued eMPLs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider certain families of Hecke characters $φ$ over a quadratic imaginary field $F$. According to the Bloch-Beilinson conjectures, the order of vanishing of the $L$-function $L(φ,s)$ at the central point $s=-1$ should be equal to the dimension of the space of extensions of the Tate motive $\mathbb{Q}(1)$ by the motive associated with $φ$. In this article, we construct candidates for the corresponding extensions of Hodge structures, assuming that the sign of the functional equation of $L(φ,s)$ is $-1$. This is accomplished through the cohomology of variations of Hodge structures over Picard modular surfaces associated with $F$ and Harder's theory of Eisenstein cohomology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these extensions are naturally realized within certain biextensions. We outline a program to compute the biextension height and utilize it to establish the non-triviality of these extensions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 30 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of lacunary trigonometric sums $S_n(ω) := \sum_{k=1}^n \cos (2 πa_k ω)$, $ω\in[0,1]$, and show that cumulant growth is highly sensitive to the arithmetic structure of the sequence $(a_k)_{k \geq 1}$ of positive integers. In particular, if $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_{k+1}/a_k = η> 1$ for some transcendental number $η$, we prove that for every $m\in \mathbb N$ the $m$-th cumulant of $S_n$ is asymptotically equivalent to the $m$-th cumulant of the ``independent model'' $\widetilde{S}_n := \sum_{k=1}^n \cos (2 πa_k U_k)$, where $U_1, U_2, \dots$ are independent random variables having uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. In particular, the order of growth of the cumulants as $n \to \infty$ is linear in this case. We also show that the transcendence condition for $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_{k+1}/a_k$ is in general necessary: when the ratio limit $η$ is algebraic, the cumulants of $S_n$ may have a different asymptotic order from those of $\widetilde{S}_n$. For instance, for $a_k = 2^k+1$ (with $η= 2$), the sixth cumulant of $S_n$ grows quadratically in $n$. In contrast, for $a_k = 2^k$ (again $η= 2$) or when $(a_k)_{k \geq 1}$ is the Fibonacci sequence (with $η= (1+\sqrt 5)/2$), the $m$-th cumulant of $S_n$ grows linearly as $n\to\infty$, but with a growth rate that differs from the one of the independent model $\widetilde{S}_n$. Overall, our results show that the asymptotic behavior of the cumulants of lacunary trigonometric sums depends on arithmetic effects in a very delicate way. This is particularly remarkable since many other probabilistic limit theorems, such as the Central Limit Theorem, hold for lacunary trigonometric sums in a universal way without any such sensitivity towards arithmetic effects.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide explicit formulas for quadratic Gauss sums over $\mathbb{Z}^n/c\mathbb{Z}^n$, which generalize some of the existing formulas, e.g., Skoruppa and Zagier's (for $n=2$), and Iwaniec and Kowalski's (for arbitrary $n$). We then give four main applications. As the first application, we prove a duality theorem, which relates a sum over a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}^n/c\mathbb{Z}^n$ to another sum over the orthogonal complement. This allows us to give explicit formulas for quadratic Gauss partial sums over certain subgroups. As the second application, we give an explicit formula for the coefficients of Weil representations of $\mathrm{Mp}_2(\mathbb{Z})$, which has the advantage, compared to Scheithauer's, Strömberg's, and Boylan and Skoruppa's formulas, that it involves neither local data nor limits of theta series. As the third application, we provide an explicit formula for the number of solutions of an arbitrary quadratic congruence in $n$ variables modulo a prime, as well as an efficient formula modulo a general integer. As the final application, we give a uniform formula for the number of solutions of the Diophantine equation $dxyz=Q(x,y,z)$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$, where $Q$ is an arbitrary integral quadratic form with some weak restrictions. This generalizes a result of Baragar regarding the Markoff equation. There is also a formula relating Hecke Gauss sums to sums over $\mathbb{Z}^n/c\mathbb{Z}^n$, an explicit formula for Hecke Gauss sums over quadratic fields, and an example of computing a Hecke Gauss sum over a cyclotomic field.</p></details>

As an application, we prove that the natural embedding $\imath:\widetilde{\mathbf{U}}^\imath\to \widetilde{\mathbf{U}}$, and the coproduct $Δ:\widetilde{\mathbf{U}}^\imath\to \widetilde{\mathbf{U}}^\imath\otimes \widetilde{\mathbf{U}}$ preserve the integral forms of $\widetilde{\mathbf{U}}^\imath$ and $\widetilde{\mathbf{U}}$, which are used to construct the dual canonical bases.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>About a century ago, P. A. MacMahon introduced a class of $q$-series, which are nowadays referred to as MacMahon series. More recently, in 2013, G. E. Andrews and S. C. F. Rose revealed the quasimodular property of these series. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of MacMahon series. Specifically, for any positive integers $t, k, N$ and a polynomial $Q(x)$, we define the series $\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}(Q; q)$ and $\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}^{\star}(Q; q)$ using the $N$-th cyclotomic polynomial. To investigate these series, we apply a decomposition formula involving the Eulerian polynomials and express the $N$-th roots of unity in terms of Gauss sums. By combining these results to derive explicit representations, we prove that our series arise as quasimodular forms of higher weight and higher level. Furthermore, we show that they can be expressed as isobaric polynomials. In particular, we show that the one-parameter generalization introduced by C. Nazaroglu, B. V. Pandey, and A. Singh arises as a special case of our theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the problem of finding integer triangles with $R/r$ a positive rational, where $R$ and $r$ are the radii of the circumcircle and an excircle, respectively. We show that for general triangles $R/r>1/4$ applies. The equation $R/r=N$ turns out to be related to the elliptic curve $\mathcal{E}_N$ given by $v^2=u^3+2(2N^2+2N-1)u^2-(4N-1)u$. If $N>1/4$ is rational, then the torsion group of $\mathcal{E}_N$ is $\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z\times\mathbb Z/6\mathbb Z$ if $N(N+2)$ is a square and $\mathbb Z/6\mathbb Z$ otherwise. We show that a rational triangle with rational ratio $R/r=N$ exists if and only if $N>1/4$ and there exists a rational non-torsion point on the curve $\mathcal{E}_N$ which satisfies a certain condition. Furthermore, we show that the rank of $\mathcal{E}_N$ is positive when $N = m^2 \pm 1>1/4$ for a rational $m$. We also show that on every curve $\mathcal{E}_N$ whose rank is positive, there are infinitely many rational points which lead to infinitely many non-similar integer triangles with $R/r=N$.</p></details>

Let $r_{μλ}$ denote the multiplicity of the irreducible representation $V_μ$ of $S_n$, corresponding to a partition $μ$ of $n$, in the restriction of an irreducible polynomial representation $W_λ(\mathbb{C})$ of $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$, corresponding to a partition $λ$ with at most $n$ parts. Finding a combinatorial interpretation for $r_{μλ}$ remains an open problem in algebraic combinatorics, called the \emph{restriction problem}. We derive a new nonrecursive expression for a character polynomial called the \emph{Specht polynomial} and use it to find a combinatorial interpretation of $r_{μλ}$ when $λ$ is a hook-shaped partition.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 64 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A result of Pyber states that every finite group $G$ contains an abelian subgroup whose order is quasi-polynomially large in $\lvert G\rvert$. We prove a similar result for $K$-approximate subgroups of solvable groups under only modest restrictions on $K$. We show that, if $A$ is a finite $K$-approximate group contained in some solvable group, then some abelian group intersects $A^4$ in at least $\exp(Ω(\log^{1/6}\lvert A\rvert/\log 2K))$ elements. We also prove a similar result for approximate subgroups of finite groups with no large alternating subquotients. Along the way, we obtain polynomial (instead of quasi-polynomial) bounds for the same statement of approximate subgroups of linear groups. We give two applications. Firstly, we consider the conjecture of Alon that every finite group $G$ admits a Cayley graph with clique number and independence number $O(\log\lvert G\rvert)$. Conlon, Fox, Pham, and Yepremyan have recently proven that, for almost all positive integers $N$, every abelian group of order $N$ satisfies Alon's conjecture. Extending their result, we verify Alon's conjecture for all (not necessarily abelian) groups of almost all orders. Secondly, we prove a "local" version of Roth's theorem in (many) non-abelian settings with quasi-polynomial bounds, using the recent breakthroughs of Kelley and Meka on Roth's theorem and of Jaber, Liu, Lovett, Ostuni, and Sawhney on the corners problem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that, up to scaling, there exist only finitely many isometry classes of Hermitian lattices over $O_E$ of signature $(1,n)$ that admit ball quotients of non-general type, where $n>12$ is even and $E=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-D})$ for an odd discriminant $-D<-3$. Furthermore, we show that even-dimensional ball quotients, associated with arithmetic subgroups of $\mathrm{U}(1,n)$ defined over $E$, are always of general type if $n > 207$, or $n>12$ and $D>2557$. To establish these results, we construct a nontrivial full-level cusp form of weight $n$ on the $n$-dimensional complex ball. A key ingredient in our proof is the use of Arthur's multiplicity formula from the theory of automorphic representations.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 7 pages. Dedicated to the memory of Christine Bessenrodt

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Saxl's conjecture (2012) asserts that for the staircase partition $ρ_k = (k, k-1, \ldots, 1)$, the tensor square of the corresponding irreducible representation of the symmetric group $S_{T_k}$ contains every irreducible representation as a constituent, where $T_k = k(k+1)/2$ is the $k$th triangular number. We prove this conjecture unconditionally. Our proof introduces the Staircase Minimality Theorem: among all 2-regular partitions of $T_k$, the staircase $ρ_k$ is the unique dominance-minimal element. Combined with Ikenmeyer's theorem on dominance and Kronecker positivity for staircases, this establishes that every 2-regular partition appears in the tensor square. Modular saturation then follows using only the diagonal entries $d_{μμ} = 1$ of the decomposition matrix, and the Bessenrodt--Bowman--Sutton lifting theorem completes the proof. We further prove that at triangular numbers, staircases are the only Kronecker-universal self-conjugate partitions, providing a complete characterization.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There are three aims in this paper: (i) We show an isomorphism between Jacobi forms of index $D_{2n+1}$ (lattice index) and elliptic modular forms of level $2$. (ii) We give an explicit formula of Fourier coefficients of Jacobi-Eisenstein series of index $D_{2n+1}$. (iii) We construct a holomorphic modular form of weight $3/2$ of level $8$ from the Zagier Eisenstein series $\mathscr{F}$ of weight $3/2$ of level $4$. Moreover, we show that the four functions $E^*_2$, $η^3$, $θ^3$ and $\mathscr{F}$ have essentially the same Hecke eigenvalue $1+p$ for any odd prime $p$, where $E^*_2$ is the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series of weight $2$, $η$ is the Dedekind eta-function and $θ$ is the usual theta function. This fact follows from a special case of the isomorphism of (i).

The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $γ+ δ/e = \mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $γ^{(n)} + δ^{(n)}/e = η^{(n)}$; $n \ge 0$ for sequences of constants $γ^{(n)}$, $δ^{(n)}$, and $η^{(n)}$ (given respectively by raw, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). Investigating the $γ^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations, we find that at least one of the pair {$γ,γ^{(2)}$} and at least two of each of the sets {$γ,γ^{(2)},γ^{(3)},γ^{(4)}$}, {$γ,γ^{(3)},γ^{(4)},\ldots,γ^{(6)}$}, and {$γ,γ^{(4)},γ^{(5)},\ldots,γ^{(8)}$} are transcendental, implying analogous results for the sequence $Γ^{(n)}(1)=\left(-1\right)^{n}γ^{\left(n\right)}$. We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $η^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent, and therefore transcendental, for all $n \ge 0$, implying that at least one of each pair, {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e$} and {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e,δ^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n \ge 1$. Further analysis of the $γ^{(n)}$ and $η^{(n)}$ reveals that the values $δ^{(n)}/e$ are transcendental infinitely often, with the density of the set of transcendental terms having asymptotic lower bound $1/2-o(1)$. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tildeδ^{(n)}$ and $\tildeη^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $γ^{(n)} + \tildeδ^{(n)}/e = \tildeη^{(n)}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Donoso, Le, Moreira and Sun studied the asymptotic behavior of the averages of completely multiplicative functions over the Gaussian integers. They derived Wirsing's theorem for Gaussian integers, answered a question of Frantzikinakis and Host for sum of two squares, and obtained a variant of a theorem of Bergelson and Richter on ergodic averages along the number of prime factors of integers. In this paper, we will show the analogue of these results for co-prime integer pairs. Moreover, building on Frantzikinakis and Host's results, we obtain some convergences on the multilinear averages of multiplicative functions over primitive lattice points.</p></details>

> **Comment:** completely updated by adding infinite families of congruences for $c$-elongated plane partitions; 7 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an integer $c\geq 1$, let $a_c(n)$ count the number of generalized cubic partitions of $n$, which are partitions of $n$ whose even parts may appear in $c$ different colors, and $d_c(n)$ count the number of partitions obtained by adding the links of the $c$-elongated plane partition diamonds of length $n$. We prove in this note infinite families of congruences modulo $7$ and $11$ for $a_c(n)$ and $d_c(n)$ by employing elementary $q$-series techniques. These results generalize particular congruences modulo $7$ and $11$ for $a_c(n)$ and $d_c(n)$ recently found by Dockery, and Baruah, Das, and Talukdar, respectively, using modular forms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G_1, \dots, G_k$ be finite-dimensional vector spaces over a prime field $\mathbb{F}_p$. Let $V$ be a variety inside $G_1 \times \cdots \times G_k$ defined by a multilinear map. We show that if $|V| \geq c |G_1| \cdots |G_k|$, then $V$ contains a subvariety defined by at most $K(\log_{p} c^{-1} + 1)$ multilinear forms, where $K$ depends on $k$ only. This result is optimal up to multiplicative constant and is relevant to the partition vs. analytic rank problem in additive combinatorics.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the first part of the paper, we fix a non-CM elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ and an odd prime $\ell$ and investigate the distribution of invariants associated to the $\ell$-volcano containing the reduction $E_p$, as $p$ ranges over primes of good ordinary reduction. Let $H(p)$ be the height of the volcano and let $d'(p)$ denote the relative position of $j(E_p)$ above the floor, and let $r\ge 0$ be an integer. Assuming that the $\ell$-adic Galois representation attached to $E$ is surjective, we derive an explicit formula for the natural density of primes $p$ for which $H(p)=r$ (resp.\ $d'(p)=r$). In the non-surjective case, we show that all sufficiently large heights occur with positive density. In the second part of the paper, we analyze the distribution of $\ell$-volcano heights over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ and consider the limit as $q\to\infty$. Using analytic estimates for sums of Hurwitz class numbers in arithmetic progressions, we compute exact limiting densities for ordinary elliptic curves whose $\ell$-isogeny graph has a prescribed height $r$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The homology of free Lie algebras with coefficients in tensor products of the adjoint representation working over Q contains important information on the homological properties of polynomial outer functors on free groups. The latter category was introduced in joint work with Vespa, motivated by the study of higher Hochschild homology of wedges of circles. There is a splitting of this homology by polynomial degree (for polynomiality with respect to the generators of the free Lie algebra) and one can consider the polynomial degree relative to the number of tensor factors in the coefficients. It suffices to consider the Lie algebra homology in homological degree one; this vanishes in relative degree 0 and is readily calculated in relative degree 1. This paper calculates the homology in relative degree 2, which presents interesting features. This confirms a conjecture of Gadish and Hainaut.</p></details>
