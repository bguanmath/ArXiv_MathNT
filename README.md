<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>$\widehat{Z}$ invariants, rigorously defined for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds, are expected--on physical grounds--to exist for every closed, oriented 3-manifold. Several prescriptions have been proposed to extend their definition to generic plumbings by reversing the orientation of a negative definite plumbing, thus turning it into a positive definite one. Two existing proposals are relevant for this paper: (i) the regularized $+1/r$-surgery conjecture combined with the false-mock modular conjecture, and (ii) a construction based on resurgence and a false theta function duality. In this note, we compare these proposals on the class of Brieskorn homology spheres $\Sigma\left(s,t,rst\pm1\right)$ and find that they are incompatible in general. Our diagnostic is the effective central charge, $c_{\text{eff}}$, which governs the asymptotic growth of coefficients of $\widehat{Z}$. First, we prove that the upper bound on $c_{\text{eff}}$ from prescription (i) is governed by the Ramanujan theta function, which regularizes the surgery formula. Second, we develop numerical and modular tools that deliver the lower bounds as well as exact values via mixed mock-modular analysis. Complementing this, we also study $c_{\text{eff}}$ for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds which allow for a better comparison of pairs of 3-manifolds related by orientation reversal. As a result, we find that for some Brieskorn spheres the surgery and false-mock prescriptions violate the expected relation between $c_{\text{eff}}$, Chern-Simons invariants and non-abelian flat connections. These findings underscore $\widehat{Z}$ as a sensitive probe of the "positive side" of $\widehat{Z}$-theory.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Radu Balan, Efstratios Tsoukanis &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Consider a finite dimensional real vector space and a finite group acting unitarily on it. We study the general problem of constructing Euclidean stable embeddings of the quotient space of orbits. Our embedding is based on subsets of sorted coorbits. Our main result shows that, whenever such embeddings are injective, they are automatically bi-Lipschitz. Additionally, we demonstrate that stable embeddings can be achieved with reduced dimensionality, and that any continuous or Lipschitz $G$-invariant map can be factorized through these embeddings.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 57 pages; all comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We revisit the classical constructions of tensor-triangular geometry in the setting of stably symmetric monoidal idempotent-complete $\infty$-categories, henceforth referred to as 2-rings. In this setting, we produce a Zariski topology, a Zariski spectrum, a category of locally 2-ringed spaces (more generally $\infty$-topoi), and an affine spectrum-global sections adjunction, based on the framework of ``$\infty$-topoi with geometric structure'' as developed by Lurie in \cite{LurieDAG5}. Using work of Kock and Pitsch, we compute that the underlying space of the Zariski spectrum of a 2-ring recovers the Balmer spectrum of its homotopy category. These constructions mirror the analogous structures in the classical Zariski geometry of commutative rings (and commutative ring spectra), and we also demonstrate additional compatibility between classical Zariski and higher Zariski geometry. For rigid 2-rings, we show that the descent results of Balmer and Favi admit coherent enhancements. As a corollary, we obtain that the Zariski spectrum fully faithfully embeds rigid 2-rings into locally 2-ringed $\infty$-topoi. In an appendix, we prove a ``stalk-locality principle'' for the telescope conjecture in the rigid setting, extending earlier work of Hrbek.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a simple geometric characterization of the locus where the inscribed Banach--Colmez Tangent Spaces of moduli of mixed characteristic local shtukas with one leg and fixed determinant are connected. We conjecture that the structure morphism for the underlying diamond is cohomologically smooth over this locus and, applying the Fargues--Scholze Jacobian criterion, we prove this conjecture in the case of EL infinite level Rapoport--Zink spaces, generalizing a result of Ivanov--Weinstein in the basic case.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11589v1'>2508.11589</a>\]&nbsp; **Inscription, twistors, and $p$-adic periods**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sean Howe &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 77 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the theory of inscribed $v$-sheaves, a differentiable extension of the theory of diamonds and $v$-sheaves with internal tangent bundles that are often relative inscribed Banach-Colmez spaces, then apply this theory to the study of $p$-adic periods. In particular, we construct natural inscribed versions of the Hodge and Hodge-Tate period maps and their lattice refinements for de Rham torsors, then compute the derivatives of these period maps in terms of classical structures in $p$-adic Hodge theory. These torsors include infinite level global Shimura varieties and infinite level local Shimura varieties, and for these spaces we also give another moduli-theoretic construction of the inscribed structure; the construction in the local Shimura case applies more generally to the non-minuscule moduli of mixed characterisic local shtukas with one leg. The key new ingredients in our study of inscribed structures on $p$-adic Lie group torsors over smooth rigid varieties over a $p$-adic field are the Liu-Zhu period map, a refinement of the Hodge period map whose derivative is the geometric Sen morphism/canonical Higgs field, and a closely related exact tensor functor from $\mathbb{Q}_p$-local systems to a category of twistor bundles on the relative thickened Fargues-Fontaine curve. These new structures are only visible after passing to the inscribed setting. We also discuss some possible implications of our computations in the vein of ``differential topology for diamonds."</p></details>

The third finding is that we study the irreducibility of the homogeneous local representations of $SB_n$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Claude Cibils, Marcelo Lanzilotta, Eduardo N. Marcos, Andrea Solotar &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 14 pages Some minor changes. The statement and proof of Proposition 3.8 have been adjusted

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we introduce, according to one of the main ideas of $\tau$-tilting theory, the $\tau$-Hochschild cohomology in degree one of a finite dimensional $k$-algebra $\Lambda$, where $k$ is a field. We define the excess of $\Lambda$ as the difference between the dimensions of the $\tau$-Hochschild cohomology in degree one and the dimension of the usual Hochschild cohomology in degree one. One of the main results is that for a zero excess bound quiver algebra $\Lambda=kQ/I$, the Hochschild cohomology in degree two $\mathsf{HH}^2(\Lambda) $ is isomorphic to the space of morphisms $\mathsf{Hom}_{kQ-kQ}(I/I^2, \Lambda).$ This is useful to determine when $\mathsf{HH}^2(\Lambda)=0$ for these algebras. We compute the excess for hereditary, radical square zero and monomial triangular algebras. For a bound quiver algebra $\Lambda$, a formula for the excess of $\Lambda$ is obtained. We also give a criterion for $\Lambda$ to be $\tau$-rigid.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Netan Dogra &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Chabauty--Coleman--Kim method in depth two describes the rational points on a curve in terms of a generalisation of Nekov\'a\v{r}'s $p$-adic height pairing which replaces $\mathbb{G}_m$ with a higher Chow group. It is unclear both what the domain of definition of this pairing is, and how to compute it. This paper explores the relevance of the Beilinson--Bloch conjectures to this problem. In particular, it is shown that if $X$ is a smooth projective curve and the Albanese kernel of $X\times X$ is torsion, then there is an algorithm to compute the generalised height pairing on a pair of rational points on the Jacobian. This leads to the consideration of certain `motivic refinements' of the nonabelian cohomology varieties which arise in nonabelian Chabauty.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Chi Hoi Yip &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 11 pages, revised based on referee comments

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $q$ be an odd power of a prime $p$, and $S \subset \mathbb{F}_q^*$ such that $S=-S$ and $S/S \neq \mathbb{F}_q^*$. We show that the clique number of the Cayley graph $\mathrm{Cay}(\mathbb{F}_q^+,S)$ is at most $\sqrt{|S/S|}+\sqrt{q/p}$, improving the best-known $\sqrt{q}$ upper bound for many families of such graphs substantially. Such a new bound is strongest for cyclotomic graphs and in particular, it implies the first nontrivial upper bound on the clique number of all generalized Paley graphs of non-square order, extending the work of Hanson and Pertidis. Moreover, our new bound is asymptotically sharp for an infinite family of generalized Paley graphs, and we further discover the first nontrivial family among them for which the clique number can be exactly determined. We also obtain a new lower bound on the number of directions determined by a large Cartesian product in the affine Galois plane $AG(2,q)$, which is sharp for infinite families.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Shubham Jaiswal &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 28 pages. Significant changes made. New sections and new results added in v2. Changed the title

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We carry forward the work started by the author and Bhagwat in [2] and develop the Theory of root clusters further in this article and also apply similar methods to resolve certain problems in related areas. We establish the Inverse root capacity problem for number fields which is a generalization of Inverse cluster size problem for number fields proved in [2]. We introduce the concept of intersection indicium as a generalization of the concept of ascending index introduced in [2] and prove some of its properties. We then establish the Inverse intersection indicium problem for number fields (excluding certain cases) which is a generalization of Inverse ascending index problem for number fields proved in [2]. We give a field theoretic formulation for the concept of minimal generating sets of splitting fields which was introduced by the author and Vanchinathan in [10] and generalize a result in [10] for number fields and also establish the existence of field extensions over number fields for given degree and given cardinality of minimal generating set of Galois closure dividing the degree. We generalize a result in [6] by establishing that a certain family of triplets is compositum feasible over any number field and we also list all the irreducible triplets in this family. We also prove a partial case of a conjecture in [6]. In the concluding section of this article, we improve on the inverse problems proved in [2] and this article by proving that there exist arbitrarily large finite families of pairwise non-isomorphic extensions having additional properties that satisfy the given conditions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Faruk Alpay, Taylan Alpay &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 9 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A single closed expression $f_{\text{Alpay},U}(x)$ is presented which, for every integer $x\ge 0$, returns the $(x+1)$-th prime $p_{x+1}$. The construction uses only integer arithmetic, greatest common divisors, and floor functions. A prime indicator $I(j)$ is encoded through a short $\gcd$-sum; a cumulative counter $S(i)=\sum_{j\le i}I(j)$ equals $\pi(i)$; and a folded step $A(i,x)$ counts precisely up to the next prime index without piecewise branching. A corollary shows that for any fixed integer $L\ge 2$, the integer $P^\star=f_{\text{Alpay},U}(L)$ is prime and $P^\star>L$. Two explicit schedules $U(x)$ are given: a square schedule $U_{\text{sq}}(x)=(x+1)^2$ and a near-linear schedule $U_{\text{Alpay-lin}}(x)=\Theta(x\log x)$ justified by explicit bounds on $p_n$. We include non-synonymy certificates relative to Willans-type enumerators (schedule and operator-signature separation) and prove an asymptotic minimality bound: any forward-count enumerator requires $U(x)=\Omega(x\log x)$ while $U_{\text{Alpay-lin}}$ achieves $O(x\log x)$. We also provide explicit operation counts (''form complexity'') of the folded expression.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\Gamma$ be a cofinite Fuchsian subgroup. The canonical Green's function associated with $\Gamma$ arises in Arakelov theory when establishing asymptotics for Arakelov invariants of the modular curve associated with some congruence subgroup of level $N$ with a positive integer $N$. More precisely, in the known cases, canonical Green's functions at certain cusps contribute to the analytic part of the asymptotics for the self-intersection of the relative dualizing sheaf. In this article, we prove canonical Green's function of a cofinite Fuchsian subgroup at cusps bounded by the scattering constants, the Kronecker limit functions, and the Selberg zeta function of the group $\Gamma$. Then as an application, we prove an asymptotic expression of the canonical Green's function associated with $\Gamma_0(N)$, for any positive integer $N$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Substantial revision of previous versions, give a more conceptual proof of Mazur's conjecture on higher Heegner points and change the title

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a point $x_0$ in a Shimura variety attached to a Shimura datum of Hodge type $(G,X)$, we have an associated abelian scheme $A_0$. Fixing a non-empty finite set $\mathcal{S}$ of primes, we consider the simultaneous supersingular reduction modulo $\ell\in\mathcal{S}$ of (several copies of) $p$-adic Hecke orbits of $A_0$. We give a precise description of the image of this map. As an application, we give a more conceptual proof of Mazur's conjecture on non-torsionness of higher Heegner points on an abelian variety which is a quotient of the Jacobian of a Shimura curve. Our arguments simplify those of C.Cornut and V.Vatsal in two important aspects: (1) we do not need to assume the $p$-adic group $G^1(\mathbb{Q}_p)/Z_{G^1(\mathbb{Q}_p)}$ to be simple; (2) we do not need to consider separately the ``geometric" part and ``chaotic" part in the Hecke orbits.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using a geometric argument building on our new theory of graded sheaves, we compute the categorical trace and Drinfel'd center of the (graded) finite Hecke category $\mathsf{H}_W^\mathsf{gr} = \mathsf{Ch}^b(\mathsf{SBim}_W)$ in terms of the category of (graded) unipotent character sheaves, upgrading results of Ben-Zvi-Nadler and Bezrukavninov-Finkelberg-Ostrik. In type $A$, we relate the categorical trace to the category of $2$-periodic coherent sheaves on the Hilbert schemes $\mathsf{Hilb}_n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$ (equivariant with respect to the natural $\mathbb{C}^* \times \mathbb{C}^*$ action), yielding a proof of (a $2$-periodized version of) a conjecture of Gorsky-Negut-Rasmussen which relates HOMFLY-PT link homology and the spaces of global sections of certain coherent sheaves on $\mathsf{Hilb}_n(\mathbb{C}^2)$. As an important computational input, we also establish a conjecture of Gorsky-Hogancamp-Wedrich on the formality of the Hochschild homology of $\mathsf{H}_W^\mathsf{gr}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the relationship between almost mathematics, condensed mathematics and the categories of seminormed and Banach modules over a Banach ring $A$, with submetric (norm-decreasing) $A$-module homomorphisms for morphisms. If $A$ is a Banach ring with a norm-multiplicative topologically nilpotent unit $\varpi$ contained in the closed unit ball $A_{\leq1}$ such that $\varpi$ admits a compatible system of $p$-power roots $\varpi^{1/p^{n}}$ with \begin{equation*}\lVert\varpi^{1/p^{n}}\rVert=\lVert\varpi\rVert^{1/p^{n}}\end{equation*}for all $n$, we prove that the "almost closed unit ball" functor \begin{equation*}M\mapsto M_{\leq1}^{a}\end{equation*}is an equivalence between the category of Banach $A$-modules and submetric $A$-module maps and the category of $\varpi$-adically complete, $\varpi$-torsion-free almost $(A_{\leq1}, (\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-modules. We also obtain an analogous result for Banach algebras and almost algebras. The main novelty in our approach is that we show that the norm on the Banach module $M$ is completely determined by the corresponding almost $A_{\leq1}$-module $M_{\leq1}^{a}$, rather than being determined only up to equivalence. We deduce from our results the existence of a natural fully faithful embedding of the category of Banach $A$-modules and submetric $A$-module maps into the category of (static) condensed almost $(A_{\leq1}, (\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-modules in the sense of Mann, which factors through the full subcategory of solid condensed $(A_{\leq1}, (\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-almost modules. If $A$ is perfectoid and the adic spectrum of $(A, A^{\circ})$ is totally disconnected, we show that this embedding transforms the complete tensor product of Banach $A$-modules into (an almost analog of) the solid tensor product of solid condensed almost modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The local converse theorem for Rankin-Selberg gamma factors of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ proved by Piatetski-Shapiro over $\mathbb{C}$ no longer holds after reduction modulo $\ell \neq p$. To remedy this, we construct new $\mathrm{GL}_n \times \mathrm{GL}_m$ gamma factors valued in arbitrary $\mathbb{Z}[1/p, \zeta_p]$-algebras for Whittaker-type representations, show that they satisfy a functional equation, and then prove a $\mathrm{GL}_n \times \mathrm{GL}_{n-1}$ converse theorem for irreducible cuspidal representations. In the $\mathrm{GL}_2 \times \mathrm{GL}_1$ case, we define an alternative "new" gamma factor, which takes values in $k$ and satisfies a converse theorem that matches the converse theorem in characteristic $0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By a result of Serre, if $A$ is an elliptic curve without CM defined over a number field $L$, then the set of primes of $L$ for which $A$ has ordinary reduction has density $1$. Katz and Ogus proved the same is true when $A$ is an abelian surface, after possibly passing to a finite extension of $L$. More recently, Sawin computed the density of the set of primes of $L$ for which an abelian surface $A$ has ordinary reduction, depending on the endomorphism algebra of $A$. In this paper, we prove some generalizations of these results when $A$ is an absolutely simple abelian variety of arbitrary dimension whose endomorphism algebra is a CM field $F$, under specific conditions on the signature of the multiplication action of $F$ on $A$. We include explicit examples from Jacobians of curves of genus three through seven admitting cyclic covers to the projective line.</p></details>

Motivated by the classical "one class in each genus problem", we prove general finiteness theorems for the number fields $K$ with a fixed P\'olya index $\left[{\rm Cl}(K):{\rm Po}(K)\right]$ in the families of Galois number fields, solvable CM-fields, and real quadratic fields of extended R-D type. We also give classification results for specific families. Most notably, we classify, unconditionally, all imaginary bi-quadratic and imaginary tri-quadratic fields with the P\'olya index one. Furthermore, we classify all real quadratic fields of extended R-D type (with possibly only one more field) with the P\'olya index one. Also, under GRH, we give the complete list of 161 imaginary quadratic fields with the P\'olya index two. Finally, as a byproduct of our results, we extend, from narrow R-D types to the extended R-D types, Dohmae's classification of real quadratic fields of narrow R-D type whose narrow genus numbers equal their narrow class numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We apply the calculus of variations to construct a new sequence of linear combinations of derivatives of the Riemann $\zeta$-function adapted to Levinson's method, which yield a positive proportion of zeros of the $\zeta$-function on the critical line, regardless of how short the mollifier is. Our construction extends readily to modular $L$-functions. Even with Levinson's original choice of mollifier, our method more than doubles the proportions of zeros on the critical line for modular $L$-functions previously obtained by Bernard and K\"uhn--Robles--Zeindler, while relying on the same arithmetic inputs. This indicates that optimizing the linear combinations, an approach that has received relatively little attention, has a more pronounced effect than refining the mollifier when it is short. Curiously, our linear combinations provide non-trivial smooth approximations of Siegel's $\mathfrak{f}$-function in the celebrated Riemann--Siegel formula.</p></details>

After discussing this notion in general we consider it for the Euler numbers, the Bernoulli denominators, and the Bernoulli numerators. This gives, for example, a dynamical characterization of the Bernoulli regular primes. Algebraic realizability of the Bernoulli denominators is shown at every prime, giving a different perspective on the great diversity of congruences satisfied by this sequence. We show that the sequence of Euler numbers cannot be realized on a nilpotent group, which may explain why it is less hospitable to congruence hunting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Residue number systems based on pairwise relatively prime moduli are a powerful tool for accelerating integer computations via the Chinese Remainder Theorem. We study a structured family of moduli of the form $2^n - 2^k + 1$, originally proposed for their efficient arithmetic and bit-level properties. These trinomial moduli support fast modular operations and exhibit scalable modular inverses. We investigate the problem of constructing large sets of pairwise relatively prime trinomial moduli of fixed bit length. By analyzing the corresponding trinomials $x^n - x^k + 1$, we establish a sufficient condition for coprimality based on polynomial resultants. This leads to a graph-theoretic model where maximal sets correspond to cliques in a compatibility graph, and we use maximum clique-finding algorithms to construct large examples in practice. Using the theory of graph colorings, resultants, and properties of cyclotomic polynomials, we also prove upper bounds on the size of such sets as a function of $n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $C$ be a genus $2$ curve over $\mathbb{Q}$. Harvey and Sutherland's implementation of Harvey's average polynomial-time algorithm computes the $\bmod \ p$ reduction of the numerator of the zeta function of $C$ at all good primes $p\leq B$ in $O(B\log^{3+o(1)}B)$ time, which is $O(\log^{4+o(1)} p)$ time on average per prime. Alternatively, their algorithm can do this for a single good prime $p$ in $O(p^{1/2}\log^{1+o(1)}p)$ time. While Harvey's algorithm can also be used to compute the full zeta function, no practical implementation of this step currently exists. In this article, we present an $O(\log^{2+o(1)}p)$ Las Vegas algorithm that takes the $\bmod \ p$ output of Harvey and Sutherland's implementation and outputs the full zeta function. We then benchmark our results against the fastest algorithms currently available for computing the full zeta function of a genus~$2$ curve, finding substantial speedups in both the average polynomial-time and single prime settings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For integral weights $\lambda$ and $\mu$ of a classical simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, Kostant's weight multiplicity formula gives the multiplicity of the weight $\mu$ in the irreducible representation with highest weight $\lambda$, which we denote by $m(\lambda,\mu)$. Kostant's weight multiplicity formula is an alternating sum over the Weyl group of the Lie algebra whose terms are determined via a vector partition function. The Weyl alternation set $\mathcal{A}(\lambda,\mu)$ is the set of elements of the Weyl group that contribute nontrivially to the multiplicity $m(\lambda,\mu)$. In this article, we prove that Weyl alternation sets are order ideals in the weak Bruhat order of the corresponding Weyl group. Specializing to the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_{r+1}(\mathbb{C})$, we give a complete characterization of the Weyl alternation sets $\mathcal{A}(\tilde{\alpha},\mu)$, where $\tilde{\alpha}$ is the highest root and $\mu$ is a negative root, answering a question of Harry posed in 2024. We also provide some enumerative results that pave the way for our future work, where we aim to prove Harry's conjecture that the $q$-analog of Kostant's weight multiplicity formula is $m_q(\tilde{\alpha},\mu)=q^{r+j-i+1}+q^{r+j-i}-q^{j-i+1}$ when $\mu=-(\alpha_i+\alpha_{i+1}+\cdots+\alpha_{j})$ is a negative root of $\mathfrak{sl}_{r+1}(\mathbb{C})$.</p></details>

Specifically, we give a partial classification of the validity of the Hasse norm principle for $K/k$ in the case where (1) $[K:k]=p\ell$ where $p$ and $\ell$ are two distinct prime numbers; or (2) $[K:k]=4p$ where $p$ is an odd prime.

Furthermore, we prove that there exist infinitely many separable extensions of square-free degree for which the exponents of the obstruction groups to the Hasse norm principle are not prime powers.</p></details>

Suppose $X$ is equipped with a $p$-adic \'{e}tale local system compatible with an admissible graded-polarized variation of mixed Hodge structures on the complex analytification of $X_{\mathbb{C}}$. We prove that the $S$-integral points in $X$ are covered by subpolynomially many geometrically irreducible $K$-subvarieties, each lying in a fiber of the mixed period mapping arising from the variation of mixed Hodge structures. This is based on recent works by Brunebarbe-Maculan and Ellenberg-Lawrence-Venkatesh.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct local models for wildly ramified unitary similitude groups of odd dimension $n\geq 3$ with special parahoric level structure and signature $(n-1,1)$. We first give a lattice-theoretic description for parahoric subgroups using Bruhat-Tits theory in residue characteristic two, and apply them to define local models following the lead of Rapoport-Zink and Pappas-Rapoport. In our case, there are two conjugacy classes of special parahoric subgroups. We show that the local models are smooth for the one class and normal, Cohen-Macaulay for the other class. We also prove that they represent the v-sheaf local models of Scholze-Weinstein. Under some additional assumptions, we obtain an explicit moduli interpretation of the local models.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cases of Shimura varieties where the special fibre of a Rapoport-Zink space is simply the union of classical Deligne-Lusztig varieties are known as fully Hodge-Newton decomposable ones, and have been studied with great interest in the past. In recent times, the focus has shifted to identify tractable cases beyond the fully Hodge-Newton decomposable ones, and several instances have been identified where only products of classical Deligne-Lusztig varities with simpler spaces occur. In our paper, we provide a uniform framework to capture these phenomena. By studying liftings from the affine flag variety to the loop group and combining them with the Deligne-Lusztig reduction method, our main result is a powerful criterion to show that an affine Deligne-Lusztig variety is the product of a classical Deligne-Lusztig variety with affine spaces and pointed affine spaces. We introduce the class of elements that we call having geometric Coxeter type, strictly including previously studied notions such as positive Coxeter type or finite Coxeter type. These elements of geometric Coxeter type satisfy the conditions for our main result and also a condition on the Newton stratification introduced by Mili\'cevi\'c-Viehmann.</p></details>

We also classify orthogonal Euler pairs in simple Lie algebras and determine the fundamental groups of adjoint Euler elements in arbitrary finite-dimensional Lie algebras. Causal complements of wedge regions in spacetimes can be related to so-called twisted complements in the space of abstract Euler wedges, defined in purely group theoretic terms.

> **Comment:** Simplified the main argument in Section 5

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There are two longstanding conjectures on the centers of the cyclotomic Hecke algebra $\mathscr{H}_{n,K}^\Lambda$ of type $G(r,1,n)$ which assert that: 1) the dimension of the center $Z(\mathscr{H}_{n,K}^\Lambda)$ is independent of the characteristic of the ground field $K$, its Hecke parameter and cyclotomic parameters; 2) the center $Z(\mathscr{H}_{n,K}^\Lambda)$ of $\mathscr{H}_{n,K}^\Lambda$ is the set of symmetric polynomials in its Jucys-Murphy operators. In this paper we prove these two conjectures affirmatively. At the same time we show that the center conjecture holds for the cyclotomic KLR algebras $\mathscr{R}_{\alpha,K}^\Lambda$ associated to the cyclic quiver $A_{e-1}^{(1)}$ (for $e>1$) and the linear quiver $A_{\infty}$ (for $e=0$) when the ground field $K$ has characteristic $p$ which satisfies either $p=0$, or $p>0=e$, or $p=e>1$, or $p>0$, $e>1$ and $p$ is coprime to $e$. As applications, we show that the cohomology of the Nakajima quiver variety $\mathfrak{M}(\Lambda,\alpha)$ with coefficient in $K$ is isomorphic to the center of $\mathscr{R}_{\alpha,K}^\Lambda$ in the affine type $A$ case when ${\rm{char}} K=0$; we also verify Chavli-Pfeiffer's conjecture on the polynomial coefficient $g_{w,C}$ for the complex reflection group of type $G(r,1,n)$.</p></details>

In the case of surfaces, we provide precise spectral asymptotics expansion (up to arbitrary polynomial power) for the eigenvalues of this map. Moreover, we consider the inverse spectral problem and from the expansion we show that the spectrum of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, in favourable situations, uniquely determines the number and the length of boundary components, the parallel transport and the magnetic flux along boundary components. In general, we show that the situation complicates compared to the case when there is no magnetic field. For instance, there are plenty of examples where the expansion does $\textit{not}$ detect the number of boundary components, and this phenomenon is thoroughly studied in the paper.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 92 pages, 17 figures. v2: corrected misclassified shifted Charlier specialization; added results on Stieltjes moment sequences; reorganized the paper into three parts for clearer exposition

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study positivity and probabilistic properties arising from the Young--Fibonacci lattice $\mathbb{YF}$, a 1-differential poset on binary (Fibonacci) words of 1's and 2's, graded by digit sum. Building on Okada's theory of clone Schur functions (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 346 (1994), 549--568), we define clone coherent measures on $\mathbb{YF}$ that generate random Fibonacci words of increasing length; unlike for the Young lattice (powered by the classical Schur functions), clone coherent measures are generally not extremal on $\mathbb{YF}$. Our first main result is a complete characterization of Fibonacci positive specializations -- parameter sequences which yield positive clone Schur functions on $\mathbb{YF}$. Second, we connect Fibonacci positivity with: (i) total positivity of tridiagonal matrices; (ii) Stieltjes moment sequences; (iii) the combinatorics of set partitions; and (iv) families of univariate orthogonal polynomials from the (q-)Askey scheme. We further link moment sequences of orthogonal polynomials to combinatorial structures on Fibonacci words, a connection that may be of independent interest. Third, we analyze scaling limits of the induced random words, obtaining stick-breaking-type limits (linked to GEM laws), new dependent stick-breaking limits, and limits supported on the discrete part of the Martin boundary of $\mathbb{YF}$. These results significantly extend the asymptotics of the Plancherel measure on $\mathbb{YF}$ proved by Gnedin--Kerov (Math. Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc. 129 (2000), 433--446). Finally, we prove Cauchy-type identities for clone Schur functions with quadridiagonal-determinant right-hand side (in contrast to the product form for classical Schur functions), and construct models of random permutations and involutions from Fibonacci-positive specializations together with a Robinson--Schensted correspondence adapted to $\mathbb{YF}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define super-Cayley graphs over a finite abelian group $G$. Using the theory of supercharacters on $G$, we explain how their spectra can be realized as a super-Fourier transform of a superclass characteristic function. Consequently, we show that a super-Cayley graph is determined by its spectrum once an indexing on the underlying group $G$ is fixed. This generalizes a theorem by Sander-Sander, which investigates the case where $G$ is a cyclic group. We then use our theory to define and study the concept of a $U$-unitary Cayley graph over a finite commutative ring $R$, where $U$ is a subgroup of the unit group of $R$. Furthermore, when the underlying ring is a Frobenius ring, we show that there is a natural supercharacter theory associated with $U$. By applying the general theory of super-Cayley graphs developed in the first part, we explore various spectral properties of these $U$-unitary Cayley graphs, including their rationality and connections to various arithmetical sums.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Some updates, several references added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider representations of quivers taking values in monads or comonads over a Grothendieck category $\mathcal C$. We treat these as scheme like objects whose ``structure sheaf'' consists of monads or comonads. By using systems of adjoint functors between Eilenberg-Moore categories, we obtain a categorical framework of modules over monad quivers, and of comodules over comonad quivers. Our main objective is to give conditions for these to be Grothendieck categories, which play the role of noncommutative spaces. As with usual ringed spaces, we have to study two kinds of module categories over a monad quiver. The first behaves like a sheaf of modules over a ringed space. The second consists of modules that are cartesian, which resemble quasi-coherent sheaves. We also obtain an extension of the classical quasi-coherator construction to modules over a monad quiver with values in Eilenberg-Moore categories. We establish similar results for comodules over a comonad quiver. One of our key steps is finding a modulus like bound for an endofunctor $U:\mathcal C\longrightarrow \mathcal C$ in terms of $\kappa(G)$, where $G$ is a generator for $\mathcal C$ and $\kappa(G)$ is a cardinal such that $G$ is $\kappa(G)$-presentable. Another feature of our paper is that we study modules over a monad quiver in two different orientations, which we refer to as ``cis-modules'' and ``trans-modules.'' We conclude with rational pairings of a monad quiver with a comonad quiver, which relate comodules over a comonad quiver to coreflective subcategories of modules over monad quivers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the exceptional zero conjecture of Greenberg--Benois for $p$-ordinary regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{A})$ which are Steinberg at $p$. In particular, we obtain the first cases of this conjecture for non-essentially-self-dual RACARs of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{A})$. Our proof has two main parts. In Part 1, we use $p$-arithmetic cohomology to prove an exceptional zero formula using Gehrmann's automorphic $\mathcal{L}$-invariant. In Part 2 we prove the equality of automorphic and Fontaine--Mazur $\mathcal{L}$-invariants. As one of the key ingredients for this, we establish local-global compatibility at $\ell = p$ for Galois representations attached to $p$-ordinary torsion classes for $\mathrm{GL}_n$, confirming a conjecture of Hansen in this setting.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be an algebraic number field and $H$ the absolute Weil height. Write $c_K$ for a certain positive constant that is an invariant of $K$. We consider the question: does $K$ contain an algebraic integer $\alpha$ such that both $K = \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ and $H(\alpha) \le c_K$? If $K$ has a real embedding then a positive answer was established in previous work. Here we obtain a positive answer if $\textrm{Tor}\bigl(K^{\times}\bigr) \not= \{\pm 1\}$, and so $K$ has only complex embeddings. We also show that if the answer is negative, then $K$ is totally complex, $\textrm{Tor}\bigl(K^{\times}\bigr) = \{\pm 1\}$, and $K$ is a Galois extension of its maximal totally real subfield. Further, we show that if $\mu \in O_K$ is not totally real, then there exists $\alpha$ in $O_K$ with $K = \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ and $H(\alpha) \le H(\mu)\thinspace c_K$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer $x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$ for $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps $x\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In particular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$. This seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the conjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any correspondence between polynomials and positive integers. In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend their domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that correspond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power series. We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\colon F_2[[q]]\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$ otherwise, where $A,B\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some of these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive integers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that $T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the orbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two fixed points. Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these conjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by replacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic integer. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could settle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for both $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $n \times n$ random integer matrices $M_1,\ldots,M_k$, the cokernels of the partial products $\mathrm{cok}(M_1 \cdots M_i), 1 \leq i \leq k$ naturally define a random flag of abelian $p$-groups. We prove that as $n \to \infty$, this flag converges universally, for any nondegenerate entry distribution, to the Cohen-Lenstra type measure which weights each flag inversely proportional to the size of its automorphism group. As a corollary, we prove universality of certain formulas for the limiting conditional distribution of $\mathrm{cok}(M_1M_2)$ given $\mathrm{cok}(M_1),\mathrm{cok}(M_2)$ in terms of Hall-Littlewood structure constants, which were previously obtained only for Haar matrices over $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Our proofs combine the general technology of Sawin-Wood, matrix product moment computations following those of Nguyen-Van Peski, and the computation done previously for Haar $p$-adic matrices by Huang.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We say that an abelian variety $A_{/{\mathbb Q}}$ of dimension $g$ is prosaic if it is semistable, with good reduction at 2 and its points of order $2$ generate a $2$-extension of ${\mathbb Q}$. We show that if $B$ is prosaic and simple, then there is an isogenous abelian variety $A$ for which End $A$ is the ring of integers $\mathfrak{o}$ in a number field $L$. The field $L$ is a totally real or CM field and all primes of $\mathfrak{o}$ over $2$ have residue degree $1$. For $p \equiv 1$ (mod 8), let $M_u$ be the maximal 2-primary unramified abelian extension of $K = {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{-p})$ and let $h_2 = [M_u:K]$. We construct an indecomposable group scheme $\Xi_p$ over ${\mathbb Z}[\frac{1}{p}]$ of exponent 2 with field of points $M_u$. Assume that $A$ is prosaic, with bad reduction at only one prime $p$. Then $p \equiv 1$ (mod 8) and $A$ is totally toroidal at $p$. We prove that if End $A={\mathbb Z}$, then there is a ${\mathbb Q}$-isogenous abelian variety $B$ such that $B[2]$ is a subquotient of $\Xi_p$. We thereby show that $2g+2 \le h_2$ and $p$ has the form $a^2+16b^2$, with $a+4b \equiv \pm 1$ (mod 8). Moreover, if $2g + 4 \le h_2$, then $p$ has the form $a^2+64b^2$, with $a \equiv \pm 1$ (mod 8).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a family of algebraic structures as a higher-dimensional generalization of vertex algebras, which we term cohomological vertex algebras. The formal punctured 1-disk underlying a vertex algebra is replaced by a ring modeling the cohomology of certain schemes such as the formal punctured $n$-disk and the formal 1-disk with doubled origin. The latter scheme leads to the raviolo vertex algebras of Garner & Williams. We prove several structural theorems for cohomological vertex algebras, as well as examine an appropriate Witt-like algebra and its central extensions, giving a definition of a cohomological vertex operator algebra. Using a reconstruction theorem for cohomological vertex algebras, we provide basic examples analogous to their vertex algebra counterparts.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We extend the classical Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt theorem to higher algebra by establishing a version that applies to spectral Lie algebras. We deduce this statement from a basic relation between operads in spectra: the commutative operad is the quotient of the associative operad by a right action of the spectral Lie operad. This statement, in turn, is a consequence of a fundamental relation between different $\mathbb{E}_n$-operads, which we articulate and prove. We deduce a variant of the Poincar\'{e}--Birkhoff--Witt theorem for relative enveloping algebras of $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras. Our methods also give a simple construction and description of the higher enveloping $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras of a spectral Lie algebra.</p></details>

In particular, no such zero exists if $\pi$ is non-dihedral and $\pi'$ is not a twist of $\pi$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We exhibit new examples of regions of $M\setminus L$ where $M$ and $L$ denote the Markov and Lagrange spectra, respectively. These regions have a different nature from all known regions studied so far: they contain \emph{intruder sets} associated with distinct combinatorics that trespass the region where self-replication holds. Our construction follows the usual self-replication method but replaces the standard local uniqueness condition with a more flexible and weaker property. These examples emerged from a large-scale computational search for regions of $M\setminus L$, which indicates that many such regions with intruder sets exist. We conclude with some open problems about these new regions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The enumeration $d_k(n)$ of $k$-elongated plane partition diamonds has emerged as a generalization of the classical integer partition function $p(n)$. Congruences for $d_k(n)$ modulo certain powers of primes have been proven via elementary means and modular forms by many authors. Recently, Banerjee and Smoot established an infinite family of congruences for $d_5(n)$ modulo powers of 5. In this paper we have discovered an infinite congruence family for $d_3(n)$ and $d_5(n)$ modulo powers of 7.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $n$ be a non-negative integer. Combining algebraic and combinatorial techniques, we investigate for which pairs $(G,\rho)$ of a subgroup $G$ of the symmetric group $S_n$ and an irreducible character $\rho$ of $G$ the induced character $\rho\!\uparrow^{S_n}$ is multiplicity-free. As a result, for $n\geq 66$, we classify all subgroups $G\leq S_n$ which give rise to such a pair. Moreover, for the majority of these groups $G$ we identify all the possible choices of the irreducible character $\rho$, assuming $n\geq 73$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a recursive algorithm for identifying all finite sequences of positive integers whose product equals their sum. Our method uses solutions of strictly shorter length that are iteratively extended in pursuit of a valid solution. The algorithm is efficient, with a time complexity similar to the quick sort algorithm.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the equidimensionality of affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties in mixed characteristic. This verifies a conjecture made by Rapoport and implies that the results of Nie and Zhou-Zhu can be extended to the whole irreducible components of affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties. The method is to translate the work of Hartl-Viehmann into mixed characteristic and construct local foliations for affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties. This leads us to develop a theory of formal algebraic geometry for perfect schemes.</p></details>
