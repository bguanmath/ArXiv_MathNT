 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Andrew Shallue, Jonathan Webster &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this note, we present progress on determining the computational complexity of tabulating all Carmichael numbers less than some bound $B$. We show that the query ``Is $n$ a Carmichael number?'' may be answered in polynomial time. We implemented a new tabulation algorithm which we describe here and found $308,279,939$ Carmichael numbers less than $10^{24}$. In lieu of providing an asymptotic analysis of that algorithm, we show a second related algorithm that we claim is optimal under a believable conjecture.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose an elementary tropical analogue of a reductive group that combines the datum of a Weyl group and the tropicalization of a fixed maximal torus. For the classical groups, as well as $G_2$, these tropical reductive groups admit descriptions as tropical matrix groups that resemble their classical counterparts. Employing this perspective, we introduce tropical principal bundles on metric graphs and study their explicit presentations as pushforwards of line bundles along covers with symmetries and extra data. Our main result identifies the essential skeleton of the moduli space of semistable principal bundles on a Tate curve with its tropical analogue.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zhaolin Li &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>According to the relative Langlands functoriality conjecture, an admissible morphism between the $L$-groups of spherical varieties should induce a functorial transfer of the corresponding local and global automorphic spectra. Via the relative trace formula approach, two basic problems are the fundamental lemma and the local transfer on the geometric side of the relative trace formulas. In this paper, we consider the rank-one spherical variety case, where the admissible morphism between the $L$-groups is the identity morphism, in which case, Y. Sakellaridis has already established the local transfer (\cite{Sak21}). We formulate the statement of the fundamental lemma for the general rank-one spherical variety case and prove the fundamental lemma for the rank-one spherical varieties of classical types.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 53 pages, 4 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>If $E$ is an elliptic curve, defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ or a number field having at least one real embedding, then Elkies proved that $E$ has supersingular reduction at infinitely many primes $p$. Baba and Granath extended this result to certain curves $C$ of genus $2$ with field of moduli $\mathbb{Q}$, under a condition on the endomorphism ring of the Jacobian. In this paper, we extend these results to certain curves of genus $4$ having an automorphism of order $5$, proving that the Jacobians of these curves have basic reduction (as defined by Kottwitz) for infinitely many primes $p$. To do this, we study the complex uniformization of the Deligne--Mostow Shimura variety $\mathrm{Sh}$ associated with the one dimensional family of these curves. By analyzing the real points on $\mathrm{Sh}$, we compute three geodesics in the upper half plane that are edges of a fundamental triangle for the action of the unitary similitude group. Using representations of quadratic forms, we determine the points on $\mathrm{Sh}$ which represent curves whose Jacobians have complex multiplication by certain quadratic extensions of the cyclotomic field $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_5)$. We conclude by studying the equidistribution of these points and the reduction of these CM cycles on the Shimura variety.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nicolae Ciprian Bonciocat &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 88 pages, 18 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>To study a Dirichlet polynomial $f(s)=\frac{a_{m}}{m^{s}}+\cdots +\frac{a_{n}}{n^{s}}$ by regarding it as a multivariate polynomial via the canonical map $\phi$ sending $p_i^{-s}$ to an indeterminate $X_i$, with $p_i$ the $i$th prime number, requires knowing the prime factorizations of all the integers in the support of $f$. We devise several methods to study the factorization of Dirichlet polynomials over unique factorization domains that circumvent the use of $\phi$, and obtain irreducibility criteria that are analogous to the classical results of Sch\"onemann, Eisenstein, Dumas, St\"ackel, Ore and Weisner for polynomials, and to more recent results of Filaseta and Cavachi. Some of the proofs rely on logarithmic versions of the classical Newton polygons. Criteria that use two or more $p$-adic valuations by combining information from different logarithmic Newton polygons of $f$, as well as irreducibility conditions for Dirichlet polynomials that assume a prime or a prime power value are also obtained. We also find excluding intervals for the relative degrees of the factors of a Dirichlet polynomial, and upper bounds for the multiplicities of the irreducible factors, in particular square-free criteria, that use no derivatives. Criteria of absolute irreducibility analogous to results of Ostrowski, Gao and Stepanov-Schmidt are finally provided in the multivariate case by using logarithmic Newton polytopes and logarithmic upper Newton polygons.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a randomised algorithm to compute the local zeta function of a fixed smooth, projective surface over $\mathbb{Q}$, at any large prime $p$ of good reduction.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yao Cheng &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 30 pages, Typos are fixed

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The conjectural theory of local newofmrs for the split $p$-adic group ${\rm SO}_{2n+1}$, proposed by Gross, predicts that the space of local newforms in a generic representation is one-dimensional. In this note, we prove that this space is at most one-dimensional and verify its expected arithmetic properties, conditional on existence. These results play an important role in our proof of the existence part of the newform conjecture.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22678v2'>2510.22678</a>\]&nbsp; **Abhyankar valuations, Prüfer-Manis valuations, and perfectoid Tate algebras**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Dimitri Dine, Jack J Garzella &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 50 pages, 3 figures, comments welcome. Corrected the statement and proof of Theorem 1.4 of the previous version, made corresponding changes to the main result

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a perfectoid field. We describe all quotient fields of the perfectoid Tate algebra\begin{equation*}T_{n,K}^{\text{perfd}}=K\langle X_{1}^{1/p^{\infty}},\dots, X_{n}^{1/p^{\infty}}\rangle\end{equation*}in any number $n\geq1$ of variables in terms of (completed perfections of) the nonarchimedean fields $K_{r_1,\dots,r_l}$ occuring in Berkovich geometry. We prove that every quotient field\begin{equation*}L=T_{n,K}^{\text{perfd}}/\mathfrak{m}\end{equation*}is a so-called \textit{semi-immediate} extension of $K_{r_1,\dots,r_l}^{\text{perfd}}$ for some\begin{equation*}l\leq\min(n-\text{ht}(\mathfrak{m}^{\flat}\cap (T_{n,K^{\flat}})^{\text{coperf}}),n-1), \end{equation*}which pins down the value groups and the residue fields of the possible quotient fields $L$. Moreover, we show that if\begin{equation*}\mathfrak{m}^{\flat}\cap(T_{n,K^{\flat}})^{\text{coperf}}\neq 0,\end{equation*} at least one of the radii $r_{i}$ has to be irrational, i.e.,\begin{equation*}r_{i}\not\in\sqrt{|K^{\times}|}.\end{equation*} The main ingredient in our proof is the notion of \textit{topologically simple} valuations, which generalize type (IV) points in the classification of points on $\text{Spa}(K\langle T\rangle)$ to the case of higher-dimensional polydisks. We also consider \textit{rational Abhyankar} valuations and \textit{irrational Abhyankar} valuations, which generalize type (II) and (III) points, respectively. We deduce our main result from a description of topologically simple absolute values and of Abhyankar absolute values on usual Tate algebra. Along the way, we also show that our topologically simple valuations are the same as Pr\"ufer-Manis valuations in the sense of Knebusch-Zhang. Finally, we also show that all allowed possibilities for the quotient fields $L$ do indeed occur (i.e., the above bound $l\leq n-1$ is optimal) by generalizing an example of Gleason.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to develop a group-theoretic algorithm, to reconstruct a number field (together with its maximal m-step solvable ex- tension for some positive integer m \geq 3) from the maximal m+9-step solv- able quotient of its absolute Galois group. If K is an imaginary quadratic field or Q, we establish a group-theoretic reconstruction algorithm of K from the maximal 6-step solvable quotient of its absolute Galois group.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Xavier Guitart, Santiago Molina &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** The definition of the periods has been adjusted to apply only in the lowest and highest cohomological degrees. No other substantial changes

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish several formulas relating periods of modular forms on quaternion algebras over number fields to special values of L-functions. Our main inputs are the cohomological techniques for working with periods introduced in [Mol21], along with explicit versions of the Waldspurger formula due to Cai-Shu-Tian. We work in general even positive weights; when specialized to parallel weight 2, our formulas provide partial evidence for the conjectures of Oda and of Prasanna-Venkatesh in the case of forms associated to elliptic curves.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by the representation theory of symplectic reflection algebras, deformed preprojective algebras, and graded Hecke algebras, we consider filtered algebras $U$ whose associated graded is Koszul. The Koszul dual of $U$, as defined by Positselski, is a curved dg-algebra. We establish an exact equivalence between the unbounded derived category of $U$ and an explicit quotient of the homotopy category of injective modules over the dual curved dg-algebra. This recovers a special case of a result of Positselski. In the case where $U$ has finite global dimension, the quotient is trivial and hence the unbounded derived category of $U$ is equivalent to the homotopy category of injective modules over the dual curved dg-algebra.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Karma Dajani, Cor Kraaikamp, Slade Sanderson &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DS &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 35 pages, 8 figures. Renumbering reflects published version. Mistake found after publication in Thm. 4.8; discussion and counterexample to appear in corrigendum in Math. Comp. Can be fixed by assuming $\bar\mu(\partial S)=0$ and $(0,0)\notin \bar{S}\cup\bar{R}$. Cor. 4.9, Thms. 5.2, 5.29 should also assume $(0,0)\notin\bar{R}$. Original applications are unaffected

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We revisit Ito's (\cite{I1989}) natural extension of the Farey tent map, which generates all regular continued fraction convergents and mediants of a given irrational. With a slight shift in perspective on the order in which these convergents and mediants arise, this natural extension is shown to provide an elegant and powerful tool in the metric theory of continued fractions. A wealth of old and new results -- including limiting distributions of approximation coefficients, analogues of a theorem of Legendre and their refinements, and a generalisation of L\'evy's Theorem to subsequences of convergents and mediants -- are presented as corollaries within this unifying theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Grothendieck defined a group that represents the local obstruction for an abelian variety to have semi-stable reduction. These groups were studied by Silverberg and Zarhin and more recently by the author in order to give a group theoretic characterization of them depending only on the dimension.

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10003v4'>2412.10003</a>\]&nbsp; **Parabolic restrictions and double deformations of weight multiplicities**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Cédric Lecouvey &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce some (p,q)-deformations of the weight multiplicities for the representations of any simple Lie algebra g over the complex numbers. This is done by associating the indeterminate q to the positive roots of a parabolic subsystem of g and the indeterminate p to the remaining positive roots. When p=q, we just recover the usual Lusztig analogues of weight multiplicities. We then study the positivity of the coefficients in these double deformations. In particular, the positivity holds when p=1 in which case the polynomials have a natural algebraic interpretation in terms of a parabolic Brylinski filtration. For the parabolic restriction from type C to type A, this positivity result was conjectured by Lee. We also establish this positivity, in any finite type and for any p, for a stabilized version of our double deformation. In addition, we study the double deformation obtained by replacing the pair (p,q) by (p+1,q+1), show it has nonnegative coefficients and admits a combinatorial description in terms of crystals.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-07 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Geoffrey Powell &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** v3 minor revision together with addition of an Appendix; 17 pages. (v2 Very minor revision. 14 pages.)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The homology of free Lie algebras with coefficients in tensor products of the adjoint representation working over Q contains important information on the homological properties of polynomial outer functors on free groups. The latter category was introduced in joint work with Vespa, motivated by the study of higher Hochschild homology of wedges of circles. There is a splitting of this homology by polynomial degree (for polynomiality with respect to the generators of the free Lie algebra) and one can consider the polynomial degree relative to the number of tensor factors in the coefficients. It suffices to consider the Lie algebra homology in homological degree one; this vanishes in relative degree 0 and is readily calculated in relative degree 1. This paper calculates the homology in relative degree 2, which presents interesting features. This confirms a conjecture of Gadish and Hainaut.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Expanded version: Added computation of the center of all multiplicity-free fusion categories up to rank 5 together with their F-symbols and R-symbols

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present an algorithm for explicitly computing the categorical (Drinfeld) center of a pivotal fusion category. Our approach is based on decomposing the images of simple objects under the induction functor from the category to its center. We have implemented this algorithm in a general-purpose software framework TensorCategories.jl for tensor categories that we develop within the open-source computer algebra system OSCAR. We compute explicit models for the centers in form of the tuples $(X,\gamma)$ where $X$ is an object and $\gamma$ is a half-braiding. From these models we can compute the $F$-symbols and $R$-symbols. Using the data from the AnyonWiki, we were able to compute the center together with its $F$-symbols and $R$-symbols for all the 279 multiplicity-free fusion categories up to rank 5, and furthermore some chosen examples of rank 6, including the Haagerup subfactor (presented in a separate paper).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce an analog of Gauss sums over function fields in positive characteristic. We establish several fundamental properties, including reflection formula, Stickelberger's theorem, and Hasse-Davenport relations. In addition, we determine their absolute values and signs at infinity. While these results parallel the classical theory of Gauss sums as well as Thakur's "arithmetic" analogs over function fields, our approach differs completely from both of the preceding cases. Specifically, we first prove a Gross-Koblitz-type formula relating geometric Gauss sums to special $v$-adic gamma values. The properties of geometric Gauss sums then follow from the specializations of this formula together with the functional equations of $v$-adic gamma functions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show, using the techniques developed in arXiv:2504.06444 and arXiv:2305.11139, that dagger algebras and Tate algebras in the sense of Berkovich in prime characteristic $p > 0$ have intersection flat Frobenius. Equivalently, if $S$ is such a ring, then $S^{1/p}$ is a flat and Mittag-Leffler $S$-module. As a consequence, we deduce that any ideal-adic completion of a reduced ring that is essentially of finite type over a dagger algebra or a Berkovich Tate algebra in prime characteristic has big test elements from tight closure theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 28 pages, 1 figure. Final version. Small typographical error corrected from previous version. To appear in the Journal of Number Theory

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\ell$ be prime, and $K$ be a number field containing the $\ell$-th roots of unity. We use classical algebraic number theory and some analytic techniques to prove that the Steinitz classes of $\mathbb Z/\ell\mathbb Z$ extensions of $K$ ordered by relative discriminant are equidistributed among realizable classes in the ideal class group of $K$. For $\ell = 2$, this was proved by Kable and Wright using the deep theory of prehomogeneous vector spaces. Foster proved that Steinitz classes are uniformly distributed between realizable classes for tamely ramified elementary-$m$ extensions using the theory of Galois modules; our approach eliminates this tameness hypothesis.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For fixed positive integers $n,m$, let $\mathrm{Mat}_{n\times m}(\mathbb{C})$ be the affine space consisting of all $n\times m$ complex matrices, and let $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n\times m}]$ be its coordinate ring. For $0\le r\le\min\{m,n\}$, we apply the orbit harmonics method to the finite matrix loci $\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r}$ of rook placements with exactly $r$ rooks, yielding a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n\times\mathfrak{S}_m$-module $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We find one signed and two sign-free graded character formulae for $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We also exhibit some applications of these formulae, such as proving a concise presentation of $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$, and proving some module injections and isomorphisms. Some of our techniques are still valid for involution matrix loci.</p></details>

Aizenbud, D. Gourevitch and S. Sahi. Furthermore, we prove the vanishing of higher extension groups for arbitrary pairs of generic representations, confirming a conjecture of Dipendra Prasad. We also utilize the Bernstein-Zelevinsky theory to establish two additional results: the Leibniz law for the highest derivative and a unitarity criterion for general linear groups. Lastly, we apply the Bernstein-Zelevinsky theory to prove the Hausdorffness and exactness of the twisted homology of split even orthogonal groups.</p></details>

Highlights include: asymptotics for cyclics between consecutive squares with a second-order term (Conj.~9), Legendre- and $k$-fold Oppermann-type results in short quadratic intervals (Conj.~6, Conj.~20, and twin cyclics between cubes, Conj.~32), gap and growth analogs (Visser, Rosser, Ishikawa, and a sum-3-versus-sum-2 inequality; Conj.~47,~52,~54,~56), limiting ratios (Vrba and Hassani; Conj.~60,~61), and structure results for Sophie Germain cyclics (Conj.~36,~37). We also resolve two Firoozbakht-type conjectures for cyclics (Conj.~41--42). On the negative side we exhibit counterexamples to the Panaitopol, Dusart, and Carneiro analogs (Conj.~59,~53,~50--51). Finally, for the lexicographically least sequence of pairwise distinct positive integers whose running averages are Fibonacci numbers (\seqnum{A248982}), we give explicit closed forms for all $n$ and prove Fried's Conjecture~2 asserting the disjointness of the parity-defined value sets (equivalently, $F_{n+2}+2nF_{n+1}$ is never a Fibonacci number).

> **Comment:** 90 pages; all comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a thick subcategory theorem for the category of $d$-excisive functors from finite spectra to spectra. This generalizes the Hopkins-Smith thick subcategory theorem (the $d=1$ case) and the $C_2$-equivariant thick subcategory theorem (the $d=2$ case). We obtain our classification theorem by completely computing the Balmer spectrum of compact $d$-excisive functors. A key ingredient is a non-abelian blueshift theorem for the generalized Tate construction associated to the family of non-transitive subgroups of products of symmetric groups. Also important are the techniques of tensor triangular geometry and striking analogies between functor calculus and equivariant homotopy theory. In particular, we introduce a functor calculus analogue of the Burnside ring and describe its Zariski spectrum \`{a} la Dress. The analogy with equivariant homotopy theory is strengthened further through two applications: We explain the effect of changing coefficients from spectra to ${\mathrm{H}\mathbb{Z}}$-modules and we establish a functor calculus analogue of transchromatic Smith-Floyd theory as developed by Kuhn-Lloyd. Our work offers a new perspective on functor calculus which builds upon the previous approaches of Arone-Ching and Glasman.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The submodule structure of mod $p$ principal series representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, for $k$ a finite field of characteristic $p$, was described by Bardoe and Sin and has played an important role in subsequent work on the mod $p$ local Langlands correspondence. The present paper studies the structure of mod $p$ principal series representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathcal{O} / \mathfrak{m}^n)$, where $\mathcal{O}$ is the ring of integers of a $p$-adic field $F$ and $\mathfrak{m}$ its maximal ideal. In particular, the multiset of Jordan-H\"older constituents is determined. In the case $n = 2$, more precise results are obtained. If $F / \mathbb{Q}_p$ is totally ramified, the submodule structure of the principal series is determined completely. Otherwise the submodule structure is infinite. When $F$ is ramified but not totally ramified, the socle and radical filtrations are determined and a specific family of submodules, providing a filtration of the principal series with irreducible quotients, is studied; this family is closely related to the image of a functor of Breuil. In the case of unramified $F$, the structure of a particular submodule of the principal series is studied; this provides a more precise description of the structure of a module constructed by Breuil and Pa\u{s}k\=unas in the context of their work on diagrams giving rise to supersingular mod $p$ representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(F)$.</p></details>

If $k$ is not algebraically closed, there might not exist an ample line bundle on $A$ defined over $k$ that represents $\lambda$. To remedy this, Poonen and Stoll have asked the following question: does there exist a line bundle on an $A$-torsor that represents $\lambda$? We give a criterion for the existence of such a torsor and line bundle which only depends on the kernel of $\lambda$. Using this criterion, we show that the answer to the question is yes when the polarization has odd or small even degree. On the other hand, we show that for every $g\geq 7$, there exists a polarized $g$-dimensional abelian variety for which the answer to the question is no.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates Srinivasa Ramanujan's initial intuitive methodology for assigning the finite value -1/12 to the sum of the divergent infinite series of all positive integers. We systematically examine Ramanujan's initial method, originally sketched in his notebooks, and set the methodology into an algebraic framework. The methodology has limited applicability to other classes of divergent series. The methodology is extended to assign a Ramanujan smoothed sum to the infinite sequences of integers raised to a positive integer power and to figurate binomial number sequences, including triangular numbers, tetrahedral numbers, and higher-dimensional analogues, avoiding analytical continuation. A key finding establishes that the Ramanujan smoothed sums of figurate binomial sequences are intrinsically connected to logarithmic numbers (Gregory coefficients), providing a novel perspective on Ramanujan summation through the lens of classical combinatorial functions. The paper applies asymptotic expansions of associated rational generating functions to demonstrate consistency with established results from analytic continuation methods. The results illuminate the deeper mathematical structures underlying Ramanujan's intuitive insights and suggest new avenues for research in divergent series summation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is well known that for Auslander algebras, the category of all (finitely generated) projective modules is an abelian category and this property of abelianness characterizes Auslander algebras by Tachikawa theorem in 1974. Let $n$ be a positive integer. In this paper, by using torsion theoretic methods, we show that $ n $-Auslander algebras can be characterized by the abelianness of the category of modules with projective dimension less than $ n $ and a certain additional property, extending the classical Auslander-Tachikawa theorem. By Auslander-Iyama correspondence a categorical characterization of the class of Artin algebras having $ n $-cluster tilting modules is obtained. Since higher Auslander algebras are a special case of higher Auslander-Gorenstein algebras, the results are given in the general setting as extending previous results of Kong. Moreover, as an application of some results, we give categorical descriptions for the semisimplicity and selfinjectivity of an Artin algebra. Higher Auslander-Gorenstein Algebras are also studied from the viewpoint of cotorsion pairs and, as application, we show that they satisfy in two nice equivalences.</p></details>

The main results on representations remain unchanged, as does the section on applications. v1: 68 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we provide a systematic way of producing representations of cohomological, K-theoretical and categorified Hall algebras, and study the output of our construction in several cases. We thus recover and categorify in a unified framework the action of the COHA of a quiver on the cohomology of Nakajima quiver variety, the action of the COHA of zero-dimensional sheaves on the the cohomology of Hilbert schemes of points and moduli spaces of Gieseker-stable sheaves on smooth surfaces, recovering the constructions of Negu\c{t} and DeHority. We also obtain new examples, associated to Pandharipande-Thomas stable pairs. Along the way, we explain carefully under which conditions one can associate to a pair $(\mathscr{C},\tau)$ consisting of a stable $\infty$-category with a t-structure a COHA. This requires a careful analysis and extension of Khan's theory of motivic Borel-Moore homology to the non quasi-compact setting, and it allows to produce new examples of COHAs arising from Bridgeland's stability conditions. The representations that we construct take an extra categorical input: that of a torsion pair $(\mathscr{T},\mathscr{F})$ on the heart $\mathscr{C}^\heartsuit$ of $\tau$. Under favorable conditions, the homology of the moduli stack associated to $\mathscr{T}$ acquires a Hall multiplication, that acts both on the left and on the right on the homology of the moduli stack associated to $\mathscr{F}$. The left action generalizes and categorifies Nakajima's positive operators, while the right action corresponds to negative operators.</p></details>

For $m\le 6$ it was shown that we can have APN functions belonging to this family. However, up to now, no construction of such polynomials is known for $m\ge 8$. In this work we provide a non-existence result of such functions whenever $r<m/8-1$, by application of techniques from algebraic varieties over finite fields. In particular, for $r=1$ we have that the construction of Calderini et al. cannot provide an APN function for $m\ge 8$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The authors define a Category $\mathcal{O}$ for any quasi-reductive Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with respect to a triangular decomposition. This much needed approach unifies many important constructions in the existing literature in a rigorous fashion. Our Category $\mathcal{O}$ encompasses all highest weight categories for Lie (super)algebras as well as specific examples which may not be highest weight categories. When the decomposition arises from a principal parabolic subalgebra $\mathfrak{p}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$, the Category $\mathcal{O}$ exhibits rich homological properties. For one, the authors show that in contrast to the case of a semisimple Lie algebra, the Category $\mathcal{O}$ is standardly stratified. Furthermore, the categorical cohomology of $\mathcal{O}$ is a finitely generated ring. This provides a first step towards developing a support variety theory for Category $\mathcal{O}$. It is shown that the complexity of modules in Category $\mathcal{O}$ is finite with an explicit upper bound given by the dimension of the subspace of the odd degree elements in $\mathfrak{g}$. This upgrades results known for $\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$ to the more general setting. Our arguments are based on foundational connections between the categorical cohomology and the relative Lie superalgebra cohomology as well as the interplay between Category $\mathcal{O}$ for $\mathfrak{g}$ and the Category $\mathcal{O}$ for its corresponding Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_{\bar 0}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma = 0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta = 0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $\gamma + \delta/e = \mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $\gamma^{(n)} + \delta^{(n)}/e = \eta^{(n)}$; $n \ge 0$ for sequences of constants $\gamma^{(n)}$, $\delta^{(n)}$, and $\eta^{(n)}$ (given respectively by full, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). We first investigate the $\gamma^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations, revealing that at least one of the pair {$\gamma,\gamma^{(2)}$} and at least two of the set {$\gamma,\gamma^{(n)},\gamma^{(n+1)},\ldots,\gamma^{(2n)}$} (for all $n \ge 2$) are transcendental. This result implies $\Gamma^{(n)}(1)$ is transcendental infinitely often for $n \ge 1$. We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $\eta^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent (and therefore transcendental) for all $n \ge 0$, implying further that at least one of each pair, {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e$} and {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e,\delta^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n \ge 1$. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tilde{\delta}^{(n)}$ and $\tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $\gamma^{(n)} + \tilde{\delta}^{(n)}/e = \tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$.</p></details>

While the polynomial algebra \(\langle T \rangle\) is abelian, the enlarged algebra \(\mathcal{A} = \mathrm{span}\{U^a E U^b, U^n\}\) exhibits finite--rank commutators confined to a finite neighborhood of the boundary. We construct explicit site-localized 2-cocycles \(\omega_j(X,Y) = \langle e_j, [X,Y] e_j \rangle\) and prove they form a basis of \(H^2(\mathcal{A},\mathbb{C})\). Quantitative bounds and finite-dimensional models confirm a sharp bulk-edge dichotomy. The framework provides a rigorous Lie-algebraic model for edge phenomena in discrete quantum systems-without violating the Jacobi identity.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for the number of joint orbits of random tuples of commuting permutations. In the uniform sampling case this generalizes the classic CLT of Goncharov for the number of cycles of a single random permutation. We also consider the case where tuples are weighted by a factor other than one, per joint orbit. We view this as an analogue of the Ewens measure, for tuples of commuting permutations, where our CLT generalizes the CLT by Hansen. Our proof uses saddle point analysis, in a context related to the Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotics and the theorem of Meinardus, but concerns a multiple pole situation. The proof is written in a self-contained manner, and hopefully in a manner accessible to a wider audience. We also indicate several open directions of further study related to probability, combinatorics, number theory, an elusive theory of random commuting matrices, and perhaps also geometric group theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The \textit{ternary digits of $2^n$} are a finite sequence of 0s, 1s, and 2s. It is a natural question to ask whether the frequency of any string of 0s, 1s, and 2s in this sequence approaches the same limit for all strings of the same length, as the exponent $n$ approaches infinity (\textit{Uniform Distribution in the limit}). Currently the answer to this question is unknown. Even a much weaker conjecture by Erd\"os is still open. But we present computational results (up to $n = 10^6$) supporting uniform distribution in the limit. In this context, we discuss implications of Benford's Law and a special case of Baker's Theorem. Then we investigate the infinite sequence of ternary digits of $\log_3(2)$. There are analogous questions about the distribution of strings of 0s, 1s, and 2s in that sequence. If there is uniform distribution in the limit, then $\log_3(2)$ is called \textit{normal to base 3}. In the absence of definitive results, we can offer again computational evidence from the first $10^6$ ternary digits of $\log_3(2)$, strongly supporting the conjecture that $\log_3(2)$ is normal to base 3.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical Stern sequence of positive integers was extended to a polynomial sequence $S_n(\lambda)$ by Klav\v{z}ar et. al. by defining $S_0(\lambda) = 0$, $S_1(\lambda) = 1$, and $$S_{2n}(\lambda) = \lambda S_n(\lambda),\quad S_{2n+1}(\lambda) = S_n(\lambda) + S_{n+1}(\lambda).$$ Dilcher et. al. conjectured that all roots of $S_n(\lambda)$ lie in the half-plane $\{\mathrm{Re} w < 1\}$. We make partial progress on this conjecture by proving that $\{|w-2| \leq 1\}\subseteq\mathbb C$ does not contain any roots of $S_n(\lambda)$. Our proof uses the Parabola Theorem for convergence of complex continued fractions. As a corollary, we establish a conjecture of Ulas and Ulas by showing that $S_p(\lambda)$ is irreducible in $\mathbb Z[\lambda]$ whenever $p$ is a positive prime.</p></details>

We investigate their factorization over $\mathbb{Q}$. In the case $a \notin \{0, \pm 1\}$, we ask whether they are irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, prove the irreducibility for several infinite families, and investigate the location of the roots of these polynomials on the complex plane. For $a=\pm1$, the factorization of $K_{a,n}$ is intimately related to that of the Cauchy--Mirimanoff polynomials $E_n$ and the polynomials $T_n$ and $S_n$ introduced by P. Nanninga. After removing the trivial factors $x$, $x-1$, and $x^2-x+1$, the remaining components agree (up to change of variable) with $E_n$, $S_n$, or $T_n$.

The latter is also implied by local Langlands, and in particular this establishes archimedean stable geometric transfer.

As an application, we deduce that the image of the lift in the degree 4 cohomology of the associated orthogonal Shimura variety has the same dimension as the lifted space of cusp forms. Our results also cover the case of moduli spaces of quasi-polarized K3 surfaces. To prove the injectivity, we introduce vector-valued indefinite Siegel theta functions of genus 2 and of Jacobi type attached to L.

In this paper, for any prism $S/A$ with a surjection $S\to R$ such that $\widehat{\mathbb L}_{\overline{S}/\overline{A}}$ is a $p$-completely flat module over $\overline{S}$, we establish an equivalence of categories between rational Hodge-Tate crystals on $(R/A)_{\Delta}$ and topologically nilpotent integrable connections on the Hodge--Tate cohomology ring $\overline{\Delta}_{R/S}$. As an application, for a non-zero divisor $a\in \overline{A}$, we introduce the concept of $a$-smallness for a rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystal on $(R/A)_{\Delta}$. Finally, we focus on some special algebras $R$ over $\mathcal O_{\mathbb C_p}$ (or generally, the ring of integers of an algebraic closed and complete non-archimedean field) including all $p$-completely smooth algebras, $p$-complete algebras with semi-stable reductions and geometric valuation rings. By using our equivalence, we analyze the restriction functor from the category of $a$-small rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystals to the category of $v$-vector bundles. This yields some new results in $p$-adic non-abelian Hodge Theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical analogy between knots and primes motivates the study of Alexander polynomials through an arithmetic perspective. In this article we study the two-parameter family of torus knots and links $T_{p,q}$ and analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the zeros of their Alexander polynomials $\Delta_{p,q}(t)$, defined with respect to the total linking number covering. We prove that as $p,q\to\infty$ these zeros become equidistributed on the unit circle and derive an explicit formula for the limiting frequency with which primitive $r$-th roots of unity appear. To capture finer statistical information, we introduce the moment sequence of the zero distribution and compute its generating function in closed form. We further examine the Iwasawa theory of the corresponding branched covers, determining the Iwasawa invariants. The logarithmic Mahler measure of $\Delta_{p,q}(t)$ vanishes identically and the associated homological growth in towers of abelian covers of $S^3$ branched along $T_{p,q}$ is subexponential.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study two families of zeta-like multiple series -- the multiple $\rho$-values and the multiple $\eta$-values -- defined by nested sums with shifted denominators. An explicit factorial formula for $\rho$ reveals its intrinsic combinatorial structure and leads to closed expressions for fixed weight and depth. A remarkable identity emerges from a weighted-sum transformation, exhibiting a perfect discrete balance. The main theorem proves that the total sums of $\rho$- and $\eta$-values coincide for equal weight but complementary depths. This correspondence provides an analytic basis for integral representations of $\eta$-values and for deriving weighted sum relations. Together, these results show that the $\rho$- and $\eta$-families form two complementary realizations of a unified analytic-combinatorial structure, bridging factorial and harmonic formulations in zeta-like multiple sums.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The generalized Markov equations are deeply connected with the generalized cluster algebras of Markov type. We construct a deformed Fock-Goncharov tropicalization for the generalized Markov equations and prove that their tropicalized tree structure is essentially the same as that of the classical Euclid tree. We then define the generalized Euclid tree and prove that it converges to the classical Euclid tree up to a scalar multiple. Moreover, by means of cluster mutations, we exhibit an asymptotic phenomenon, up to some limit q, between the logarithmic generalized Markov tree and the classical Euclid tree. A rationality conjecture of q is then put forward. We also propose a generalized Markov uniqueness conjecture for the generalized Markov equations, which illustrates an application of the asymptotic phenomenon.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct some Iwahori types, in the sense of Bushnell-Kutzko, for the double cover of an almost simple simply-laced simply-connected Chevalley group $\widetilde{G}$ over any $2$-adic field. These types capture the covering group analog of the Bernstein block of unramified principal series. We also prove that the associated Hecke algebra essentially admits an Iwahori-Matsumoto (IM) presentation. The complete presentation is obtained for types $A_{r}$, $D_{2r+1}$, $E_{6}$, $E_{7}$; for the other types, some technical obstacles remain. Those Hecke algebras with the complete IM presentation are isomorphic to Iwahori-Hecke algebras of explicit linear Chevalley groups, giving rise to Shimura correspondences. Along the way, we show that the Iwahori type extends to a hyperspecial maximal compact subgroup $\widetilde{K}\subseteq \widetilde{G}$. This extension has minimal depth among the genuine $\widetilde{K}$-representations and allows us to construct a finite Shimura correspondence, generalizing a result of Savin.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent article, Iyama and Marczinzik showed that a lattice is distributive if and only if the incidence algebra is Auslander regular, giving a new connection between homological algebra and lattice theory. In this article we study when a distributive lattice has a pure minimal injective coresolution, a notion first introduced and studied in a work of Ajitabh, Smith and Zhang. We will see that this problem naturally leads to studying when certain antichain modules are perfect modules. We give a classification of perfect antichain modules under the assumption that their canonical antichain resolution is minimal and use this to give a completion classification in lattice theoretic terms of incidence algebras of distributive lattices with pure minimal injective coresolution.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In many proofs of Fermat's Two Squares Theorem, the smallest least residue solution $x_0$ of the quadratic congruence $x^2 \equiv -1 \bmod p$ plays an essential role; here $p$ is prime and $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$. Such an $x_0$ is called a St{\o}rmer number, named after the Norwegian mathematician and astronomer Carl St{\o}rmer (1874-1957). In this paper, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for $x_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ to be a St{\o}rmer number of some prime $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$. St{\o}rmer's main interest in his investigations of St{\o}rmer numbers stemmed from his study of identities expressing $\pi$ as finite linear combinations of certain values of the Gregory-MacLaurin series for $\arctan(1/x)$. Since less than 600 digits of $\pi$ were known by 1900, approximating $\pi$ was an important topic. One such identity, discovered by St{\o}rmer in 1896, was used by Yasumasa Kanada and his team in 2002 to obtain 1.24 trillion digits of $\pi$. We also discuss St{\o}rmer's work on connecting these numbers to Gregory numbers and approximations of $\pi$. \u</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper studies a basic Markov chain, the Burnside process, on the space of flags $G/B$ with $G = GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $B$ its upper triangular matrices. This gives rise to a shuffling: a Markov chain on the symmetric group realized via the Bruhat decomposition. Actually running and describing this Markov chain requires understanding Springer fibers and the Steinberg variety. The main results give a practical algorithm for all n and q and determine the limiting behavior of the chain when q is large. In describing this behavior, we find interesting connections to the combinatorics of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence and to the geometry of orbital varieties. The construction and description is then carried over to finite Chevalley groups of arbitrary type, describing a new class of Markov chains on Weyl groups.</p></details>

Combining this result with a recent work of Klurman, Lamzouri, and Munsch, shows that the number of these zeros equals $(\log\log |d|) (\log\log \log |d|)^{\theta}$ for almost all $d$, where $|\theta|\leq 1$. This comes close to proving a conjecture of Baker and Montgomery, which predicts $\asymp \log\log |d|$ real zeros of $L'(s, \chi_d)$ in the interval $[1/2, 1]$, for almost all $d$. Moreover, assuming a mild hypothesis on the low lying zeros of quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions (which follows from GRH and the one level density conjecture of Katz and Sarnak), we fully resolve the Baker-Montgomery conjecture (up to the $\log\log\log |d|$ factor). We also show, under the same hypothesis, that for almost all $d$, $100\%$ of the real zeros of $L'(s, \chi_d)$ on $[1/2, 1]$ lie to the right of $1/2+\nu(|d|)/\log |d|$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we discuss an alternative approach to determine an asymptotic equivalent of the partial sum of the reciprocals of prime numbers. This well-known result, related to Merten's second theorem, is usually derived through methods similar to those found in Hardy and Wright's book ``An introduction to the theory of numbers'', involving comparisons with integrals. The present proof differs in several respects, combining an equivalent for the partial sum of $\Lambda(m)/m$, where $\Lambda$ denotes the von Mangoldt function, with an application of Abel's summation formula and properties of the second Chebyshev function $\Psi(x)=\sum_{n\le x}\Lambda(n)$. A simple application to the study of integers with large prime factors is also presented. Beyond the pedagogical aspect of this work, the aim is to highlight the complementarity of arithmetic functions and to show that interesting (and nontrivial) results can be obtained by means of elementary methods.</p></details>

Along the way, we develop a theory of \emph{enhanced differentials of the second kind}. This theory allows us to study algebraic de Rham cohomology in any characteristic by working directly with differentials, in contrast to the standard \v{C}ech resolution.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a general method to study representations of quivers over abstract stable homotopy theories (e.g. arbitrary rings, schemes, dg algebras, or ring spectra) in terms of Auslander-Reiten diagrams. For a finite acyclic quiver $Q$ and a stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, we prove an abstract equivalence of the representations $\mathcal{C}^Q$ with a certain mesh $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{Z}Q,\, \mathrm{mesh}}$ of representations of the repetitive quiver $\mathbb{Z}Q$, that we build inductively using abstract reflection functors. This allows to produce, from the symmetries of the Auslander-Reiten quiver, universal autoequivalences of representations $\mathcal{C}^Q$ in any stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, which are the elements of the spectral Picard group of $Q$. In particular, we get abstract versions of key functors in classical representation theory -- e.g. reflection functors, the Auslander-Reiten translation, the Serre functor, etc. Moreover, for representations of trees this enables us to realize the whole derived Picard group over a field as a factor of the spectral Picard group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We obtain the $n$th centered moments of one level densities of a large orthogonal family of $L$-functions associated with holomorphic Hecke newforms of level $q$, averaged over $q\sim Q$. We verify the Katz-Sarnak conjecture for these statistics, in the range where the sum of the supports of the Fourier transforms of test functions lies in $(-4, 4)$. In so doing, we need to understand certain phantom oversized terms, which allow us to extract the right off-diagonal contributions. We further need to resolve the combinatorial problem that arises when matching our main terms with random matrix predictions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that an arithmetic path integral over the $\ell$-torsion of a Jacobian $J[\ell]$ is equal to the trace of the Frobenius action on a representation of the Heisenberg group $H(J[\ell])$, up to an explicitly determined sign. This is an arithmetic analogue of trace--path integral formulae which arise in quantum field theory, where path integrals over a space of sections of a fibration over a circle can be expressed as the trace of the monodromy action on a Hilbert space.</p></details>
