### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07975v1'>2509.07975</a>\]&nbsp; **Quartic BV structures in supercategories and modified necklace Lie bialgebras**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nikolai Perry &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a modified version of the necklace Lie bialgebra associated to a quiver, in which the bracket and cobracket insert (rather than remove) pairs of arrows in involution. This structure is then related to canonical quartic Poisson/Batalin-Vilkovisky structures on suitable representation varieties of the quiver. Constructions on the representation side take place in symmetric monoidal $\Pi$-categories, which prompts a discussion of graded differential operators on commutative monoids in any such category. The generality of the categorical approach allows us to fully recover necklace structures, showing how the modified and classical necklace operations are related via dualisability.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The rank two Jacobi algebra $\mathcal{J}_2$ is used to provide an interpretation of the two-variable Jacobi polynomials $J_{n,k}^{(a,b,c)}(x,y)$ on the triangle, as overlaps between two representation bases. The subalgebra structure of $\mathcal{J}_2$ depicted via a pentagonal graph is exploited to find the explicit expression of the two-variable functions in terms of univariate Jacobi polynomials. It is also seen to provide an explanation for the fact that the expansion on the basis $J_{n,k}^{(a,b,c)}(x,y)$ of the polynomials obtained from the latter by permuting the variables $x,y, z=1-x-y$ and the parameters $(a,b,c)$ is given in terms of Racah polynomials. The underlying order-three symmetry is discussed.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that for any polynomial $F(X,Y_0,Y_1,Y_2) \in \mathbb{C}[X, Y_0, Y_1, Y_2]$, the equation $F(z,j(z),j'(z),j''(z))=0$ has a Zariski dense set of solutions in the hypersurface $F(X,Y_0,Y_1,Y_2)=0$, unless $F$ is in $\mathbb{C}[X]$ or it is divisible by $Y_0$, $Y_0-1728$, or $Y_1$. Our methods establish criteria for finding solutions to more general equations involving periodic functions. Furthermore, they produce a qualitative description of the distribution of these solutions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Maxim Arnold, Oleg Karpenkov &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 18 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study Euclidean algorithms and the corresponding continued fractions for oriented linear Grassmanians $G(k,n)$. We propose two algorithms: Maximal Element Elimination algorithm and Minimal Element Elimination algorithm. The first algorithm reduces the absolute maximal value of the Pl\"ucker coordinates; the algorithm works only in $G(2,n)$. The second algorithm eliminates the Pl\"ucker coordinate with the smallest absolute values, while all other coordinates may increase; the algorithm works for arbitrary $G(2,n)$. We discuss basic features of these algorithms and formulate several natural open questions for further studies.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yusuke Nemoto &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 21 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a new type of $p$-adic hypergeometric functions, which are generalizations of $p$-adic hypergeometric functions of logarithmic type defined by Asakura, and show that these functions satisfy the congruence relations similar to Asakura's. We also give numerical computations of the special values of these functions at $t=1$ and prove that these values are equal to zero under some conditions.</p></details>
