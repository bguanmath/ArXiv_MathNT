### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25038v1'>2509.25038</a>\]&nbsp; **Dold-Gauss Congruences, Norm Descent, and Rational Rigidity**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hartosh Singh Bal &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a Witt--Hadamard calculus for Euler products that unifies the classical Gauss congruences with their modern refinement, the Dold congruences. Within this framework we prove \emph{norm descent}: Dold congruences are functorial under finite extensions and preserved by prime--ideal norms $N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}$, yielding integer ghosts from algebraic ones. We extend the theory from $\mathbb{Z}$ to Dedekind domains, and show that integrality is stable under both Hadamard and Witt products. Two rigidity theorems lie at the core: a \emph{cyclotomic residues theorem}, asserting that if the logarithmic derivative has only cyclotomic poles then integrality forces rationality; and a stronger \emph{Dold$^{+}$ rigidity theorem}, showing that any algebraic series satisfying refined Dold congruences is necessarily rational. These results sharpen the Gauss--Dold picture: ordinary congruences enforce integrality, while the strengthened form collapses algebraic cases to rational ones. Applications include prime--ideal ladders in number fields and exact product laws for dynamical zeta functions, illustrated for subshifts of finite type and circle doubling.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\alpha>1$ be an irrational number and $k\ge 2$ a positive integer. Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial with positive integer coefficients. Solving a 2001 problem of S\'ark\"ozy on special sequences, Hegyv\'ari proved in 2003 that there exists an infinite sequence $A$ with density $\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{k\alpha}$ such that $$ \big\{f(a_1)+\ldots+f(a_k): a_i\in A, 1\le i\le k\big\}\cap \big\{\lfloor n\alpha\rfloor: n\in \mathbb{N}\big\}=\emptyset. $$ Hegyv\'ari also proved that the density given by him is optimal for $k=2$. In this article, we show that the density $\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{k\alpha}$ given by Hegyv\'ari is actually optimal for all $k\ge 2$. The proof will follow from a modular version of the Brunn-Minkowski inequality established here.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce rational bounded $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-laminations on a marked surface $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ as a proposed topological model for the rational tropical points $\mathcal{A}_{Sp_4,\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}(\mathbb{Q}^{\mathsf{T}})$ of the Fock--Goncharov moduli space [FG06]. Our space consists of certain equivalence classes of $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-webs introduced by Kuperberg [Kup96], together with rational measures. We define tropical coordinate systems using the $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-case of the intersection number of Shen--Sun--Weng [SSW25], and establish a bijection using the framework of the graded $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-skein algebra. This provides a topological perspective for Fock--Goncharov duality for $\mathfrak{sp}_4$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Benjamin Dequêne, Sunny Roy &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>On one hand, exact structures were introduced by D. Quillen in the '70s. They can be defined as collections of short exact sequences in a fixed abelian category satisfying additional properties. On the other hand, in a recent work, A. Garver, R. Patrias, and H. Thomas introduced Jordan recoverability. Given a bounded quiver $(Q,R)$, a full additive subcategory of $\mathrm{rep}(Q,R)$ is said to be Jordan recoverable if any $X \in \mathscr{C}$ can be recovered, up to isomorphism, from the Jordan form of its generic nilpotent endomorphisms. Such a subcategory $\mathscr{C}$ is said to be canonically Jordan recoverable if, moreover, there exists a precise algebraic procedure that allows one to get back $X \in \mathscr{C}$ from that same Jordan form data. We introduce a new family of operators, called Gen-Sub operators $\mathrm{GS}_\mathcal{E}$, parametrized by the exact structures $\mathcal{E}$ of abelian categories. After showing some properties of those operators in hereditary abelian categories, by focusing on the setting of modules over type $A$ quivers endowed with the diamond exact structure $\mathcal{E}_\diamond$, we establish that the maximal canonically Jordan recoverable subcategories are precisely of the form $\mathrm{GS}_{\mathcal{E}_\diamond}(T)$ for some tilting object $T$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16963v2'>2505.16963</a>\]&nbsp; **A Formal Proof of Complexity Bounds on Diophantine Equations**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jonas Bayer, Marco David &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** cs.LO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 17 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a universal construction of Diophantine equations with bounded complexity in Isabelle/HOL. This is a formalization of our own work in number theory. Hilbert's Tenth Problem was answered negatively by Yuri Matiyasevich, who showed that there is no general algorithm to decide whether an arbitrary Diophantine equation has a solution. However, the problem remains open when generalized to the field of rational numbers, or contrarily, when restricted to Diophantine equations with bounded complexity, characterized by the number of variables $\nu$ and the degree $\delta$. If every Diophantine set can be represented within the bounds $(\nu, \delta)$, we say that this pair is universal, and it follows that the corresponding class of equations is undecidable. In a separate mathematics article, we have determined the first non-trivial universal pair for the case of integer unknowns. In this paper, we contribute a formal verification of the main construction required to establish said universal pair. In doing so, we markedly extend the Isabelle AFP entry on multivariate polynomials, formalize parts of a number theory textbook, and develop classical theory on Diophantine equations in Isabelle. Additionally, our work includes metaprogramming infrastructure designed to efficiently handle complex definitions of multivariate polynomials. Our mathematical draft has been formalized while the mathematical research was ongoing, and benefitted largely from the help of the theorem prover. We reflect how the close collaboration between mathematician and computer is an uncommon but promising modus operandi.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove strong and explicit diameter bounds for finite simple Lie algebras, which parallel Babai's conjecture for finite simple groups. Specifically, we show that any nonabelian finite simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ over $\mathbf{F}_p$ has diameter $O((\log |\mathfrak{g}|)^D)$ for $D \approx 3.11$ with respect to any generating set. For absolutely simple classical Lie algebras over $\mathbf{F}_p$, we establish the sharper bound $O(\log |\mathfrak{g}|)$ when the Lie type is fixed and the generators are chosen uniformly at random.</p></details>

We also study several stronger variants of their original problem: determining the value of the optimal lacunarity parameter, representing rationals infinitely many times, finding such lacunary sequences with arbitrarily large jumps, and relating the maximal length of a filled interval to a prescribed lacunarity parameter.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 13 pages. Comments welcomed

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In \cite{Broer1993}, it was shown that certain line bundles on $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}}=T^*G/B$ have vanishing higher cohomology. We prove a generalization of this theorem for real reductive algebraic groups. More specifically, if $\mathcal{N}_\theta$ denotes the cone of nilpotent elements in a Cartan subspace $\mathfrak{p},$ we have a similar construction of a resolution of singularities $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}.$ We prove that for a certain cone of weights $H^i(\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta},\mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}}(\lambda))=0$ for $i> 0.$ This follows by combining a simple calculation of the canonical bundle for $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}$ with Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing. Restricting to the structure sheaf, we get a characterization of the singularities of the normalization of $\mathcal{N}_\theta.$ We use this to show that for groups of QCT (Definition 2), $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{N}_\theta]$ is equivalent as a $K$-representation to a certain cohomologically induced module giving a new proof of a result in \cite{KostantRallis1971}.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24937v1'>2509.24937</a>\]&nbsp; **Constructing Jacobians of rank 1**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Peter Koymans, Adam Morgan &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a number field, let $g \geq 1$ be an integer and let $f(x) = (x - a_1) \cdots (x - a_{2g + 1}) \in O_K[x]$ be a polynomial that splits into $2g + 1$ distinct linear factors. Write $C$ for the hyperelliptic curve given by $C: y^2 = f(x)$ and write $J = \mathrm{Jac}(C)$ for its Jacobian. Under mild technical assumptions on $f$ that are satisfied almost always, we prove that there exists some $d \in K^\times$ such that the quadratic twist $J^d$ has rank exactly equal to $1$. As a consequence, we deduce that for any positive integer $g$, there exists an absolutely simple abelian variety over $K$ with dimension equal to $g$ and rank equal to $1$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages, 2 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a Riemannian manifold $M$ and an $L^2$-normalized Laplacian eigenfunction $\psi$ on $M$ with eigenvalue $\lambda^2$, a general problem in analysis is to understand how the mass of $\psi$ distributes around $M$. There are different ways to attack this problem. One of them is to analyze the $L^p$-norm of $\psi$ restricted to a submanifold of $M$. Here, we concentrate on the case $M=S^2$, $p=2$, and we restrict to geodesics of the sphere. Burq, G\'erard, and Tzvetkov showed, for $\gamma$ a geodesic of $S^2$ (and indeed for more general surfaces), that $||\psi|_{\gamma}||_{L^2} \ll \lambda^{1/4}$ and that this bound is optimal in general. In this paper, we specialize to the case in which $\psi$ is an eigenfunction of all the Hecke operators on the sphere and consider the set of geodesics $\mathcal{C}_{D}$ of $S^2$ associated to fundamental discriminants $D<0$. By combining approaches of Ali and Magee, we improve the previous upper bound to $||\psi|_{\mathcal{C}_{D}}||_{L^2} \ll_{D,\varepsilon} \lambda^{\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon>0$, which is essentially sharp.</p></details>

> **Comment:** The previous version of this paper contained an error that affected the main results. In this revised version, we provide the corrected proofs of the results. In addition, a new coauthor has been added, who contributed substantially to identifying and resolving the issue

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In order to study cluster-tilted algebras and their intermediate coverings, Zhu introduced the notion of repetitive cluster categories, defined as the orbit categories $\mathcal D^b(\mathcal H)/\langle(\tau^{-1}\Sigma)^p\rangle$ for $1\leq p\in\mathbb{N}$, where $\mathcal H$ is a hereditary abelian category with tilting objects. In this paper, we compute partial but essential results on the Grothendieck groups of the repetitive cluster categories $\mathcal D^b({\rm mod}KA_n)/\langle(\tau^{-1}\Sigma)^p\rangle$ and $\mathcal D^b({\rm mod} KD_n)/\langle(\tau^{-1}\Sigma)^p\rangle$. Our results extend the known computations for classical cluster categories, reveal new structural patterns arising from the repetitive parameter $p$, and provide further evidence of the close interplay between Grothendieck groups, Auslander-Reiten theory, and Coxeter transformations.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Some citations corrected

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a simple Lie group. Consider a nilpotent element $e\in \mathfrak{g}$. Let $Z_G(e)$ be the centralizer of $e$ in $G$, and let $A_e:= Z_G(e)/Z_G(e)^{o}$ be its component group. Write $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$ for the set of irreducible components of the Springer fiber $\mathcal{B}_e$. We have an action of $A_e$ on $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$. When $\mathfrak{g}$ is exceptional, we give an explicit description of $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$ as an $A_e$-set. For $\mathfrak{g}$ of classical type, we describe the stabilizers for the $A_e$-action. With this description, we prove a conjecture of Lusztig and Sommers. These results suggest relations (first proposed by Lusztig) between Springer fibers and cells in Weyl groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use functorial methods to define and study $0$-abelian categories, which we propose to be the case $n = 0$ of Jasso's $n$-abelian categories. In particular, we define a bifunctor for $0$-abelian categories with enough injectives or projectives, which is analogous to the extension bifunctor for an abelian category. We prove a few results concerning this bifunctor, including $0$-abelian versions of the long exact sequence involving the extension bifunctors, of a conjecture due to Auslander on the direct summands of the extension functors, and of the Hilton-Rees theorem. These results are then applied to the study of the stable categories of a $0$-abelian category, and a similar discussion is carried out for the stable categories of an abelian category. Moreover, by specializing our results to modules over rings, we show that $0$-abelian categories with additive generators are in correspondence with semi-hereditary rings. We present applications to these rings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Buan, Iyama, Reiten and Smith proved that cluster-tilting objects in triangulated 2-Calabi--Yau categories are closely connected with mutation of quivers with potentials over an algebraically closed field. We prove a more general statement where instead of working with quivers with potentials we consider species with potential over a perfect field. We describe the $3$-preprojective algebra of the tensor product of two tensor algebras of acyclic species using a species with potential. In the case when the Jacobian algebra of a species with potential is self-injective, we provide a description of the Nakayama automorphism of a particular case of mutation of the species with potential where you mutate along orbits of the Nakayama permutation, which preserves self-injectivity. For certain types of Jacobian algebras of species with potentials, we prove that they lie in the scope of the derived Auslander-Iyama correspondence due to Jasso-Muro. Mutating along orbits of the Nakayama permutation stays within this setting, yielding a rich source of examples. All $2$-representation finite $l$-homogeneous algebras that are constructed using certain species with potential and mutations of such species with potentials are considered.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The canonical dimension is an invariant attached to admissible representations of p-adic reductive groups, which has only received significant attention in the case of mod-p representations. In the case of complex representations, the canonical dimension is closely related to the wavefront set. We find a new lower bound for the canonical dimension of a general compactly induced representation over an arbitrary coefficient field. This lower bound is uniform in the sense that it only depends on the group and not on the representation itself. In many cases, this provides a lower bound for the canonical dimension of supercuspidal representations and in the complex case we get a lower bound for the corresponding wavefront set. In order to obtain this result, we first generalize a result on the asymptotic growth of the cardinality of balls in the Bruhat-Tits building to the case of exceptional types.</p></details>

> **Comment:** We introduce the Good Ramanujan Expansions: with good decay for coefficients, studying the consequences

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this self-contained short note, we introduce the new definition of Good Ramanujan Expansion, say G.R.E., for a fixed arithmetic function $F$, building upon a good decay of its coefficients $G$; this, gains $\log-$powers w.r.t. the trivial bound for $G$ and precisely $\log^{1+\eta}$, where the present parameter $\eta>0$ is real. This property alone has important consequences for all the $F$ having a G.R.E. : mainly, 1) the Eratosthenes Transform $F'$ of our $F$ is infinitesimal (see in Theorem 1); 2) when $\eta>1$ (an enhanced decay) we have uniqueness of $G$ (actually, these are the classic Wintner-Carmichael coefficients, see Th.2); 3) we get a bound for $F$ (in Th.3); 4) an important new class of arithmetic functions $F$ can't have a G.R.E. (see Th.4). These are a generalization of Correlations; which in this way, if are, say, a kind of "far from constants", may not have a G.R.E., whence, a fortiori, can't have the R.E.E.F. This is the Ramanujan Exact Explicit Formula, that we introduced with Prof. Ram Murty.</p></details>

In analogy with Grothendieck-Malcev's results for discrete groups, we show that if a morphism $f \colon Y \to X$ of smooth projective varieties over $k=\bar{k}$ induces a surjection on the \'etale fundamental groups, then the pullback functor ${\rm Fdiv}(X)\to {\rm Fdiv}(Y)$ is fully faithful. If $f$ is surjective and the induced map is an isomorphism, then the functor is an equivalence. These results extend the theorem of Esnault-Mehta on the triviality of $F$-divided sheaves over simply connected varieties.</p></details>

A key result shows that, under certain conditions, a quasi-projective (respectively quasi-injective) S-act that is strongly co-Hopfian (respectively strongly Hopfian) is also strongly Hopfian (respectively strongly co-Hopfian). Moreover, we provide a variety of examples and structural results concerning the behavior of subacts and quotient acts of strongly Hopfian and strongly co-Hopfian S-acts, further elucidating the internal structure and interrelationships within this extended framework.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a descent monomial basis of $\Delta$-Springer modules $R_{n,\lambda,s}$, first defined by Griffin. Our construction simultaneously generalizes the descent basis for the Garsia-Procesi module $R_\lambda$ studied by Carlsson-Chou and Hanada, as well as the descent basis for the generalized coinvariant algebras $R_{n,k}$ studied by Haglund-Rhoades-Shimozono. This basis is deeply connected with a combinatorial object called battery-powered tableaux, introduced by Gillespie-Griffin. We highlight the representation theoretic properties of this monomial basis by using it to give a direct combinatorial proof of the graded Frobenius character of $R_{n,\lambda,s}$ in terms of battery-powered tableaux, a fact which has only the geometric proof of Gillespie-Griffin. We also conjecture a higher Specht basis of $R_{n,\lambda,s}$, generalizing the higher Specht basis of the coinvariant ring defined in Ariki-Terasoma-Yamada. This construction coincides with the Gillespie-Rhoades higher Specht basis for $R_{n,k}$. We give a proof for when $\lambda = (\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ is a partition of two rows.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A Bass order is an order of a number field whose fractional ideals are generated by two elements. The majority of number fields contain infinitely many Bass orders. For example, any order of a number field which contains the maximal order of a subfield with degree 2 or whose discriminant is fourth-power-free in $\mathbb{Z}$, is a Bass order. In this paper, we will propose a closed formula for the number of fractional ideals of a Bass order $R$, up to its invertible ideals, using the conductor of $R$. Since $R$ is a Bass order, this is the same as the number of overorders of $R$. We will also explain the explicit enumeration of all orders containing $R$. Our method is based on the local-global argument and the exhaustion argument, using orbital integrals for $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ as a mass formula.</p></details>

In this paper, we consider the algebraic aspect of the Lapid-Mao conjecture. More precisely, when $\mathit{\Pi}$ is $C$-algebraic, we show that the algebraicity of the adjoint $L$-value can be expressed in terms of the Petersson norm of Whittaker-rational cusp forms in $\mathit{\Pi}$, subject to the validity of the Lapid-Mao conjecture. For unitary similitude groups, we also establish an unconditional and more refined algebraicity result. Additionally, we give an explicit formula for the case $G={\rm U}(2,1)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1975, G. E. Andrews challenged the mathematics community to address L. Ehrenpreis' problem, which was to directly prove the modularity of the Rogers-Ramanujan $q$-series' summatory forms. This question is important because many different $q$-series appearing in combinatorics, representation theory, and physics often seem to be "mysteriously" modular, yet there is no general test to confirm this directly from the exotic $q$-series expressions. In this note, we solve this general problem using $q$-series algebra and $q$-series systems of differential equations. Specifically, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which a vector of holomorphic $q$-series on $|q|<1$ forms a vector-valued modular function. This result offers a clear and conceptual path to modularity for "strange" $q$-series.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The (right) $q$-deformed rational numbers was introduced by Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko, and its left variant, whose numerators and denominators are essentially the normalized Jones polynomials of rational links, by Bapat, Becker and Licata. These notions are based on continued fractions and the $q$-deformed modular group $\mathrm{PSL}_q(2,\mathbb{Z})$-actions. In this paper, we introduce the \textit{$q$-transpose} for matrices in $\mathrm{PSL}_q(2,\mathbb{Z})$ to refine the basic perspective of the theory. For example, we present a new proof and a refinement of a theorem of Leclere and Morier-Genoud stating that the trace of $A \in \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ is always palindromic and sign coherent. We also show arithmetic/combinatorial results on left $q$-deformed rationals (e.g., the criterion for their palindromicity). Finally, we discuss the connection to the conjecture of Kantarc{\i} O\u{g}uz on circular fence posets.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove asymptotic formulae for small weighted solutions of quadratic congruences of the form $\lambda_1x_1^2+\cdots +\lambda_nx_n^2\equiv \lambda_{n+1}\bmod{p^m}$, where $p$ is a fixed odd prime, $\lambda_1,...,\lambda_{n+1}$ are integer coefficients such that $(\lambda_1\cdots \lambda _{n},p)=1$ and $m\rightarrow \infty$. If $n\ge 6$, $p\ge 5$ and the coefficients are fixed and satisfy $\lambda_1,...,\lambda_n>0$ and $(\lambda_{n+1},p)=1$ (inhomogeneous case), we obtain an asymptotic formula which is valid for integral solutions $(x_1,...,x_n)$ in cubes of side length at least $p^{(1/2+\varepsilon)m}$, centered at the origin. If $n\ge 4$ and $\lambda_{n+1}=0$ (homogeneous case), we prove a result of the same strength for coefficients $\lambda_i$ which are allowed to vary with $m$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the envelopes of holomorphy of Matsuki orbits $M_{\ell,m,r}$ arising as intersections of $G_0$- and $K$-orbits in complex Grassmannians. These orbits, equipped with natural CR-structures, form a class of compact homogeneous CR-submanifolds whose analytic continuation properties are of fundamental interest. Building on Rossi's theory of holomorphic extension, we establish that the envelope of holomorphy of each Matsuki orbit coincides biholomorphically with the containing $K$-orbit $O_{\ell,m}$. Our approach provides a geometric proof based on the holomorphic fiber bundle structure $\pi : M_{\ell,m,r} \to \mathrm{Gr}_{\ell}(E_+) \times \mathrm{Gr}_{m}(E_-)$, clarifying the role of compact isotropic fibers in constraining holomorphic extension. Explicit examples, including the orbit $M_{1,1,1} \subset \mathrm{Gr}_3(\mathbb{C}^8)$, illustrate the method and highlight connections with classical constructions in complex geometry and representation theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras are studied from the perspective of representation types. We establish that (like other representation types) the notions of $E$-finiteness and $E$-tameness are invariant under mutations of quivers with potentials. Consequently, by applying our results on laminations on marked surfaces, and the results of Plamondon and the second author, we classify $E$-finite and $E$-tame finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras. More precisely, we demonstrate that (resp., except for a few cases,) a finite-dimensional Jacobian algebra $\mathcal{J}(Q,W)$ is $E$-finite (resp., $E$-tame) if and only if it is $\mathrm{g}$-finite (resp., $\mathrm{g}$-tame), if and only if it is representation-finite (resp., representation-tame), and this holds exactly when $Q$ is of Dynkin type (resp., finite mutation type), as shown by Geiss, Labardini and Schr\"{o}er. This also proves Demonet's conjecture for finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras. Furthermore, we provide an application of our results in the theory of cluster algebras. More precisely, we establish the converse of Reading's theorem: if the $\mathrm{g}$-fan of the cluster algebra associated with a connected quiver $Q$ is complete, then $Q$ must be of Dynkin type.</p></details>

Additionally, an incorrect citation was fixed, definitions were supplemented, and the structure was streamlined by merging the final section into the preceding one

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper constructs weight-shifting integral operators for Maass forms on the full modular group SL(2,Z). Under the weight parity condition t = k (mod 2), the operator utilizes an automorphic kernel constructed via Poincare series from a seed kernel. The seed kernel is defined as the product of a covariant factor and an invariant factor with respect to the diagonal action of SL(2,R). A spectral condition is imposed that the kernel must be an eigenfunction of the weight-t hyperbolic Laplacian. This problem reduces to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the invariant factor, which is identified as a Papperitz-Riemann equation. By transforming this equation into the Gauss Hypergeometric Differential Equation (HDE), the hypergeometric type of the operator is established. Analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the hypergeometric solutions yields the convergence conditions for the automorphic kernel and the integral operator, requiring the selection of the subdominant solution. The operator is defined via regularization based on the Hyperbolic Cauchy Principal Value to handle the diagonal singularities of the kernel. The automorphy of the transformed function is verified under the assumption of absolute convergence. A necessary condition for the intertwining property, namely the coincidence of the kernel's spectral parameter and the input Maass form's Laplacian eigenvalue, is conditionally derived. Analysis of the smoothness and the behavior at the cusp of the transformed function is deferred to subsequent research. Finally, the relevance of the hypergeometric structure to Hecke algebra compatibility and motivic interpretation is discussed.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study a new class of topological $G$-spaces generalizing the classical flag manifolds $G/T$ of compact connected Lie groups. These spaces, which we call the $m$-quasi-flag manifolds $ F_m = F_m(G,T) $, are topological realizations of the algebras $ Q_k(W) $ of $k$-quasi-invariant polynomials of the Weyl group $ W $ in the sense that their (even-dimensional) $G$-equivariant cohomology $ H_G(F_m, {\mathbb C}) $ is naturally isomorphic to $ Q_k(W) $, where $ m $ is a $W$-invariant integer-valued function on the system of roots of $W$ and $ k = \frac{m}{2}$ or $ \frac{m+1}{2}$ depending on whether $m$ is even or odd. Many topological properties and algebraic structures related to the flag manifolds can be extended to quasi-flag manifolds. We obtain our cohomological results by constructing rational algebraic models of quasi-flag manifolds in terms of coaffine stacks -- a certain kind of derived stacks introduced by B.To\"en and J. Lurie to provide an algebro-geometric framework for rational homotopy theory. Besides cohomology, we also compute the equivariant K-theory of quasi-flag manifolds and extend some of our cohomological results to the multiplicative setting. On the topological side, our approach is strongly influenced by the classical work on homotopy decompositions of classifying spaces of compact Lie groups; however, the diagrams that we use in our decompositions do not arise from collections of subgroups of $G$ but rather from moment graphs -- combinatorial objects introduced in a different area of topology called the GKM theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An almost self-conjugate (ASC) partition has a Young diagram in which each arm along the diagonal is exactly one box longer than its corresponding leg. Classically, the ASC partitions and their conjugates appear in two of Littlewood's symmetric function identities. These identities can be viewed as Euler characteristics of BGG complexes of the trivial representation, for classical Hermitian symmetric pairs. In this paper, we consider partitions in which the arm-leg difference is an arbitrary constant $m$. By viewing these partitions as highest weights, we establish an infinite family of dimension identities between $\mathfrak{gl}_n$- and $\mathfrak{gl}_{n+m}$-modules. We then interpret this result in the context of blocks in parabolic category $\mathcal{O}$: in particular, we exhibit six infinite families of congruent blocks whose corresponding posets of highest weights consist of the partitions in question. These posets, in turn, lead to generalizations of the Littlewood identities and their corresponding BGG complexes. Our results in this paper shed light on the surprising combinatorics underlying the work of Enright and Willenbring (2004).</p></details>

Stevens shows that there is a unique elliptic curve in $G$ with minimal Faltings height. We call this curve the Faltings elliptic curve in $G$. For every square-free integer $d$, we consider the graph~$G^d$ attached to the twisted elliptic curves in $G$ by the quadratic character of $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{d})$. It turns out that $G$ and $G^d$ are canonically isomorphic as abstract graphs (the isomorphism identifies the vertices with equal $j$-invariant). In this paper we determine which vertex is the Faltings elliptic curve in $G^d$. We also obtain the probability of a vertex in $G$ to be the Faltings elliptic curve in~$G^d$. It turns out that this probability depends on the $p$-adic valuations of rational values of certain modular functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $L$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. We calculate the dimension of $\text{Ext}^1$-groups of certain locally analytic representations of $\text{GL}_2(L)$ defined using coherent cohomology of Drinfeld curves. Furthermore, let $\rho_p$ be a $2$-dimensional continuous representation of $\text{Gal}(\bar L/L)$, which is de Rham with parallel Hodge-Tate weights $0,1$ and whose underlying Weil-Deligne representation is irreducible. We prove Breuil's locally analytic $\text{Ext}^1$ conjecture for such $\rho_p$. As an application, we show that the isomorphism class of the multiplicity space $\Pi^{\text{an}}_{\text{geo}}(\rho_p)$ of $\rho_p$ in the pro-\'etale cohomology of Drinfeld curves uniquely determines the isomorphism class of $\rho_p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1918, Hardy and Ramanujan made a breakthrough by developing the circle method to deduce an asymptotic formula for the partition function $p(n)$, which was later refined by Rademacher in 1937 to produce an absolutely convergent series representation for $p(n)$. Since then, Rademacher-type exact formulas for various partition functions have been investigated by many mathematicians. The concept of overpartitions was introduced by Lovejoy and Corteel in 2004. Kim, in 2010, studied an overpartition analogue of cubic partitions, termed as cubic overpartitions. The main objective of this paper is to establish a Rademacher-type exact formula for cubic overpartitions and, as an application, to derive an explicit error term that leads to their log-concavity. Furthermore, applying a result of Griffin, Ono, Rolen, and Zagier, we establish higher-order Tur\'{a}n inequalities for cubic overpartitions. In addition, we obtain log-subadditivity and generalized log-concavity properties for cubic overpartitions inspired by the work of Bessenrodt-Ono and DeSalvo-Pak on the ordinary partition function.</p></details>

Fixed points of the torus action on the moduli space of BPS states are labeled by super partitions. From the equivariant character of the tangent space at the fixed points we can define the Nekrasov factor for a pair of super partitions, which is used for the localization computation of the partition function. The Nekrasov factor also allows us to compute matrix elements of the action of the quantum toroidal algebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$ on the $K$ group of the moduli space. We confirm that these matrix elements are consistent with the Pieri rule of the super Macdonald polynomials.</p></details>

Around 25 years ago, Gowers proved the first reasonable upper bounds in this problem for progressions of length four and longer. In this work, Gowers initiated the study of "higher-order Fourier analysis", which has developed over the past couple of decades into a rich theory with numerous other combinatorial applications. I will report on some very recent progress in higher-order Fourier analysis and how it has led to the first ever quantitative improvement on Gowers's upper bounds when $k\geq 5$.</p></details>

From the moduli perspective, this means that there are exactly 1085 subgroups $H$ of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\widehat{\mathbb{Z}})$ of prime-power level for which there are infinitely many elliptic curves $E/K$ over quadratic extensions such that $\rho_E(G_k)$ is conjugate to a subgroup of $H$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The quantum Schur transform has become a foundational quantum algorithm, yet even after two decades since the seminal 2005 paper by Bacon, Chuang, and Harrow (BCH), some aspects of the transform remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, an alternative approach proposed by Krovi in 2018 was recently found to contain a crucial error. In this paper, we present a corrected version of Krovi's algorithm along with a detailed treatment of the high-dimensional version of the BCH Schur transform. This high-dimensional focus makes the two versions of the transform practical for regimes where the number of qudits $n$ is smaller than the local dimension $d$, with Krovi's algorithm scaling as $\widetilde{O}(n^4)$ and BCH as $\widetilde{O}(\min(n^5,nd^4))$. Our work addresses a key gap in the literature, strengthening the algorithmic foundations of a wide range of results that rely on Schur--Weyl duality in quantum information theory and quantum computation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $d$ be a positive integer. In a previous article we established a bijective correspondence between the following classes of objects, considered up to the appropriate notion of equivalence: differential graded algebras with finite-dimensional $0$-th cohomology such that the canonical generator of their perfect derived category is a basic $d\mathbb{Z}$-cluster tilting object, and basic Frobenius algebras that are twisted $(d+2)$-periodic as bimodules. For $d=1$ this correspondence specialises to previous work of the second-named author on algebraic triangulated categories of finite type. In this article, we prove a variant of our general correspondence for bimodule right Calabi--Yau dg algebras. A novel ingredient is a new cohomology theory which contains obstructions to the existence and uniqueness of minimal $A_\infty$-bimodule structures on a graded bimodule.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove various results about the Local Converse Problem for split reductive groups $G$ over a non-archimedean local field~$F$ of characteristic $0$ and residual characteristic $p$. In particular, we prove that when $G$ is a symplectic or special orthogonal group, or the exceptional group $G_2$, and $p$ is large enough, then the optimal standard Local Converse Theorem for $G(F)$ requires twisting by representations of $GL_r(F)$ with $r$ up to half the dimension of the standard representation of the dual group of $G$. However, if we restrict to generic supercuspidal representations of $G(F)$ then it can be improved when $G=SO_{2N}$; we conjecture that the same is true for symplectic and odd special orthogonal groups. We also consider the possibility of using non-standard representations of the dual group to distinguish representations, giving counterexamples to possible improvements for general linear groups, $G_2$ and $SO_{2N}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The ideal class monoid for an order $R$ in a finite field extension $E/F$ of a number field, denoted by $\overline{\mathrm{Cl}}(R)$, is a fundamental object to study in number theory which has useful applications in algebraic geometry and topology. In this paper, we describe an upper bound for $\#\overline{\mathrm{Cl}}(R)$, in terms of the class number of $E$ and (local) orbital integrals for $\mathfrak{gl}_n$. We also describe an upper bound for the class number of $E$ in terms of the Minkowski bound. When $[E:F]\leq 3$ or when $R$ is a Bass order, we refine our upper bound, using a known formula for local orbital integrals in the authors' previous work. In particular, if $R=\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^3-mx^2+(m-1)x-1)$ with $m\in \mathbb{Z}$ which arises in a study of Cappell-Shaneson homotopy 4-spheres in topology, then we further refine our upper bound in terms of the discriminants of $R$ and $E$, which is $\frac{2}{3^5} \Delta_R^{\frac{1}{2}}\cdot \Delta_E^{\frac{3}{2}}$, when $\Delta_E>3075$.</p></details>

We formulate the asymptotic for the number of integral points on $X$ bounded by a fixed norm $T>0$ as $T\rightarrow \infty$ in terms of $\kappa$-orbital integrals, which play a role in the stabilization of Arthur's trace formula. This formula coincides with the contribution of the stable conjugacy class of $\gamma$ to the geometric side of the trace formula. As an application, we obtain an asymptotic formula for the number of $n \times n$ matrices over the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_k$ whose characteristic polynomial equals a fixed irreducible polynomial $\chi(x)$ of degree $n$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Skolem Problem asks to determine whether a given linear recurrence sequence (LRS) has a zero term. Showing decidability of this problem is equivalent to giving an effective proof of the Skolem-Mahler-Lech Theorem, which asserts that a non-degenerate LRS has finitely many zeros. The latter result was proven over 90 years ago via an ineffective method showing that such an LRS has only finitely many $p$-adic zeros. In this paper we consider the problem of determining whether a given LRS has a $p$-adic zero, as well as the corresponding function problem of computing exact representations of all $p$-adic zeros. We present algorithms for both problems and report on their implementation. The output of the algorithms is unconditionally correct, and termination is guaranteed subject to the $p$-adic Schanuel Conjecture (a standard number-theoretic hypothesis concerning the $p$-adic exponential function). While these algorithms do not solve the Skolem Problem, they can be exploited to find natural-number and rational zeros under additional hypotheses. To illustrate this, we apply our results to show decidability of the Simultaneous Skolem Problem (determine whether two coprime linear recurrences have a common natural-number zero), again subject to the $p$-adic Schanuel Conjecture.</p></details>

Studying the subrepresentation of $\Gamma$-locally analytic vectors, $W^{\mathrm{la}}$, is useful because $W^{\mathrm{la}}$ can be analyzed via the Lie algebra $\mathrm{Lie}(\Gamma)$, which simplifies the action of $\Gamma$. Additionally, $W^{\mathrm{la}}$ often behaves as a decompletion of $W$, making it closer to an algebraic or geometric object. This article introduces a notion of locally analytic vectors for $W$ in a mixed characteristic setting, specifically for $\mathbb{Z}_p$-Tate algebras. This generalization encompasses the classical definition and also specializes to super-H\"older vectors in characteristic $p$. Using binomial expansions instead of Taylor series, this new definition bridges locally analytic vectors in characteristic $0$ and $p$. Our main theorem shows that under certain conditions, the map $W \mapsto W^{\mathrm{la}}$ acts as a descent, and the derived locally analytic vectors $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{la}}^i(W)$ vanish for $i \geq 1$. This result extends Theorem C of \cite{Po24}, providing new tools for propagating information about locally analytic vectors from characteristic $0$ to characteristic $p$. We provide three applications: a new proof of Berger-Rozensztajn's main result using characteristic $0$ methods, the introduction of an integral multivariable ring $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}_{\mathrm{LT}}^{\dagger,\mathrm{la}}$ in the Lubin-Tate setting, and a novel interpretation of the classical Cohen ring ${\mathbf{A}}_{\mathbb{Q}_p}$ from the theory of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules in terms of locally analytic vectors.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the action of the full twist is a Serre functor in the homotopy category of dihedral Soergel Bimodules. Our proof relies on the representability of a certain partial trace functor, which we prove using the diagrammatics for Hochschild cohomology of Soergel Bimodules. Leveraging these representability results, we then compute the triply-graded link homology of the Whitehead link.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The ring of dual integers is the bounded polynomial ring $\mathbb Z[\epsilon]=\mathbb Z[T]/(T^2)$ with integer coefficients. We describe the (finitely generated) Gorenstein-projective $\mathbb Z[\epsilon]$-modules as the torsionless $\mathbb Z[\epsilon]$-modules, or equivalently, as the perfect differential structures of abelian groups. Moreover, the stable category of G-proj$\mathbb Z[\epsilon]$ modulo projectives is shown to be equivalent to the orbit category $\mathcal D^b(\mathbb Z)/[1]$ of the derived category of the integers and to the homotopy category of perfect differential structures. We note that the category G-proj$\mathbb Z[\epsilon]$ is related to the embeddings of a subgroup in a free abelian group and has a quotient which is equivalent to the category of finite abelian groups. In fact, we present a cube which has as vertices eight related categories and as edges functors which are such that the faces of the cube give rise to commutative diagrams. Among interesting properties in G-proj$\mathbb Z[\epsilon]$, we note that uniqueness of direct sum decomposition fails.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the series of reciprocals of those positive integers with exactly $k$ occurrences of a given $b$-ary digit $d$ (Irwin series), and obtain for their sums geometrically convergent representations. They are expressed in terms of the moments and Stieltjes transforms of certain measures on the unit interval and involve certain recurrences which convert straightforwardly into a numerical implementation. This framework allows a new perspective on the limit for large $k$, and is the basis for obtaining, as the author has done in further works, the asymptotics for large $b$.</p></details>
