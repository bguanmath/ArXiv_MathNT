 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** D. R. Heath-Brown &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that there are $O(B^{3/5-3/1555+\ep})$ triples $(x,y,z)$ of square-full integesr up to $B$ satisfying the equation $x+y=z$ for any fixed $\ep>0$. This is the first improvement over the `easy' exponent $3/5$, given by Browning and Van Valckenborgh. One new tool is a strong uniform bound for the counting function for equations $aX^3+bY^3=cZ^3$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute extension groups in the category of duals of $p$-adic Banach space representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. Focusing on representations arising from the $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence for generic Galois representations, we classify these extensions completely. These results are then applied to prove the vanishing of extensions between the duals of reducible representations and supercuspidal isotypic components of the ètale cohomology of the finite level Drinfeld spaces.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Olivier Taïbi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Euler characteristic of $\ell$-adic local systems on the moduli stack $\mathcal{A}_n$ of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension $n$ associated to algebraic representations of $\mathbf{GSp}_{2n}$, as virtual representations of the absolute Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}$ and the unramified Hecke algebra of $\mathbf{GSp}_{2n}$. To this end we take the last steps of the Ihara-Langlands-Kottwitz method to compute the intersection cohomology of minimal compactifications of Siegel modular varieties in level one, following work of Kottwitz and Morel, proving an unconditional reformulation of Kottwitz' conjecture in this case. This entails proving the existence of $\mathrm{GSpin}$-valued Galois representations associated to certain level one automorphic representations for $\mathbf{PGSp}_{2n}$ and $\mathbf{SO}_{4n}$. As a consequence we prove the existence of $\mathrm{GSpin}$-valued Galois representations associated to level one Siegel eigenforms, a higher genus analogue of theorems of Deligne (genus one) and Weissauer (genus two). Using Morel's work and Franke's spectral sequence we derive explicit formulas expressing the Euler characteristic of compactly supported cohomology of automorphic $\ell$-adic local systems on Siegel modular varieties in terms of intersection cohomology. Specializing to genus three and level one, we prove an explicit conjectural formula of Bergström, Faber and van der Geer for the compactly supported Euler characteristic in terms of spin Galois representations associated to level one Siegel cusp forms. Specializing to trivial local systems we give explicit formulas for the number of points of $\mathcal{A}_n$ over finite fields for all $n \leq 7$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09744v2'>2209.09744</a>\]&nbsp; **A Nomizu-van Est theorem in Ekedahl's derived $\ell$-adic setting**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Olivier Taïbi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 48 pages, minor changes

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A theorem of Nomizu and van Est computes the cohomology of a compact nilmanifold, or equivalently the group cohomology of an arithmetic subgroup of a unipotent linear algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}$. We prove a similar result for the cohomology of a compact open subgroup of a unipotent linear algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}_{\ell}$ with coefficients in a complex of continuous $\ell$-adic representations. We work with the triangulated categories defined by Ekedahl which play the role of ``derived categories of continuous $\ell$-adic representations''. This is motivated by Pink's formula computing the derived direct image of an $\ell$-adic local system on a Shimura variety in its minimal compactification, and its application to automorphic perverse sheaves on Shimura varieties. The key technical result is the computation of the cohomology with coefficients in a unipotent representation with torsion coefficients by an explicit complex of polynomial cochains which is of finite type.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that there are only finitely many finite fields whose members are the sum of an $n$-potent element and a $5$-potent element. Combining this with the algorithmic results provided by S.D. Cohen {\it et al.}, we confirm in the affirmative the conjecture in \cite{Cohen} concerning all finite fields satisfying this condition. Furthermore, we obtain several elementary results for General problem, proving that the number of finite fields satisfying general condition is also finite.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24882v4'>2510.24882</a>\]&nbsp; **Modular Periodicity of Random Initialized Recurrences**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Marc T. Pudelko &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 9 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Classical studies of the Fibonacci sequence focus on its periodicity modulo $m$ (the Pisano periods) with canonical initialization. We investigate instead the complete periodic structure arising from all $m^2$ possible initializations in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. We discover perfect mirror symmetry between the Fibonacci recurrence $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and its parity transform $a_n = - a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and observe fractal self-similarity in the extension from prime to prime power moduli. Additionally, we classify prime moduli based on their quadratic reciprocity and demonstrate that periodic sequences exhibit weight preservation under modular extension. Furthermore, we define a minima distribution $P(n)$ governed by Lucas ratios, which satisfies the symmetric relation $P(n)=P(1-n)$. For cyclotomic recurrences, we propose explicit counting functions for the number of distinct periods with connections to necklace enumeration. These findings imply potential connections to Viswanath's random recurrence, modular forms and L-functions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages, comments very welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a weak form of formality for differential graded algebras, called $A_3$-formality, for the cohomology of pro-p Demushkin groups at odd primes p. We show that the differential graded $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebras of continuous cochains of Demushkin groups with q-invariant not equal 3 are $A_3$-formal, whereas Demushkin groups with q-invariant 3 are not $A_3$-formal. We prove these results by an explicit computation of the Benson-Krause-Schwede canonical class in Hochschild cohomology.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22651v2'>2506.22651</a>\]&nbsp; **The Dedekind-Hasse Criterion in Quaternion Algebras**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Adriana Cardoso, António Machiavelo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that a criterion for an integral domain to be a principal ideal domain (PID), due to Dedekind and Hasse, can also be applied in quaternion orders, and that it can be used to build a finite algorithm to determine if a given order is a principal left (or right) ideal domain. Using this algorithm, we give an alternative proof that the maximal orders of discriminant 7 and 13, which are non-Euclidean, are PIDs. We also provide a completely arithmetic proof of a result of Gordon Pall that shows that, in an order that is a PID, an element of whose norm is divisible by an integer $m$ always has a left and a right divisor with norm $m$. This easily yields the existence and uniqueness (up to associates) of factorizations of a quaternion modeled on a factorization of its norm.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Heizo Sakamoto &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 61 pages. Minor corrections and references added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Kashiwara-Kim-Oh-Park introduced a wide family of monoidal categories of finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras, which provide monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras. In this paper, we prove that, for types $ADE$, some of these categories provide monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras of affine type. Moreover, by means of the combinatorial theory of affine type cluster algebras, we give a complete classification of real and imaginary simple modules in these categories. In particular, we show that, in these cases, the conjecture asserting that real simple modules correspond exactly to cluster monomials holds.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nat Sothanaphan &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a writeup of a resolution of Erdős Problem #728; this is the first Erdos problem (a problem proposed by Paul Erdős which has been collected in the Erdos Problems website) regarded as fully resolved autonomously by an AI system. The system in question is a combination of GPT-5.2 Pro by OpenAI and Aristotle by Harmonic, operated by Kevin Barreto. The final result of the system is a formal proof written in Lean, which we translate to informal mathematics in the present writeup for wider accessibility. The proved result is as follows. We show a logarithmic-gap phenomenon regarding factorial divisibility: For any constants $0<C_1<C_2$ there exist infinitely many triples $(a,b,n)\in\mathbb N^3$ such that $$ a!\,b!\mid n!\,(a+b-n)!\qquad\text{and}\qquad C_1\log n < a+b-n < C_2\log n. $$ The argument reduces this to a binomial divisibility $\binom{m+k}{k}\mid\binom{2m}{m}$ and studies it prime-by-prime. By Kummer's theorem, $ν_p\binom{2m}{m}$ translates into a carry count for doubling $m$ in base $p$. We then employ a counting argument to find, in each scale $[M,2M]$, an integer $m$ whose base-$p$ expansions simultaneously force many carries when doubling $m$, for every prime $p\le 2k$, while avoiding the rare event that one of $m+1,\dots,m+k$ is divisible by an unusually high power of $p$. These "carry-rich but spike-free" choices of $m$ force the needed $p$-adic inequalities and the divisibility. The overall strategy is similar to results regarding divisors of $\binom{2n}{n}$ studied earlier by Erdős and by Pomerance.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we prove a coherent version of geometric Satake equivalence proposed in Cautis-Williams' work arXiv:2306.03023 for type A. In their work, they studied an abelian version of the classical limit Satake category, namely, the Koszul perverse heart of the categorified Coulomb branch for adjoint representations. In this paper we study a subcategory generated by a collection of simple objects. We endow this subcategory with a neutral Tannakian structure and identify it with the finite dimensional representation category $\mathrm{Rep}({\check{G}})$ for the Langlands dual group ${\check{G}}$. Our method uses tools in Cautis-Williams theory and a Hodge module description of the coherent IC extensions of differential sheaves in Xin's work arXiv:2503.14890.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The extriangulated category is a simultaneous generalization of exact categories and triangulated categories. H. Nakaoka and Y. Palu have proved that the homotopy category of an admissible model structure on a weakly idempotent complete extriangulated category is a triangulated category. Using the classic construction of distinguished triangles given by A. Heller and D. Happel, this paper provides an alternative proof of Nakaoka - Palu Theorem. In fact, the class $Δ$ of distinguished triangles in the present paper and the class $\widetildeΔ$ of distinguished triangles in \cite{NP} have the relation $Δ= - \widetildeΔ$, and hence the two triangulated structures on the homotopy category are isomorphic.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 11 pages, to appear in Interdisciplinary Studies of Complex Systems

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The paper is devoted to the study of conditions for the Hausdorff-Besicovitch faithfulness of the family of cylinders generated by Cantor series expansions. We show that there exist subgeometric Cantor series expansions for which the corresponding families of cylinders are not faithful for the Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension on the unit interval. On the other hand we found a rather wide subfamily of subgeometric Cantor series expansions generating faithful families of cylinders. We also study conditions for the Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension preservation on [0;1] by probability distribution functions of random variables with independent symbols of arithmetic Cantor series expansions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** The result of arXiv:2210.05290 by the same authors has been covered and further generalized by the current preprint

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $D$ be a totally definite quaternion algebra over a totally real number field $F$, and $\mathcal{O}$ be an $O_F$-order (of full rank) in $D$. The type number $t(\mathcal{O})$ is an important arithmetic invariant of $\mathcal{O}$ that counts the number of isomorphism classes of orders belonging to the same genus as $\mathcal{O}$ (i.e. locally isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}$ at every finite place $\mathfrak{p}$ of $F$). The type number formula has been studied by Eichler, Peters, Pizer, Vigneras, Körner and many others. As the genus of $\mathcal{O}$ further divides into spinor genera, one naturally seeks a finer type number formula for the number of isomorphism classes of orders belonging to the same spinor genus of $\mathcal{O}$. The main goal of this paper is to provide such a refinement for a large class of quaternion $O_F$-orders $\mathcal{O}$ that includes all Eichler orders. This enables us to prove that $t(\mathcal{O})$ is divisible by the order of a quotient group $\mathrm{WSG}(\mathcal{O})$ of the Gauss genus group $\mathrm{Cl}^+(O_F)/\mathrm{Cl}^+(O_F)^2$ naturally attached to $\mathcal{O}$. Similarly, we show that the trace of the $\mathfrak{n}$-Brandt matrix $\mathfrak{B}(\mathcal{O}, \mathfrak{n})$ is divisible by the class number $h(F)$ for any nonzero integral $O_F$-ideal $\mathfrak{n}$. In particular, the class number $h(\mathcal{O})=\mathrm{Tr}(\mathfrak{B}(\mathcal{O}, O_F))$ is always divisible by $h(F)$ for such quaternion orders. This generalizes the divisibility result of $h(\mathcal{O})$ proved in a different way by Chia-Fu Yu and the second named author [Indiana Univ. Math. J., Vol. 70, No. 2 (2021)] in the case when $\mathcal{O}$ is a maximal $O_F$-order in a totally definite quaternion algebra unramified at all the finite places.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $g(X)$ be a polynomial over a finite field ${\mathbb F}_q$ with degree $o(q^{1/2})$, and let $χ$ be the quadratic residue character. We give a polynomial time algorithm to recover $g(X)$ (up to perfect square factors) given the values of $χ\circ g$ on ${\mathbb F}_q$, with up to a constant fraction of the values having errors. This was previously unknown even for the case of no errors. We give a similar algorithm for additive characters of polynomials over fields of characteristic $2$. This gives the first polynomial time algorithm for decoding dual-BCH codes of polynomial dimension from a constant fraction of errors. Our algorithms use ideas from Stepanov's polynomial method proof of the classical Weil bounds on character sums, as well as from the Berlekamp-Welch decoding algorithm for Reed-Solomon codes. A crucial role is played by what we call *pseudopolynomials*: high degree polynomials, all of whose derivatives behave like low degree polynomials on ${\mathbb F}_q$. Both these results can be viewed as algorithmic versions of the Weil bounds for this setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The d'Arcais polynomials $P_n(z)$ for $n\in\{0,1,\dots\}$ are defined as $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} P_n(z) q^n = \exp(-z\ln((q;q)_{\infty}))$ where the $q$-Pochhammer symbol is $(q;q)_{\infty} = \prod_{k=1}^{\infty} (1-q^k)$ for $|q|<1$. Denoting the coefficients for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by the formula $P_n(z) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A(2,n,k) z^k/n!$, we prove that $k_n! A(2,n,k_n)/n!$ satisfies a Bahadur-Rao type large deviation formula in the limit $n \to \infty$ with $k_n/n \to κ\in [0,1)$ as long as $k_n \to \infty$. The large deviation rate function is the Legendre-Fenchel transform $g^*(-κ)$ where $g(κ) = f^{-1}(κ)$ for the function $f : (0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $f(y)= \ln(-\ln((e^{-y};e^{-y})_{\infty}))$. We relate this fact to information about the abundancy index.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We settle an open problem regarding palindromes; that is, positive integers which are the same when written forwards and backwards. In particular, we prove that for any fixed base $b\geq 2$, there exist infinitely many square-free palindromes in base $b$. We also provide an asymptotic expression for the number of such integers $\leq x$. The core of our proof utilises a hybrid $p$-adic/Archimedean van der Corput process, used in conjunction with an equidistribution estimate of Tuxanidy and Panario, as well as an elementary argument of Cilleruelo, Luca and Shparlinski.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A set $\mathcal S\subset \mathbb N$ is said to be a \textit{subset-sum-distinct} or \textit{dissociated} if all of its finite subsets have different sums. Alternately, an equivalent classification is if any equality of the form $$\sum_{s\in \mathcal S} \varepsilon_s \cdot s =0$$ where $\varepsilon_s \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ implies that all the $\varepsilon_s$'s are $0$. For a dissociated set $\mathcal S$, we prove that for $c_\ast = \frac 12 \log_2 \left(\frac π2\right)$ and any $c_\ast-1<C<c_\ast$, we have $$\mathcal S(n) \,:=\, \mathcal S\cap [1,n] \,\le\, \log_2 n +\frac 12 \log_2\log_2 n + C$$ for all $n\in \mathcal N_C$ with asymptotic density $\mathbf d\left(\mathcal N_C\right)=2-2^{c_\ast-C}$. Further, we consider the greedy algorithm for generating these sets and prove that this algorithm always eventually doubles. Finally, we also consider some generalizations of dissociated sets and prove similar results about them.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we are interested in the stability of the $2$-rank of the class group in the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-extension of real biquadratic fields. In fact, we give several families of real biquadratic fields $K$ such that $ rank(A(K)) =rank(A_\infty(K))$ and $rank(A(K))\leq 3$, where $A(K)$ and $A_\infty(K)$ are the $2$-class group and the $2$-Iwasawa module of $K$ respectively. Moreover, Greenberg's conjecture is verified for some new families of number fields; in particular, we determine the complete list of all real biquadratic fields with trivial $2$-Iwasawa module. This work is a continuation of M. M. Chems-Eddin, Greenberg's conjecture and Iwasawa module of real biquadratic fields I, J. Number Theory, 281 (2026), 224-266.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this study, we introduce the theory of what we call Hecke vector-forms. A Hecke vector-form can be viewed as a vector function representation of some quasiautomorphic form that transforms like an automorphic form on an arbitrarily chosen Hecke triangle group. In other words, because quasiautomorphic forms have complicated transformation behavior when compared with automorphic forms, the construction of a Hecke vector-form is to retrieve a transformation behavior analogous to the simpler, automorphic case. In this way, a Hecke vector-form can be viewed as the vector function analogue of an automorphic form. Since our work is for any quasi-automorphic form over an arbitrary Hecke triangle group, we briefly review the construction of such groups. Furthermore, we review the derivation of the hauptmodul, the automorphic forms, and the normalized quasiautomorphic form of weight 2 for any Hecke triangle group. We then proceed to the theory of Hecke vector-forms and establish the desired transformation behavior with respect to the generators of the associated group. A proof of this fact is strictly elementary, relying on fine properties of binomial coefficients. Lastly, we relate the vector-forms to Hecke automorphic linear differential equations, which are analogues of the frequently researched modular linear differential equations. Our results include Hecke vector-forms of the classical quasimodular forms as the simplest case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For each $N\geq 2$, Asakura and Otsubo have recently introduced a smooth family of algebraic curves $\{X_{N,λ}\}_{λ\in \mathbb{P}^1\setminus \{0, 1, \infty\}}$ in characteristic 0 that is closely related to hypergeometric functions and the Fermat curve of degree $N$. In this paper, we study the Gross-Kudla-Schoen modified diagonal 1-cycles of these curves. We prove that if $p \ge 3$ is a prime, then for every $λ$ the Griffiths Abel-Jacobi image of the modified diagonal cycle of $X_{p,λ}$ is nontrivial for every cuspidal choice of a base point. On the other hand, we show that the modified diagonal cycle and hence the Ceresa cycle of $X_{3,λ}$ is torsion in the Chow group for every $λ$ and every choice of a base point.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Quantum groups of semisimple Lie algebras at roots of unity admit several different forms. Among them is the De Concini-Kac form, which is the easiest to define but, perhaps, hardest to study. In this paper, we propose a suitable modification to the De Concini-Kac form, namely the even part algebra, which has some appealing features. Notably, it behaves uniformly with respect to the order of the roots of unity and admits an adjoint action of the Lusztig form. We revisit several results due to De Concini-Kac-Procesi and Tanisaki for the even part algebra. Namely, we give conceptual definitions of the Frobenius and Harish-Chandra centers and describe the entire center in terms of these two subalgebras getting a complete quantum analog of the Veldkamp theorem on the center of the universal enveloping algebras in positive characteristic. We investigate the Azumaya locus of the even part algebra over its center. We also show that the locally finite part of the even part algebra under the adjoint action of the Lusztig form is isomorphic to the reflection equation algebra, which is the quantized coordinate algebra with the product twisted by $R$-matrix. Some results on Lusztig forms at roots of unity are revisited and proved in greater generality including Kempf vanishing theorem and good filtrations on the quantized coordinate algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Newman's conjecture (proved by Rodgers and Tao in 2018) concerns a certain family of deformations $\{ξ_t(s)\}_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$ of the Riemann xi function for which there exists an associated constant $Λ\in \mathbb{R}$ (called the de Bruijn-Newman constant) such that all the zeros of $ξ_t$ lie on the critical line if and only if $t \geq Λ$. The Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that $Λ\leq 0$, and Newman's conjecture states that $Λ\geq 0$. In this paper we give a new proof of Newman's conjecture which avoids many of the complications in the proof of Rodgers and Tao. Unlike the previous best methods for bounding $Λ$, our approach does not require any information about the zeros of the zeta function, and it can be readily be applied to a wide variety of $L$-functions. In particular, we establish that any $L$-function in the extended Selberg class has an associated de Bruijn-Newman constant and that all of these constants are nonnegative. Stated in the Riemann xi function case, our argument proceeds by showing that for every $t < 0$ the function $ξ_t$ can be approximated in terms of a Dirichlet series $ζ_t(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\exp(\frac{t}{4} \log^2 n)n^{-s}$ whose zeros then provide infinitely many zeros of $ξ_t$ off the critical line.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the dynamics of algebraic families of maps on $\mathbb{P}^N$, over the field $\mathbb{C}$ of complex numbers, and the geometry of their preperiodic points. The goal of this note is to formulate a conjectural characterization of the subvarieties of $S \times\mathbb{P}^N$ containing a Zariski-dense set of preperiodic points, where the parameter space $S$ is a quasiprojective complex algebraic variety; the characterization is given in terms of the non-vanishing of a power of the invariant Green current associated to the family of maps. This conjectural characterization is inspired by and generalizes the Relative Manin-Mumford Conjecture for families of abelian varieties, recently proved by Gao and Habegger, and it includes as special cases the Manin-Mumford Conjecture (theorem of Raynaud) and the Dynamical Manin-Mumford Conjecture (posed by Ghioca, Tucker, and Zhang). We provide examples where the equivalence is known to hold, and we show that several recent results can be viewed as special cases. Finally, we give the proof of one implication in the conjectural characterization.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For each integer $d\geq 2$, let $M_d$ denote the moduli space of maps $f: \mathbb{P}^1\to \mathbb{P}^1$ of degree $d$. We study the geometric configurations of subsets of postcritically finite (or PCF) maps in $M_d$. A complex-algebraic subvariety $Y \subset M_d$ is said to be PCF-special if it contains a Zariski-dense set of PCF maps. Here we prove that there are only finitely many positive-dimensional irreducible PCF-special subvarieties in $M_d$ with degree $\leq D$. In addition, there exist constants $N = N(D,d)$ and $B = B(D,d)$ so that for any complex algebraic subvariety $X \subset M_d$ of degree $\leq D$, the Zariski closure $\overline{X\cap\mathrm{PCF}}~$ has at most $N$ irreducible components, each with degree $\leq B$. We also prove generalizations of these results for points with small critical height in $M_d(\bar{\mathbb{Q}})$.</p></details>

In recent years, there has been a lot of activity on the representation theory of the subclass of left regular bands due to connections to Markov chains associated to hyperplane arrangements, oriented matroids, matroids and CAT(0) cube complexes. We prove here that the integral semigroup algebra of a band is isomorphic to the integral path algebra of a quiver modulo an admissible ideal. This leads to a uniform bound quiver presentation for band algebras over all fields. Also, we answer a question of Margolis, Saliola and Steinberg by proving that the integral semigroup algebra of a CW left regular band is isomorphic to the quotient of the integral path algebra of the Hasse diagram of its support semilattice modulo the ideal generated by the sum of all paths of length two. This includes, for example, hyperplane face semigroup algebras.</p></details>

The new proof of SG prime infinitude avoids earlier reliance on congruence manipulations modulo the unique maximal ideal of the valuation domain. Added natural density section 7 proving quantitative APRC

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An ideal setting to exhibit infinite sets of primes $p$ relative to which an integer is a primitive root $\pmod p$ is provided by the Bézout subdomain $\widetilde{\mathbb{B}}:=\mathbb{Z}^{\mathbb{P}}/\mathfrak{U}$ of the valuation domain $\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}=\prod_{\mathfrak{U}} \mathbb{Z}_p$ with respect to a nonprincipal ultrafilter $\mathfrak{U}$ on $\mathbb{P}$, extant via Chebotarev's theorem and the ultrafilter theorem and such that the relative algebraic closure $\mathbb{L}:=\mathrm{Abs}(\widetilde{\mathbb{Q}})$ of the prime field of the valued field $\widetilde{\mathbb{Q}}=\prod_{\mathfrak{U}} \mathbb{Q}_p$ contains $\sqrt{-\tilde p}$ for $p\in\mathbb{P}$, contains no $\sqrt[3]{\tilde q}$ for $q\in\mathbb{P}$, and has $\mathrm{tor}(\mathbb{L}^\times)=\langle ζ_6\rangle$. Results include positive resolutions of the conjectured infinitude of primes $p$ for which (i) $\frac{p-1}{6}$ is prime and (ii) a non-perfect-square $-1\neq m\in\mathbb{Z}$ is a primitive root $\pmod p$, establishing as manifest the efficacy of ultraproduct treatments in resolving number theory problems requiring certification of countably infinite conforming sets. Furthermore, we extend these results to the quantitative regime by identifying the primitive-root indicator as a projection in the $C^\ast$-algebra $\ell^\infty(\mathbb{P})$. We prove that the Bézout rigidity of $\widetilde{\mathbb{B}}$ and the $\mathbf{\tildeν}$-anchor enforce the normality of the density state, thereby algebraically precluding ``spectral leakage'' into the infinite tail of Kummer obstructions. This provides a structural, GRH-free proof that the natural density exists as the vacuum expectation value in a GNS representation: $δ_m=ω_δ(f_m)= c_m\prod_{q\in\mathbb{P}}(1-\frac{1}{q(q-1)})$ where $\prod_{q\in\mathbb{P}}(1-\frac{1}{q(q-1)})$ is the Artin Euler product.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we investigate multiple polylogarithms with non-positive multi-indices (nonpositive MPLs) from a combinatorial and algebraic viewpoint. By introducing a correspondence between non-positive multiple polylogarithms and Magnus polynomials in a free associative algebra, we obtain an explicit Magnus-type representation of products of mono-indexed non-positive MPLs. The main identity (Theorem A) expresses such a product as a single non-positive MPL indexed by a Magnus polynomial, which may be regarded as a Möbius inversion of the expansion formula due to Duchamp-Hoang Ngoc Minh-Ngo. Moreover, we study the effects of permuted indices and show that certain differences of Magnus polynomials belong to the kernel of the linear map ${\rm Li}^-_{\bullet}$ , leading to new functional equations among non-positive MPLs of the same weight and depth. These results clarify the combinatorial structure underlying non-positive MPLs and reveal a close connection with the Magnus expansion in non-commutative algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Hurwitz spaces which parametrize branched covers of the line play a prominent role in inverse Galois theory. This paper surveys fifty years of works in this direction with emphasis on recent advances. Based on the Riemann-Hurwitz theory of covers, the geometric and arithmetic setup is first reviewed, followed by the semi-modern developments of the 1990--2010 period: large fields, compactification, descent theory, modular towers. The second half of the paper highlights more recent achievements that have reshaped the arithmetic of Hurwitz spaces, notably via the systematic study of the ring of components. These include the construction of components defined over ${\mathbb Q}$, and the Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland approach to rational points over finite fields, applied to the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics and the Malle conjecture over function fields ${\mathbb F}_q(T)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a contour integral formalism for computing the K-theoretic equivariant 3-vertex. Within the Jeffrey--Kirwan (JK) residue framework, we show that, by an appropriate choice of the reference vector, both the equivariant Donaldson--Thomas (DT) and Pandharipande--Thomas (PT) 3-vertices can be extracted from the same integrand. We analyze three distinct limits of the PT 3-vertex, recovering the unrefined topological vertex, the refined topological vertex, and the Macdonald refined topological vertex. Higher-rank extensions of PT counting and the DT/PT correspondence are also explored. From a quantum algebraic perspective, we construct an operator version of the equivariant PT 3-vertex and term it the Pandharipande--Thomas $qq$-character. We then discuss its connection with the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{1}$.</p></details>

Under this isomorphism, we show that the relative braid group action on this iweight space coincides with the action of the type B Hecke algebra in the iSchur duality. As a consequence, we derive from multiplicity-free decompositions that the iweight $\overlineρ$ spaces of irreducible modules over iquantum groups are irreducible modules over the type B Hecke algebra.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The splitting field of an elliptic surface $\mathcal{E}/\mathbb{Q}(t)$ is the smallest finite extension $\mathcal{K} \subset \mathbb{C}$ such that all $\mathbb{C}(t)$-rational points are defined over $\mathcal{K}(t)$. In this paper, we provide a symbolic algorithmic approach to determine the splitting field and a set of $68$ linearly independent generators for the Mordell--Weil lattice of Shioda's elliptic surface $Y^2=X^3 +t^{360} +1$. This surface is noted for having the largest known rank 68 for an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{C}(t)$. Our methodology utilizes the known decomposition of the Mordell-Weil Lattice of this surface into Lattices of ten rational elliptic surfaces and one $K3$ surface. We explicitly compute the defining polynomials of the splitting field, which reach degrees of 1728 and 5760, and verify the results via height pairing matrices and specialized symbolic software packages.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop the basic theory of eigenvalues of $p$-adic random matrices, analogous to the classical theory for random matrices over $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$. Such eigenvalue statistics were proposed as a model for the zeroes of $p$-adic $L$-functions by Ellenberg-Jain-Venkatesh, who computed the limiting distribution of the number of eigenvalues in a unit disc. We compute the full joint distribution of the $n$ eigenvalues of an $n \times n$ matrix with Haar distribution, obtaining Coulomb gas type formulas as in the archimedean case, with Vandermonde terms leading to eigenvalue repulsion. From these Coulomb gas density functions we derive asymptotics of eigenvalue statistics as $n \to \infty$. These include exact computations, such as a closed form $$ρ(x,y) = 1 - θ_3(-\sqrt{p};||x-y||^2/p)$$ for the limiting pair correlation of eigenvalues in $\mathbb{Z}_p$, and similar results in quadratic extensions. Such formulas yield concrete numerical predictions on zeroes of $p$-adic $L$-functions. For eigenvalues in arbitrary extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ we also give precise estimates on their pair-repulsion and expected number of eigenvalues in each extension. Finally, we compute the asymptotic probability that all eigenvalues lie in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Our proofs combine results from several distinct areas: $p$-adic orbital integrals, roots of random $p$-adic polynomials, the Sawin-Wood moment method for random modules, and Markov chains associated with measures on integer partitions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $S$ be a smooth irreducible curve over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, and let $\mathcal{A} \to S$ be an abelian scheme with a curve $C \subset \mathcal{A}$, both defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. In 2020, Barroero and Capuano proved that if $C$ is not contained in a proper subgroup scheme, then the intersection of $C$ with the union of the flat subgroup schemes of $\mathcal{A}$ of codimension at least 2 is finite. In this article, we continue to study this problem by considering the intersections with the algebraic subgroups of the CM fibers, generalizing a previous result of Barroero for fibered powers of elliptic schemes. A key ingredient of the proof is an explicit control of canonical heights under endomorphisms: for an abelian variety $A/\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, an ample symmetric divisor $D$, and $f \in \mathrm{End}(A)$, we bound explicitly $\widehat{h}_{A, D}(f(P))$ in terms of $\widehat{h}_{A, D}(P)$ by determining the values of $λ\in \mathbb{R}$ for which the divisors $λD - f^* D$ and $f^* D - λD$ are ample.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the thermodynamic formalism associated with the Schneider map on the p-adic integers $p\mathbb{Z}_p$ . By introducing a geometric potential that captures the expansion of cylinder sets generated by the map, we define a Lyapunov exponent adapted to this non-Archimedean setting. We investigate the corresponding Lyapunov spectrum and show that it is real analytic on its natural domain. Moreover, we obtain an explicit closed formula for the spectrum. As a consequence, we recover and refine known results on the Hausdorff dimension of sets defined by a prescribed asymptotic arithmetic mean of the continued fraction digits. Finally, we relate the Lyapunov exponent to the exponential rate of convergence of rational approximations arising from truncations of the Schneider continued fraction expansion. This provides a $p$-adic analogue of classical results from Diophantine approximation and yielding precise dimension formulas for the associated level sets.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the low degree $\ell$-adic intersection cohomology of symplectic local systems on the Satake compactification of the moduli space $A_g$ of principally polarized abelian varieties. We prove that only a small finite list of irreducible Galois representations can appear in the low degree cohomology of any nonsingular toroidal compactification of $A_g$ or $X_{g,s}$, the $s$-fold fiber product of the universal abelian variety. We give several applications, including to spaces of holomorphic forms on toroidal compactifications and to the cohomology of the interior. In particular, we give a complete characterization of when the cohomology of $X_{g,s}$, or one of its toroidal compactifications, is of Tate type. The result is independent of the choice of toroidal compactification.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that deformation rings $R^{\mathrm{ps}}$ of $G$-pseudocharacters of a profinite group $Γ$ are noetherian, when $Γ$ satisfies Mazur's finiteness condition. The proof proceeds by reduction to the case when $Γ$ is finitely generated, where the result was previously established by the second author. This enables us to extend our work on moduli spaces of $R^{\mathrm{ps}}$-condensed representations of a finitely generated profinite group $Γ$, to the groups satisfying Mazur's finiteness condition. We also show that the functor from rigid analytic spaces over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ to sets, which associates to a rigid space $Y$ the set of continuous $\mathcal{O}(Y)$-valued $G$-pseudocharacters of $Γ$ is representable by a quasi-Stein rigid analytic space, and we study its general properties. We expect these results to be useful, when studying global Galois representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a lattice/linear code, we define the Voronoi spherical cumulative density function (CDF) as the CDF of the $\ell_2$-norm/Hamming weight of a random vector uniformly distributed over the Voronoi cell. Using the first moment method together with a simple application of Jensen's inequality, we develop lower bounds on the expected Voronoi spherical CDF of a random lattice/linear code. Our bounds are valid for any finite dimension and are quite close to a trivial ball-based lower bound. They immediately translate to new non-asymptotic upper bounds on the normalized second moment and the error probability of a random lattice over the additive white Gaussian noise channel, as well as new non-asymptotic upper bounds on the Hamming distortion and the error probability of a random linear code over the binary symmetric channel. In particular, we show that for most lattices in $\mathbb{R}^n$ the second moment is greater than that of a Euclidean ball with the same covolume only by a $\left(1+O(\frac{1}{n})\right)$ multiplicative factor. Similarly, for most linear codes in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ the expected Hamming distortion is greater than that of a corresponding Hamming ball only by an additive universal constant.</p></details>

In the binary case, we show that under certain conditions, there are finitely many primitive positive definite ADC lattices and infinitely many non-primitive ones. We also provide concise formulas for local densities and masses using invariants from BONGs theory, and show that these invariants completely determine the local densities over arbitrary non-archimedean local fields. Moreover, we compute the corresponding local quantities for ADC lattices over algebraic number fields. In the ternary case, we characterize the codeterminant set of spinor exceptions and integral spinor norm groups for ADC lattices over arbitrary non-archimedean local fields. Based on these results, we further establish some sufficient conditions on indefinite ADC lattices over algebraic number fields.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>About a century ago, P. A. MacMahon introduced a class of $q$-series, which are nowadays referred to as MacMahon series. More recently, in 2013, G. E. Andrews and S. C. F. Rose revealed the quasimodular property of these series. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of MacMahon series. Specifically, for any positive integers $t, k, N$ and a polynomial $Q(x)$, we define the series $\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}(Q; q)$ and $\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}^{\star}(Q; q)$ using the $N$-th cyclotomic polynomial. To investigate these series, we apply a decomposition formula involving the Eulerian polynomials and express the $N$-th roots of unity in terms of Gauss sums. By combining these results to derive explicit representations, we prove that our series arise as quasimodular forms of higher weight and higher level. Furthermore, we show that they can be expressed as isobaric polynomials. In particular, we show that the one-parameter generalization introduced by C. Nazaroglu, B. V. Pandey, and A. Singh arises as a special case of our theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We initiate a program aimed at classifying thick ideals, Balmer spectra, and submodule categories of various stable categories of bimodules and modules for finite dimensional selfinjective algebras, and at clarifying the relationship between the universal Balmer support and the Hochschild cohomology support. In this paper, we focus mostly on the case of a unipotent Hopf algebra $A$. The stable category $\underline{\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\mathsf{env}})$ of $A$-bimodules that are projective as left and as right $A$-modules is a monoidal triangulated category under $\otimes_A$, and acts naturally on the stable category $\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A)$ of $A$. We show in this case that the Balmer spectrum $\mathsf{Spc}(\mathcal{E})$ of the thick subcategory ${\mathcal E}$ of $\underline{\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\mathsf{env}})$ generated by $A$ is homeomorphic to $\mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A))$ and defines an embedding $\mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A)) \to \mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A^{\mathsf{env}}))$. Subject to a conjectural description of spectra of finite tensor categories, we show that the spectrum of ${\mathcal E}$ is homeomorphic to ${\mathsf{Proj}}$ of the Hochschild cohomology ring of $A$, and that the Hochschild support coincides with the universal Balmer support. We show that any subcategory ${\mathcal K}$ of $\underline{\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\mathsf{env}})$ containing a thick generator admits a surjective continuous map from $\mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A))$. As a consequence, under the aforementioned conjecture, this spectrum is Noetherian, classifies the thick ideals of ${\mathcal K}$, and classifies thick ${\mathcal K}$-submodule categories of $\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A)$ via the Stevenson module-theoretic support. As examples, we present in detail the representations of finite $p$-groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove explicit Erdős--Wintner bounds for Cantor numeration systems via a simple trailing-window decomposition. We temporarily discard the last block of digits (the ``window'') and analyze the remaining prefix. The resulting bound has three contributions: (i) a bridge loss from discarding the window; (ii) a variance-type tail for the prefix; and (iii) a regime-dependent smoothing term (Esseen, bounded density, or cancellation of the third cumulant). Optimizing the window length yields rates that are explicit in the sample size. In the fixed-base (q-adic) case we recover Delange's product and obtain effective convergence bounds; the same scheme applies unchanged to Cantor numeration systems. We also include a brief guide indicating when each regime is preferable.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We take first steps toward a theory of ``conformal twists'' for superconformal field theories in dimension 3 to 6, extending the well-known analysis of twists for supersymmetric theories. A conformal twist is a square-zero odd element in the superconformal Lie algebra, and we classify all twists and describe their orbits under the adjoint action of the superconformal group. We work mostly with the complexified superconformal algebras, unless explicitly stated otherwise; real forms of the superconformal algebra may have important physical implications, but we only discuss these subtleties in a few special cases. Conformal twists can give rise to interesting subalgebras and protected sectors of operators in a superconformal field theory, with the Donaldson--Witten topological field theory and the vertex operator algebras of 4-dimensional N=2 SCFTs being prominent examples. To obtain mathematical precision, we explain how to extract vertex algebras and E_n algebras from a twisted superconformal field theory using factorization algebras.</p></details>

Moreover, we simplify the analogous computation for diagonal classes, relying on a pullback construction inspired by recent work of Sangiovanni-Vincentelli--Skinner.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Caleb Kennedy Hill &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give graphical presentations for the two quantum subgroups of type $G_2$. To do this we use a method of extending a tensor category by embedding the planar algebra of a $\otimes$-generating object into the graph planar algebra of this object's fundamental graph. This allows the use of computational methods to uncover relations we would have little hope of arriving at otherwise.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we derive better results concerning powered numbers in short intervals, both unconditionally and conditionally on the $abc$-conjecture. We make use of sieve method, a polynomial identity, and a recent breakthrough result on density of sets with no $k$-term arithmetic progression. In the process, we study integers over short intervals that have with a big smooth divisor.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** George Petroulakis &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article introduces a framework for the localization and isolation of singularities in the affine Grassmannian. Our primary result is a structural factorization of the transition matrix $C$ between the Mirković--Vilonen (MV) basis and the convolution basis into $C = P \cdot M \cdot A \cdot Q^{-1}$, where the four factors represent: equivariant localization ($Q$), fusion via nearby cycles ($A$), local intersection cohomology stalks ($M$), and diagonal normalization ($P$). Utilizing this factorization, and by introducing the Geometric Efficiency metric ($η$) we establish a Universal Geometric Rank Bound, proving that the rank of the transition matrix $C$ is bounded by the dimension of the local Braden--MacPherson (BMP) stalks.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show the vanishing of higher extension groups and torsion groups between linearisation of additive functors from a semi-additive category satisfying some conditions to a category of vector spaces. In particular, we apply our results to the category of correspondences functors of Bouc-Thévenaz.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we calculate the Hochschild cohomology of graded skew-gentle algebras, together with its structure as graded commutative algebra under the cup product and its Lie algebra structure given by the Gerstenhaber bracket. One of the results of this paper is that for graded skew-gentle algebras and thus also for partially wrapped Fukaya categories of orbifold surfaces with stops, their Hochschild cohomology is encoded in the underlying graded surface.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article we study the value distribution theory for the first derivative of the logarithmic derivative of Dirichlet $L$-functions, generalizing certain results of Ihara, Matsumoto et. al. related to ``$M$-functions" for $σ= $ Re$(s) > 1$. We then discuss how things evolve for higher derivatives.</p></details>
