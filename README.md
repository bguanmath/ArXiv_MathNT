### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03702v1'>2511.03702</a>\]&nbsp; **A non-iterative straightening algorithm and orthogonality for skew Schur modules**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Reuven Hodges, Hanzhang Yin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 32 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We generalize Fulton's determinantal construction of Schur modules to the skew setting, providing an explicit and functorial presentation using only elementary linear algebra and determinantal identities, in parallel with the partition case. Building on the non-iterative straightening formula of the first author for partition shapes, we develop a non-iterative straightening algorithm for skew Schur modules that expresses arbitrary elements in a new D-basis with an explicit closed coefficient formula. We then show that this D-basis is the result of applying Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to the semistandard tableau basis, which identifies a natural inner product on the skew Schur module and recasts straightening as an orthogonal projection.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct stable geometric and spectral transfer factors for a general reductive group and develop some of their basic properties, assuming the refined local Langlands correspondence. Using our definition of stable geometric transfer factors, we show that the stable transfer conjecture for orbital integrals implies the stable transfer of characters and vice versa. The latter is also implied by local Langlands, and in particular this establishes archimedean stable geometric transfer. Finally, we show how the stable geometric transfer factors can be used to define stable spectral transfer factors.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ádám Gyenge, Timothy Logvinenko &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 53 pages; v1

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We decategorify the Heisenberg 2-category of Gyenge-Koppensteiner-Logvinenko using Hochschild homology. We use this to generalise the Heisenberg algebra action of Grojnowski and Nakajima to all smooth and proper noncommutative varieties in the noncommutative geometry setting proposed by Kontsevich and Soibelman. For ordinary commutative varieties, we compute the resulting action on Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology. As tools, we prove results about Heisenberg algebras of a graded vector space which might be of independent interest.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Theodoulos Garefalakis, Giorgos Kapetanakis &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Denote by $\mathbb F_q$ the finite field of order $q$ and by $\mathbb F_{q^n}$ its extension of degree $n$. Some $a\in\mathbb F_{q^n}$ is called primitive if it generates the multiplicative group $\mathbb F_{q^n}^*$ and it is called $q^n/q$-normal if its $\mathbb F_q$-conjugates form an $\mathbb F_q$-basis of $\mathbb F_{q^n}$ if the latter is viewed as an $\mathbb F_q$-vector space. Furthermore, some $a\in\mathbb F_{q^n}$ is called $q^n/q$-completely normal if it is $q^n/q^d$-normal for all $d\mid n$. In this work we prove a new construction of sets of completely normal elements and, we establish, under conditions, the existence of elements that are simultaneously primitive and $q^n/q$-completely normal, covering some yet unresolved cases of a 30-year-old conjecture by Morgan and Mullen.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 6 pages; v2, ref added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We find an intriguing relation between the chiral algebra and the mixed Hodge structure of the Coulomb branch of four dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 2$ superconformal field theories. We identify the space of irreducible characters of the $\mathcal{N} = 4$ $SU(N)$ chiral algebra $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$ by analytically computing the Wilson line Schur index, and imposing modular invariance. We further establish a map from the $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$ characters to the characters of the $\mathcal{T}_{p, N}$ chiral algebra. We extract the pure part of the mixed Hodge polynomial $PH_c$ of the Coulomb branch compactified on a circle, and prove that $PH_c$ encodes the representation theory of $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$. We expect this to be a new entry of the 4D mirror symmetry framework.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27603v2'>2510.27603</a>\]&nbsp; **The Skolem Problem in rings of positive characteristic**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ruiwen Dong, Doron Shafrir &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** cs.LO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 14 pages, minor changes and corrected typos

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the Skolem Problem is decidable in finitely generated commutative rings of positive characteristic. More precisely, we show that there exists an algorithm which, given a finite presentation of a (unitary) commutative ring $\mathcal{R} = \mathbb{Z}_{/T}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]/I$ of characteristic $T > 0$, and a linear recurrence sequence $(\gamma_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in \mathcal{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$, determines whether $(\gamma_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ contains a zero term. Our proof is based on two recent results: Dong and Shafrir (2025) on the solution set of S-unit equations over $p^e$-torsion modules, and Karimov, Luca, Nieuwveld, Ouaknine, and Worrell (2025) on solving linear equations over powers of two multiplicatively independent numbers. Our result implies, moreover, that the zero set of a linear recurrence sequence over a ring of characteristic $T = p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is effectively a finite union of $p_i$-normal sets in the sense of Derksen (2007).</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15809v2'>2307.15809</a>\]&nbsp; **The Kudla-Millson lift of Siegel cusp forms**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Paul Kiefer, Riccardo Zuffetti &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 63 pages, paper shape modified for clearer exposition, few technical proofs simplified, main results unchanged. To be published in Compositio Mathematica

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the injectivity of the Kudla-Millson lift of genus 2 Siegel cusp forms, vector-valued with respect to the Weil representation associated to an even lattice L. We prove that if L splits off two hyperbolic planes and is of sufficiently large rank, then the lift is injective. As an application, we deduce that the image of the lift in the degree 4 cohomology of the associated orthogonal Shimura variety has the same dimension as the lifted space of cusp forms. Our results also cover the case of moduli spaces of quasi-polarized K3 surfaces. To prove the injectivity, we introduce vector-valued indefinite Siegel theta functions of genus 2 and of Jacobi type attached to L. We describe their behavior with respect to the split of a hyperbolic plane in L. This generalizes results of Borcherds to genus higher than 1.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Mahdi Ebrahimi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given an positive integer $k$, let $n:=\binom{k+1}{2}$. In 2012, during a talk at UCLA, Jan Saxl conjectured that all irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ occur in the decomposition of the tensor square of the irreducible representation corresponding to the staircase partition. In this paper, we investigate two useful methods to obtain some irreducible representations that occur in this decomposition. Our main tolls are the semi-group property for Kronecker coefficients and generalized blocks of symmetric groups.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Xiaoyu Qu, Jiahong Yu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Consider a bounded prism $(A,I)$ and a bounded quasi-l.c.i algebra $R$ over $\overline{A}$. In this paper, for any prism $S/A$ with a surjection $S\to R$ such that $\widehat{\mathbb L}_{\overline{S}/\overline{A}}$ is a $p$-completely flat module over $\overline{S}$, we establish an equivalence of categories between rational Hodge-Tate crystals on $(R/A)_{\Delta}$ and topologically nilpotent integrable connections on the Hodge--Tate cohomology ring $\overline{\Delta}_{R/S}$. As an application, for a non-zero divisor $a\in \overline{A}$, we introduce the concept of $a$-smallness for a rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystal on $(R/A)_{\Delta}$. Finally, we focus on some special algebras $R$ over $\mathcal O_{\mathbb C_p}$ (or generally, the ring of integers of an algebraic closed and complete non-archimedean field) including all $p$-completely smooth algebras, $p$-complete algebras with semi-stable reductions and geometric valuation rings. By using our equivalence, we analyze the restriction functor from the category of $a$-small rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystals to the category of $v$-vector bundles. This yields some new results in $p$-adic non-abelian Hodge Theory.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Anwesh Ray, Tanushree Shah &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Version 1: 29 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical analogy between knots and primes motivates the study of Alexander polynomials through an arithmetic perspective. In this article we study the two-parameter family of torus knots and links $T_{p,q}$ and analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the zeros of their Alexander polynomials $\Delta_{p,q}(t)$, defined with respect to the total linking number covering. We prove that as $p,q\to\infty$ these zeros become equidistributed on the unit circle and derive an explicit formula for the limiting frequency with which primitive $r$-th roots of unity appear. To capture finer statistical information, we introduce the moment sequence of the zero distribution and compute its generating function in closed form. We further examine the Iwasawa theory of the corresponding branched covers, determining the Iwasawa invariants. The logarithmic Mahler measure of $\Delta_{p,q}(t)$ vanishes identically and the associated homological growth in towers of abelian covers of $S^3$ branched along $T_{p,q}$ is subexponential.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kwang-Wu Chen &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 17 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study two families of zeta-like multiple series -- the multiple $\rho$-values and the multiple $\eta$-values -- defined by nested sums with shifted denominators. An explicit factorial formula for $\rho$ reveals its intrinsic combinatorial structure and leads to closed expressions for fixed weight and depth. A remarkable identity emerges from a weighted-sum transformation, exhibiting a perfect discrete balance. The main theorem proves that the total sums of $\rho$- and $\eta$-values coincide for equal weight but complementary depths. This correspondence provides an analytic basis for integral representations of $\eta$-values and for deriving weighted sum relations. Together, these results show that the $\rho$- and $\eta$-families form two complementary realizations of a unified analytic-combinatorial structure, bridging factorial and harmonic formulations in zeta-like multiple sums.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 43 pages, including a 10-page introduction

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\Psi(x,y)$ denote the count of $y$-smooth numbers below $x$ and $P(n)$ denote the largest prime factor of $n$. We prove that for $f$ a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, the partial sums over $y$-smooth numbers enjoy better than squareroot cancellation, in the sense that $$ \mathbb E \Big|\sum_{\substack{1\leq n \leq x\\ P(n) \leq y}} f(n) \Big| = o\left( \Psi(x,y)^{1/2} \right),$$ uniformly for $(\log x)^{30} \leq y \leq x$. Our bounds are quantitative and give a large saving when $y$ isn't too close to $x$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zhichao Chen, Zelin Jia &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 38 pages, 10 figures. All comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The generalized Markov equations are deeply connected with the generalized cluster algebras of Markov type. We construct a deformed Fock-Goncharov tropicalization for the generalized Markov equations and prove that their tropicalized tree structure is essentially the same as that of the classical Euclid tree. We then define the generalized Euclid tree and prove that it converges to the classical Euclid tree up to a scalar multiple. Moreover, by means of cluster mutations, we exhibit an asymptotic phenomenon, up to some limit q, between the logarithmic generalized Markov tree and the classical Euclid tree. A rationality conjecture of q is then put forward. We also propose a generalized Markov uniqueness conjecture for the generalized Markov equations, which illustrates an application of the asymptotic phenomenon.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Edmund Karasiewicz, Shuichiro Takeda &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct some Iwahori types, in the sense of Bushnell-Kutzko, for the double cover of an almost simple simply-laced simply-connected Chevalley group $\widetilde{G}$ over any $2$-adic field. These types capture the covering group analog of the Bernstein block of unramified principal series. We also prove that the associated Hecke algebra essentially admits an Iwahori-Matsumoto (IM) presentation. The complete presentation is obtained for types $A_{r}$, $D_{2r+1}$, $E_{6}$, $E_{7}$; for the other types, some technical obstacles remain. Those Hecke algebras with the complete IM presentation are isomorphic to Iwahori-Hecke algebras of explicit linear Chevalley groups, giving rise to Shimura correspondences. Along the way, we show that the Iwahori type extends to a hyperspecial maximal compact subgroup $\widetilde{K}\subseteq \widetilde{G}$. This extension has minimal depth among the genuine $\widetilde{K}$-representations and allows us to construct a finite Shimura correspondence, generalizing a result of Savin.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tal Gottesman, Viktória Klász, Markus Kleinau, Rene Marczinzik &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent article, Iyama and Marczinzik showed that a lattice is distributive if and only if the incidence algebra is Auslander regular, giving a new connection between homological algebra and lattice theory. In this article we study when a distributive lattice has a pure minimal injective coresolution, a notion first introduced and studied in a work of Ajitabh, Smith and Zhang. We will see that this problem naturally leads to studying when certain antichain modules are perfect modules. We give a classification of perfect antichain modules under the assumption that their canonical antichain resolution is minimal and use this to give a completion classification in lattice theoretic terms of incidence algebras of distributive lattices with pure minimal injective coresolution.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove analogues of the theorem of Green and Tao on linear constellations in primes, in which the primes under consideration are restricted by certain arithmetic conditions. Our first main result is conditional upon Hooley's Riemann hypothesis and imposes the extra condition that the primes have prescribed primitive roots. Our second main result is unconditional and imposes the extra condition that the primes have prescribed Artin symbols in given Galois number fields. In the appendix we present an application of the second result in inverse Galois theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Jarossay introduced adjoint multiple zeta values, and he found $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic relations among adjoint multiple zeta values, referred to as the \emph{adjoint double shuffle relations}, by using Racinet's dual formulation of the generating series of multiple zeta values. Jarossay defined the affine scheme $\mathrm{AdDMR}_0$ determined by the adjoint double shuffle relations and posed a question whether $\mathrm{AdDMR}_0$ is isomorphic to Racinet's double shuffle group $\mathrm{DMR}_0$. In this paper, we refine Jarossay's question by formulating what we call the adjoint conditions and by addressing its Lie algebraic side. Within this framework, we construct the Lie algebra associated with the adjoint double shuffle relations by imposing Hirose's parity results.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This work is the second in a series, following Part I (Algebra Number Theory 18.10 (2024)) and preceding Part III (Math. Ann. 391.1 (2025)). We continue our investigation of spectral moments of $\hbox{GL}(3)\times \hbox{GL}(2)$ $\hbox{L}$-functions from the perspective of period integrals. Using an identity between two distinct periods for the $\hbox{GL}(3)$ Eisenstein series, we establish an exact Motohashi-type identity linking the shifted cubic moment of $\hbox{GL}(2)$ $\hbox{L}$-functions to the shifted fourth moment of $\hbox{GL}(1)$ $\hbox{L}$-functions. In addition, we offer a novel, intrinsic and automorphic account for the sources and symmetries of the full set of main terms for both moments, in agreement with the CFKRS Moment Conjectures (Proc. Lond. Math. Soc.(3) 91 (2005)).</p></details>

Such an $x_0$ is called a St{\o}rmer number, named after the Norwegian mathematician and astronomer Carl St{\o}rmer (1874-1957). In this paper, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for $x_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ to be a St{\o}rmer number of some prime $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$. St{\o}rmer's main interest in his investigations of St{\o}rmer numbers stemmed from his study of identities expressing $\pi$ as finite linear combinations of certain values of the Gregory-MacLaurin series for $\arctan(1/x)$. Since less than 600 digits of $\pi$ were known by 1900, approximating $\pi$ was an important topic. One such identity, discovered by St{\o}rmer in 1896, was used by Yasumasa Kanada and his team in 2002 to obtain 1.24 trillion digits of $\pi$. We also discuss St{\o}rmer's work on connecting these numbers to Gregory numbers and approximations of $\pi$. \u</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Kronecker observed that either all roots or only one root of a solvable irreducible equation of odd prime degree with integer coefficients are real. This gives a possibility to construct specific examples of equations not solvable by radicals. A relatively elementary proof without using the full power of Galois theory is due to Weber. We give a rather short proof of Kronecker's theorem with a slightly different argument from Weber's. Several modern presentations of Weber's proof contain inaccuracies, which can be traced back to an error in the original proof. We discuss this error and how it can be corrected.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper studies a basic Markov chain, the Burnside process, on the space of flags $G/B$ with $G = GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $B$ its upper triangular matrices. This gives rise to a shuffling: a Markov chain on the symmetric group realized via the Bruhat decomposition. Actually running and describing this Markov chain requires understanding Springer fibers and the Steinberg variety. The main results give a practical algorithm for all n and q and determine the limiting behavior of the chain when q is large. In describing this behavior, we find interesting connections to the combinatorics of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence and to the geometry of orbital varieties. The construction and description is then carried over to finite Chevalley groups of arbitrary type, describing a new class of Markov chains on Weyl groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\nu$ be any positive function such that $\nu(x)\to\infty$ as $x\to \infty$. We prove that for almost all fundamental discriminants $d$, $L'(s, \chi_d)$ has at most $(\log\log |d|)( \log\log \log |d|)$ real zeros inside the interval $[1/2+\nu(|d|)/\log |d|, 1]$. Combining this result with a recent work of Klurman, Lamzouri, and Munsch, shows that the number of these zeros equals $(\log\log |d|) (\log\log \log |d|)^{\theta}$ for almost all $d$, where $|\theta|\leq 1$. This comes close to proving a conjecture of Baker and Montgomery, which predicts $\asymp \log\log |d|$ real zeros of $L'(s, \chi_d)$ in the interval $[1/2, 1]$, for almost all $d$. Moreover, assuming a mild hypothesis on the low lying zeros of quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions (which follows from GRH and the one level density conjecture of Katz and Sarnak), we fully resolve the Baker-Montgomery conjecture (up to the $\log\log\log |d|$ factor). We also show, under the same hypothesis, that for almost all $d$, $100\%$ of the real zeros of $L'(s, \chi_d)$ on $[1/2, 1]$ lie to the right of $1/2+\nu(|d|)/\log |d|$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we discuss an alternative approach to determine an asymptotic equivalent of the partial sum of the reciprocals of prime numbers. This well-known result, related to Merten's second theorem, is usually derived through methods similar to those found in Hardy and Wright's book ``An introduction to the theory of numbers'', involving comparisons with integrals. The present proof differs in several respects, combining an equivalent for the partial sum of $\Lambda(m)/m$, where $\Lambda$ denotes the von Mangoldt function, with an application of Abel's summation formula and properties of the second Chebyshev function $\Psi(x)=\sum_{n\le x}\Lambda(n)$. A simple application to the study of integers with large prime factors is also presented. Beyond the pedagogical aspect of this work, the aim is to highlight the complementarity of arithmetic functions and to show that interesting (and nontrivial) results can be obtained by means of elementary methods.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a general method to study representations of quivers over abstract stable homotopy theories (e.g. arbitrary rings, schemes, dg algebras, or ring spectra) in terms of Auslander-Reiten diagrams. For a finite acyclic quiver $Q$ and a stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, we prove an abstract equivalence of the representations $\mathcal{C}^Q$ with a certain mesh $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{Z}Q,\, \mathrm{mesh}}$ of representations of the repetitive quiver $\mathbb{Z}Q$, that we build inductively using abstract reflection functors. This allows to produce, from the symmetries of the Auslander-Reiten quiver, universal autoequivalences of representations $\mathcal{C}^Q$ in any stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, which are the elements of the spectral Picard group of $Q$. In particular, we get abstract versions of key functors in classical representation theory -- e.g. reflection functors, the Auslander-Reiten translation, the Serre functor, etc. Moreover, for representations of trees this enables us to realize the whole derived Picard group over a field as a factor of the spectral Picard group.</p></details>

Equivalently, we show that the tagged skein algebra $Sk^{ta}(\Sigma)$, or the middle cluster algebra $\mathrm{mid}(\mathcal{A})$, coincides with the upper cluster algebra $U(\Sigma)$. Inspired by the work of Shen--Sun--Weng, we introduce the localized cluster variety $\mathring{\mathcal{A}}$ as the algebraic version of the decorated Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}^d(\Sigma)$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the existence and give a classification of all $d$-tilting bundles (and thus geometric Helices) consisting of line bundles on $d$-dimensional smooth toric Fano DM stacks of Picard number one or two. Here, a $d$-tilting bundle is a tilting bundle whose endomorphism algebra has global dimension $d$ or less. In the case of Picard number one, tilting bundles consisting of line bundles correspond bijectively to non-trivial upper sets in its Picard group equipped with a certain partial order. Moreover, all of them are $d$-tilting bundles and their endomorphisms algebras become $d$-representation infinite algebras of type $\tilde{A}$. Conversely, all such algebras arise in this way. In this sense, we can think of smooth toric Fano DM stacks with Picard number one as geometric models of higher representation infinite algebras of type $\tilde{A}$. Using this geometric model, we give a new combinatorial description to $d$-APR tilting modules of them. In the case of Picard number two, $d$-tilting bundles consisting of line bundles correspond bijectively to pairs $(I,I')$, where $I$ and $I'$ are non-trivial upper sets in certain partially ordered sets. Here, $I$ corresponds to a non-commutative crepant resolution (NCCR) of a certain Gorenstein toric singularity with divisor class group of rank one and $I'$ corresponds to a cut of the quiver of this NCCR. Moreover, the endomorphism algebras of these $d$-tilting bundles also become $d$-representation infinite algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $L/K$ be a cyclic extension of number fields, and let $S$ be a finite set of places of $K$ containing the ramified and Archimedean ones. We say that $L/K$ has the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property if, for any generator $\sigma \in \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$, the kernel of the arithmetic norm map $\mathbf{cl}^S(L) \to \mathbf{cl}^S(K)$ coincides with $(1 - \sigma)\mathbf{cl}^S(L)$. In this article, we first provide a method to verify the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property, which does not require any knowledge of the class group of $L$. Then we investigate a connection between the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property and the Gross-Kuz'min conjecture from Iwasawa theory. In doing so, we derive a new criterion for the Gross-Kuz'min conjecture, related to Fermat quotients and spin symbols of prime ideals, which can easily be checked by explicit computation. We conjecture that, in the totally real case, the condition holds for all but finitely many primes. Finally, we present numerical evidence supporting a heuristic in favor of this conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1878, Sylvester proved Cayley's Conjecture that the coefficients of the Gaussian $q$-binomial coefficients are unimodal. In 1990, O'Hara famously discovered a constructive combinatorial proof, and in 2013, Pak and Panova proved the stronger property of strict unimodality for sufficiently large parameters. We move from unimodality to log-concavity and higher degree $ d$ log-concavity, known as Tur\'an inequalities. Although $q$-binomial coefficients are not always log- or degree $d$ log-concave, it's natural to ask to what extent these inequalities hold. In infinite families with limiting aspect ratio bounded away from zero and one, we prove that these stronger inequalities hold uniformly, for each $C>0,$ on the central window $|m-\mu|< C\sigma,$ where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation of the normalized distribution. More generally, we obtain the same conclusions for $q$-multinomial coefficients. These results stem from the asymptotic behavior of normalized Jensen polynomials, which are approximated by Hermite polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a curve of genus at least four which is either very general or very general hyperelliptic, we classify all ways in which a power of its Jacobian can be isogenous to a product of Jacobians of curves. As an application, we show that, for a very general principally polarized abelian variety of dimension at least four, or the intermediate Jacobian of a very general cubic threefold, no power is isogenous to a product of Jacobians of curves. This confirms some cases of the Coleman-Oort conjecture. We further deduce from our results some progress on the question whether the integral Hodge conjecture fails for such abelian varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a field, fix an algebraic closure $\overline{K}$, and let $G$ be a subgroup of $\overline{K}^\times$. We are able to give a closed formula for the ratio between the degree $[K(G):K]$ and the index $|GK^\times:K^\times|$, provided that the latter is finite. Our formula explains all the $K$-linear relations among radicals, which (beyond the ones stemming from the multiplicative group $GK^\times/K^\times$) are generated by relations among roots of unity and single radicals. Our work builds on results by Rybowicz, which in turn are based on work by Kneser and Schinzel.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The orbital bivariate chromatic polynomial, introduced in this article, counts the number of ways to color the vertices of a graph with $\lambda$ colors such that adjacent vertices either receive distinct colors from a set of $\lambda$ colors, or the same color from a distinguished subset of $\lambda-\mu$ colors, up to a group of symmetries. This new graph polynomial simultaneously generalizes the orbital chromatic polynomial due to Cameron and Kayibi (2007) and the bivariate chromatic polynomial due to Dohmen, P\"onitz, and Tittmann (2003). We discuss fundamental properties, and provide expansions of this new polynomial for various families of graphs, including complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, paths, and cycles. Some of these expansions are even new for the orbital chromatic polynomial. In addition to these results, we rediscover Fermat's Little Theorem and a ``Fermat-like'' congruence for Lucas numbers. Finally, we outline several open problems related to the orbital bivariate chromatic polynomial.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(X, d)$ be a compact metric space. Given a countable subset $Q \subset X$, a positive function $R: Q \to \mathbb{R}^+:\xi \mapsto R_{\xi}$, and a non-decreasing function $\phi$, we consider the set $E(Q, R, \phi)$ of points $x \in X$ for which there are infinitely many $\xi \in Q$ satisfying $$d(x, \xi) < \phi(R_{\xi}),$$ yet for any $0<\epsilon<1$, there are only finitely many $\xi \in Q$ such that $$d(x, \xi) < (1-\epsilon)\phi(R_{\xi}).$$ We provide sufficient conditions (which are also necessary under some mild assumptions) for the $s$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of $E(Q, R, \phi)$ to be infinite. This framework generalizes not only the classical set $\mathrm{Exact}(\psi)$ of points exactly $\psi$-approximable by rationals (where $\psi$ is non-increasing), but also certain restricted Diophantine approximation sets.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathrm{OD}_{n}$ be the monoid of all order-preserving functions and order-reversing functions on the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. We describe a quiver presentation for the monoid algebra $\Bbbk\mathrm{OD}_{n}$ where $\Bbbk$ is a field whose characteristic is not 2. We show that the quiver consists of two straightline paths, one with $n-1$ vertices and one with $n$ vertices, and that all compositions of consecutive arrows are equal to $0$. As part of the proof we obtain a complete description of all homomorphisms between induced left Sch\"utzenberger modules of $\Bbbk\mathrm{OD}_{n}$. We also define $\mathrm{COD}_{n}$ to be a covering of $\mathrm{OD}_{n}$ with an artificial distinction between order-preserving and order-reversing constant functions. We show that $\mathrm{COD}_{n}\simeq\mathrm{O}_{n}\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ where $\mathrm{O}_{n}$ is the monoid of all order-preserving functions on the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. Moreover, if $\Bbbk$ is a field whose characteristic is not $2$ we prove that $\Bbbk\mathrm{COD}_{n}\simeq\Bbbk\mathrm{O}_{n}\times\Bbbk\mathrm{O}_{n}$. As a corollary, we deduce that the quiver of $\Bbbk\mathrm{COD}_{n}$ consists of two straightline paths with n vertices, and that all compositions of consecutive arrows are equal to $0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the quantum affine general linear superalgebra $\mathrm{U}_q\big(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{m|n,\mathbf{s}}\big)$ for arbitrary 01-sequences $\mathbf{s}$, using the RTT presentation. We systematically construct the RTT presentation for quantum general linear superalgebra $\mathrm{U}_q\big(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n,\mathbf{s}}\big)$, and derive a PBW basis induced by the action of the braid group, compatible with non-standard parities. We determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for the finite-dimensionality of irreducible representations of $\mathrm{U}_q\big(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n,\mathbf{s}}\big)$ and extend the results to the affine case via the evaluation homomorphism. Specific cases such as $(m,n)=(1,1)$ demonstrate that all finite-dimensional representations are tensor products of typical evaluation representations. This work extends existing representation frameworks and classification methods to encompass arbitrary 01-sequences, establishing the foundation for subsequent research on representations of quantum affine superalgebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this short note, we work in the general framework of supersingular abelian varieties defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. Using Coleman maps constructed by B\"uy\"ukboduk--Lei, we define some objects called ``the multi-signed Mordell-Weil groups" for supersingular abelian varieties, make comments on the structure of the dual of these groups as an Iwasawa module and show a (weak) control theorem. This recovers the case of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ non-ordinary at the prime $p$ with $a_p=0$ studied by Antonio Lei. Using the multi-signed Mordell-Weil groups we define what we call ``the multi-signed Tate-Shafarevich groups" along the cyclotomic tower of $\mathbb{Q}$. Finally we pose some open questions related to our newly defined objects and make a remark on the asymptotic growth of these multi-signed Tate-Shafarevich groups along the cyclotomic tower using an idea of Meng Fai Lim.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article concerns the computational complexity of a fundamental problem in number theory: counting points on curves and surfaces over finite fields. There is no subexponential-time algorithm known and it is unclear if it can be $\mathrm{NP}$-hard. Given a curve, we present the first efficient Arthur-Merlin protocol to certify its point-count, its Jacobian group structure, and its Hasse-Weil zeta function. We extend this result to a smooth projective surface to certify the factor $P_{1}(T)$, corresponding to the first Betti number, of the zeta function; by using the counting oracle. We give the first algorithm to compute $P_{1}(T)$ that is poly($\log q$)-time if the degree $D$ of the input surface is fixed; and in quantum poly($D\log q$)-time in general. Our technique in the curve case, is to sample hash functions using the Weil and Riemann-Roch bounds, to certify the group order of its Jacobian. For higher dimension varieties, we first reduce to the case of a surface, which is fibred as a Lefschetz pencil of hyperplane sections over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. The formalism of vanishing cycles, and the inherent big monodromy, enable us to prove an effective version of Deligne's `theoreme du pgcd' using the hard-Lefschetz theorem and an equidistribution result due to Katz. These reduce our investigations to that of computing the zeta function of a curve, defined over a finite field extension $\mathbb{F}_{Q}/\mathbb{F}_{q}$ of poly-bounded degree. This explicitization of the theory yields the first nontrivial upper bounds on the computational complexity.</p></details>

This result extends one of the main results of Corvaja-Zannier \cite{corv}. In addition, we prove a result similar to \cite[Theorem 1.4]{kul} in a more general setting.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Robin criterion states that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the inequality $\sigma(n) < e^\gamma n \log \log n$ for all $n>5040$, where $\sigma(n)$ is the sum of divisors of $n$, and $\gamma$ is the Euler--Mascheroni constant. Define the family of functions $$ \sigma^{[k]} (n):=\sum_{[d_1,\dots,d_k]=n}d_1\dots d_k $$ where $[d_1, \dots, d_k]$ is the least common multiple of $d_1, \dots, d_k$. These functions behave asymptotically like $\sigma(n)^k$ as $k\to\infty$. We prove the following analogue of the Robin criterion: for any $k \geq 2$, the Riemann hypothesis holds if and only if $\sigma^{[k]} (n) < \frac{(e^\gamma n \log \log n)^k}{\zeta(k)}$ for all $n > 2162160$, where $\zeta$ is the Riemann zeta function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove two results on converse theorems for Hilbert modular forms over totally real fields of degree $r>1$. The first result recovers a Hilbert modular form (of some level) from an $L$-series satisfying functional equations twisted by all the unramified Hecke characters. The second result assumes both the 'unramified' functional equations and an Euler product, and recovers a Hilbert modular form of the expected level predicted by the shape of the functional equations. Our result generalizes the current converse theorems for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ in the case of Hilbert modular forms in that we completely remove the assumptions on ramified twists.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by Stanley's generalization of the chromatic polynomial of a graph to the chromatic symmetric function, we introduce the characteristic polynomial of a representation of the symmetric group, or more generally, of a symmetric function. When the representation arises from geometry, the coefficients of its characteristic polynomial tend to form a log-concave sequence. To illustrate, we investigate explicit examples, including the $n$-fold products of the projective spaces, the GIT moduli spaces of points on $\mathbb{P}^1$ and Hessenberg varieties. Our main focus lies on the cohomology of the moduli space of pointed rational curves, for which we prove asymptotic formulas of its characteristic polynomial and establish asymptotic log-concavity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime number and $n$ a positive integer. Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over a number field $k$. It is known that the local-global divisibility by $p$ holds in $E/k$, but for powers of $p^n$ counterexamples may appear. The validity or the failing of the Hasse principle depends on the elliptic curve $E$ and the field $k$ and, consequently, on the group $\mathrm{Gal}(k(E[p^n])/k)$. For which kind of these groups does the principle hold? For which of them can we find a counterexample? The answer to these questions was known for $n=1,2$, but for $n\geq 3$ they were still open. We show some conditions on the generators of $\mathrm{Gal}(k(E[p^n])/k)$ implying an affirmative answer to the local-global divisibility by $p^n$ in $E$ over $k$, for every $n\geq 2$. We also prove that these conditions are necessary by producing counterexamples in the case when they do not hold. These last results generalize to every power $p^n$, a result obtained by Ranieri for $n=2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We classify periodic $Y$-systems of rank 2 satisfying the symplectic property. We find that there are six such $Y$-systems. In all cases, the periodicity follows from the existence of two reddening sequences associated with the time evolution of the $Y$-systems in positive and negative directions, which gives rise to quantum dilogarithm identities associated with Donaldson-Thomas invariants. We also consider $q$-series called the Nahm sums associated with these $Y$-systems. We see that they are included in Zagier's list of rank 2 Nahm sums that are likely to be modular functions. It was recently shown by Wang that they are indeed modular functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Inspired by equivariant homotopy theory, equivariant algebra studies generalisations of G-Mackey functors that do not have all transfer maps (also known as induction maps), for G a finite group. These incomplete Mackey functors have interesting and subtle properties that are more complicated than classical algebra. The levels of incompleteness that occur are indexed by simple combinatorial data known as transfer systems for G, which are refinements of the subgroup relation satisfying certain axioms. The aim of this paper is to generalise the Greenlees--May and Thevenaz--Webb splitting result of rational G-Mackey functors to the incomplete case. By calculating idempotents of the rational incomplete Burnside ring of G, we find the maximal splitting of the category of rational incomplete G-Mackey functors. These splittings are determined by maps of the form H to G in the transfer system. We give an intrinsic definition of the split pieces beyond the idempotent description in order to understand what is the minimal information needed to determine an arbitrary rational incomplete G-Mackey functor. We end the paper with a series of examples of possible splittings and illustrate how simpler transfer systems have fewer terms in the splitting but the split pieces are more complicated.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By a classical result of Gauss and Kuzmin, the frequency with which a string $\mathbf{a}=(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ of positive integers appears in the continued fraction expansion of a random real number is given by $\mu_{GK}({I(\mathbf{a})})$, where $I(\mathbf{a})$ is the set of real numbers in $[0,1)$ whose continued fraction expansion begins with the string $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mu_{GK}$ is the \emph{Gauss--Kuzmin measure}, defined by $\mu_{GK}(I)= \frac{1}{\log 2}\int_I \frac{1}{1+x} dx$, for any interval $I\subseteq[0,1]$. % It is known that the Gauss--Kuzmin measure satisfies the symmetry property $(*)$ $\mu_{GK}(I(\mathbf{a}))=\mu_{GK}(I(\overleftarrow{\mathbf{a}}))$, where $\overleftarrow{\mathbf{a}}=(a_n,\dots,a_1)$ is the reverse of the string $\mathbf{a}$. We show that this property in fact characterizes the Gauss--Kuzmin measure: If $\mu$ is any probability measure with continuous density function on $[0,1]$ satisfying $\mu(I(\mathbf{a}))=\mu(I(\overleftarrow{\mathbf{a}}))$ for all finite strings $\mathbf{a}$, then $\mu=\mu_{GK}$. % We also consider the question whether symmetries analogous to $(*)$ hold for permutations of $\mathbf{a}$ other than the reverse $\overleftarrow{\mathbf{a}}$; we call such a symmetry \emph{nontrivial}. We show that strings $\mathbf{a}$ of length $3$ have no nontrivial symmetries, while for each $n\ge 4$ there exists an infinite family of strings $\mathbf{a}$ of length $n$ that do have nontrivial symmetries. Finally we present numerical data supporting the conjecture that, in an appropriate asymptotic sense, ``almost all'' strings $\mathbf{a}$ have no nontrivial symmetries.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma = 0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta = 0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $\gamma + \delta/e = \mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $\gamma^{(n)} + \delta^{(n)}/e = \eta^{(n)}$; $n \ge 0$ for sequences of constants $\gamma^{(n)}$, $\delta^{(n)}$, and $\eta^{(n)}$ (given respectively by full, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). We first investigate the $\gamma^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations, revealing that at least one of the pair {$\gamma,\gamma^{(2)}$} and at least two of the set {$\gamma,\gamma^{(n)},\gamma^{(n+1)},\ldots,\gamma^{(2n)}$} (for all $n \ge 2$) are transcendental. This result implies $\Gamma^{(n)}(1)$ is transcendental infinitely often for $n \ge 1$. We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $\eta^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent (and therefore transcendental) for all $n \ge 0$, implying further that at least one of each pair, {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e$} and {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e,\delta^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n \ge 1$. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tilde{\delta}^{(n)}$ and $\tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $\gamma^{(n)} + \tilde{\delta}^{(n)}/e = \tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given any vertex operator algebra $ V $ with an automorphism $ g $, we derive a Jacobi identity for an intertwining operator $ \mathcal{Y} $ of type $ \left( \begin{smallmatrix} W_3\\ W_1 \, W_2 \end{smallmatrix}\right) $ when $ W_1 $ is an untwisted $ V $-module, and $ W_2 $ and $ W_3 $ are $ g $-twisted $ V $-modules. We say such an intertwining operator is of $\left(\!\begin{smallmatrix} g\\ 1 \ g \end{smallmatrix}\!\right)$-type. Using the Jacobi identity, we obtain homogeneous linear differential equations satisfied by the multi-series $ \langle w_0, \mathcal{Y}_1(w_1,z_1) \cdots \mathcal{Y}_N(w_N,z_N) w_{N+1} \rangle $ when $ \mathcal{Y}_j $ are of $\left(\!\begin{smallmatrix} g\\ 1 \ g \end{smallmatrix}\!\right)$-type and the modules are $ C_1 $-cofinite and discretely graded. In the special case that $ V $ is an affine vertex operator algebra, we derive the ``twisted KZ equations" and show that its solutions have regular singularities at certain prescribed points when $ g $ has finite order. When $ V $ is general and $ g $ has finite order, we use the theory of regular singular points to prove that the multi-series $ \langle w_0, \mathcal{Y}_1(w_1,z_1) \cdots \mathcal{Y}_N(w_N,z_N) w_{N+1} \rangle $ converges absolutely to a multivalued analytic function when $ |z_1| > \cdots > |z_N| > 0 $ and analytically extends to the region $ z_i, z_i - z_j \neq 0 $. Furthermore, when $ N = 2 $, we show that these multivalued functions have regular singularities at certain prescribed points.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Classical studies of the Fibonacci sequence focus on its periodicity modulo $m$ (the Pisano periods) with canonical initialization. We investigate instead the complete periodic structure arising from all $m^2$ possible initializations in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. We discover perfect chiral symmetry between the Fibonacci recurrence $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and its parity transform $a_n = - a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and observe fractal self-similarity in the extension from prime to prime power moduli. Additionally, we classify prime moduli based on their quadratic reciprocity and demonstrate that periodic sequences exhibit weight preservation under modular extension. Furthermore, we define a minima distribution $P(n)$ governed by Lucas ratios, which satisfies the symmetric relation $P(n)=P(1-n)$. For cyclotomic recurrences, we propose explicit counting functions for the number of distinct periods with connections to necklace enumeration. These findings imply potential connections to Viswanath's random recurrence, modular forms and L-functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define Weyl functors, global modules for equivariant map Lie superalgebras $(\g \otimes A)^{\Gamma}$, where $\g$ is basic classical $\mathbb{C}$- Lie superalgebra and $A$ is an associative commutative unital $\mathbb{C}$-algebra. Under certain condition on the triangular decomposition of $\g$ we prove that global Weyl modules are universal highest weight objects in certain category. Then with the assumption that $A$ is finitely generated, it is shown that the global Weyl modules are finitely generated.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\gamma$-$\mathsf{GapSVP}_p$ be the decision version of the shortest vector problem in the $\ell_p$-norm with approximation factor $\gamma$, let $n$ be the lattice dimension and $0<\varepsilon\leq 1$. We prove that the following statements hold for infinitely many values of $p$. $(2-\varepsilon)$-$\mathsf{GapSVP}_p$ is not in $O\left(2^{O(p)}\cdot n^{O(1)}\right)$-time, unless $\text{P}=\text{NP}$. $(2-\varepsilon)$-$\mathsf{GapSVP}_p$ is not in $O\left(2^{2^{o(p)}}\cdot 2^{o(n)}\right)$-time, unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis is false. The proofs are based on a Karp reduction from a variant of the subset-sum problem that imposes restrictions on vectors orthogonal to the vector of its weights. While more extensive hardness results for the shortest vector problem in all $\ell_p$-norms have already been established under randomized reductions, the results in this paper are fully deterministic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We survey some of the stratification theorems concerning exponential sums over finite fields, especially those due to Katz-Laumon and Fouvry-Katz, as well as some of their applications. Moreover, motivated partly by recent work of Bonolis, Pierce and Woo (arXiv:2505.11226), we prove that these stratification statements admit uniform variants in families, both algebraically and analytically. The paper includes an Appendix by Forey, Fres\'an and Kowalski (excerpted from arXiv:2109.11961), which provides an elementary intuitive introduction to trace functions in more than one variable over finite fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $R$ be a principal ideal local ring of finite length with a finite residue field of odd characteristic. Let $G(R)$ denote either the general linear group or the general unitary group of degree two over $R$. We study the decomposition of tensor products of irreducible representations of $G(R)$. It is known that the irreducible representations of $G(R)$ are built from certain distinguished regular representations, which are classified into three types: cuspidal, split semisimple, and split non-semisimple. We prove that the tensor product of any two regular irreducible representations of distinct types has irreducible constituents with multiplicity at most two. Moreover, we show that the regular part of the tensor product of a cuspidal representation with any other regular representation is multiplicity free. When both factors are of split semisimple type, we show that the multiplicity of any regular irreducible constituent is at most $\mathrm{length}(R) + 1$, and that this bound is achieved only when the constituent is also split semisimple. In contrast, we demonstrate that the multiplicity in the tensor product of two split non-semisimple representations can grow with the cardinality of the residue field when the length of the ring is at least two. In the case when $R$ is a finite field, all such tensor product multiplicities are uniformly bounded above by two. This highlights a significant difference between the behaviour of tensor products in the field case and in the more general finite local ring setting.</p></details>

For many such $G$ of rank at most $2$, in particular $G = \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb R)$, we prove effective equidistribution of large translates of tori in $G/\Gamma$. As an application, we obtain an asymptotic counting formula with a power saving error term for integral $3 \times 3$ matrices with a specified characteristic polynomial.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Plumbing spaces have drawn significant attention among symplectic topologists due to their natural occurrence as examples of Weinstein manifolds. In our paper, we provide a general formula for the wrapped Fukaya category of plumbings (with arbitrary grading structure) of cotangent bundles along any quiver. Our approach relies on "local-to-global" computations. Specifically, we compute the wrapped Fukaya category of "plumbing sectors" that serve as local models for the singularities of Lagrangian skeletons of plumbing spaces. As corollaries, we fully describe the wrapped Fukaya category of plumbing spaces in dimension $4$ and plumbings of $T^*S^n$ for $n \geq 3$. We show that any Ginzburg dg algebra/category of a graded quiver without potential is equivalent to the wrapped Fukaya category of a plumbing of $T^*S^n$ (with the corresponding grading structure).</p></details>
