### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07790v1'>2512.07790</a>\]&nbsp; **Nahm sum identities for Cartan matrices of type $D_k$**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Liuquan Wang, Shangwen Wang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Around 2007, Warnaar proved four identities related to Nahm sums associated with twice the inverse of the Cartan matrix of type $D_k$. Three of these had been conjectured by Flohr, Grabow, and Koehn, while special cases of two of the identities were first conjectured in 1993 by Kedem, Klassen, McCoy, and Melzer. Warnaar's proof relies on a multi-sum identity from Andrews' proof of the Andrews-Gordon identities. We give a new proof of all four identities using the theory of Bailey pairs. Furthermore, we establish a parametric generalization of two of the identities and provide two distinct proofs of this generalization.</p></details>

> **Comment:** The initial article has been split into two parts: this is part one, constructing geometric universal invariants for knots, and comes with a second part, providing universal link invariants. 58 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct geometrically a universal Jones invariant as a limit of invariants given by graded intersections in configuration spaces. For any fixed level $\mathscr N$, we define a new knot invariant, called ``$\mathscr N^{th}$ Unified Jones invariant'' globalising topologically all coloured Jones polynomials at levels less than $\mathscr N$. It is defined via the intersection points between {Lagrangian submanifolds} supported on arcs and ovals in the disc. The geometry of these Lagrangians is novel: previous topological models involved immersed submanifolds rather than embedded ones. We do this by defining a new local system that refines the Lawrence representation, and depends of the distribution of multiplicities of points in the configuration space on the ovals. On the algebraic side, Habiro's famous invariant for knots \cite{H3} is a universal invariant globalising the family of coloured Jones polynomials. He conjectured that this universal invariant recovers also the ADO invariant divided by the Alexander polynomials, which was proved by Willetts \cite{W} in a version of Habiro's ring (\cite{H2}). The universal Jones invariant that we construct belongs to a different ring that comes with a map to Habiro's ring \cite{H2}. We prove that our invariant recovers this version of Habiro's invariant. The difference is that our invariant is given as a limit of new knot invariants, the $\mathscr N^{th}$ unified Jones invariants. These invariants in turn provide a geometrical understanding of sets of all coloured Jones polynomials of bounded colour, collecting more information as we increase the colour.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Cristina Ana-Maria Anghel &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 54 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct geometrically two universal link invariants: universal ADO invariant and universal Jones invariant, as limits of invariants given by graded intersections in configuration spaces. More specifically, for a fixed level $\mathscr N$, we define new link invariants: ``$\mathscr N^{th}$ Unified Jones invariant'' and ``$\mathscr N^{th}$ Unified Alexander invariant''. They globalise topologically all coloured Jones polynomials for links with multi-colours bounded by $\mathscr N$ and all ADO polynomials with bounded colours. These invariants both come from the same weighted Lagrangian intersection supported on configurations on arcs and ovals in the disc. The question of providing a universal non semi-simple link invariant, recovering all the ADO polynomials was an open problem. A parallel question about semi-simple invariants for the case of knots is the subject of Habiro's famous universal knot invariant \cite{H3}. Habiro's universal construction is well defined for knots and can be extended just for certain classes of links. Our universal Jones link invariant is defined for any link and recovers all coloured Jones polynomials, providing a new semi-simple universal link invariant. The first non semi-simple universal link invariant that we construct unifies all ADO invariants for links, answering the open problem about the globalisation of these invariants.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $n \in {\mathbb N}$, let $E_n=\{1=x_k,~x_i+x_j=x_k,~x_i \cdot x_j=x_k:~i,j,k \in \{0,\ldots,n\}\}$. For $n \in {\mathbb N}$, $f(n)$ denotes the smallest $b \in {\mathbb N}$ such that if a system of equations $S \subseteq E_n$ has a solution in ${\mathbb N}^{n+1}$, then $S$ has a solution in $\{0,\ldots,b\}^{n+1}$. The author proved earlier that the function $f:{\mathbb N} \to {\mathbb N}$ is computable in the limit and eventually dominates every computable function $g:{\mathbb N} \to {\mathbb N}$. We present a short program which for $n \in {\mathbb N}$ prints the sequence $\{f_i(n)\}_{i=0}^\infty$ of non-negative integers converging to $f(n)$. We prove that no algorithm takes as input a non-negative integer $n$ and decides whether or not $\exists p,q \in {\mathbb N} ~((n=2^p \cdot 3^q) \wedge (\forall (x_0,\ldots,x_p) \in {\mathbb N}^{p+1} ~\exists (y_0,\ldots,y_p) \in \{0,\ldots,q\}^{p+1}~(\forall j,k \in \{0,\ldots,p\} ~(x_j+1=x_k \Rightarrow y_j+1=y_k)) \wedge (\forall i,j,k \in \{0,\ldots,p\} ~(x_i \cdot x_j=x_k \Rightarrow y_i \cdot y_j=y_k))))$. For $n \in {\mathbb N}$, $β(n)$ denotes the smallest $b \in {\mathbb N}$ such that if a system of equations $S\subseteq E_n$ has a unique solution in ${\mathbb N}^{n+1}$, then this solution belongs to $\{0,\ldots,b\}^{n+1}$. The author proved earlier that the function $β: {\mathbb N} \to {\mathbb N}$ is computable in the limit and eventually dominates every function $δ: {\mathbb N} \to {\mathbb N}$ with a single-fold Diophantine representation. The computability of $β$ is unknown. We present a short program which for $n \in {\mathbb N}$ prints the sequence $\{β_i(n)\}_{i=0}^\infty$ of non-negative integers converging to $β(n)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 10 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we consider the exponential Diophantine equation \( (2^k-1)(b^k-1)=y^q \) with $k\ge 2$, odd integer $b$ and an odd prime exponent $q$ and obtain effective upper bounds for $q$ in terms of $b$. In particular, we show that $q\le \log_2(b+1)$ holds apart from a finite, explicitly determined set of exceptional pairs $(b,q)$ when $3\le b<10^6$. As an application, we prove that the related equation \( (2^k-1)(b^k-1)=x^n, \) has no positive integer solution $(k,x,n)$ for several specific odd values of $b$, including $b\in\{5,7,11,13,21,23,27,29\}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a quantitative version of Zhang's fundamental inequality for heights attached to polarizable endomorphisms. As an application, we obtain a gap principle for the Néron-Tate height on abelian varieties over function fields of arbitrary transcendence degree and characteristic zero, extending the result of Gao-Ge-Kühne. We also establish instances of effective gap principles for regular polynomial endomorphisms of $\mathbb{P}^2$, in the sense that all constants can are explicit. These yield effective instances of uniformity in the dynamical Bogomolov conjecture in both the arithmetic and geometric settings, including examples in prime characteristic.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 47 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We initiate a general quantitative study of sets of $\mathcal{M}$-points, which are special subsets of rational points, generalizing Campana points, Darmon points, and squarefree solutions of Diophantine equations. We propose an asymptotic formula for the number of $\mathcal{M}$-points of bounded height on rationally connected varieties, extending Manin's conjecture as well as its generalization to Campana points by Pieropan, Smeets, Tanimoto and Várilly-Alvarado. Finally, we show that the conjecture explains several previously established results in arithmetic statistics.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish criteria for when Noether--Lefschetz divisors generate an extremal ray in the cone of pseudoeffective divisors of an orthogonal modular variety. In particular, we exhibit many extremal rays of the cone of pseudoeffective divisors on any moduli space~$\mathcal{F}_{2d}$ of quasi-polarized K3 surfaces of degree $d$, as well as on any normal projective $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial compactification $\overline{\mathcal{F}}_{2d}$ of $\mathcal{F}_{2d}$ lying over the Baily--Borel compactification.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Denote $f(n):=\sum_{1\le k\le n} τ(2^k-1)$, where $τ$ is the number of divisors function. Motivated by a question of Paul Erdős, we show that the sequence of ratios $f(2n)/f(n)$ is unbounded. We also present conditional results on the divergence of this sequence to infinity. Finally, we test numerically both the conjecture $f(2n)/f(n)\to\infty$ and our sufficient conditions for it to hold.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 60 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study a natural class of Anderson t- modules, called triangular t-modules, characterized by having Drinfeld modules as their $τ$-composition factors. They form a homologically meaningful generalization of Drinfeld modules and exhibit rich arithmetic structure.\smallskip We establish criteria for purity, strict and almost strict, and develop a reduction procedure that lowers the degrees of the defining biderivations. As a consequence, every almost strictly pure triangular t-module becomes strictly pure after a finite base extension. We then investigate morphisms and isogenies between triangular t-modules, provide a characterization of triangular isogenies, and describe the algebra of endomorphisms, including a criterion for commutativity. On the analytic side, we show that all triangular t- modules are uniformizable and establish finiteness and purity criteria with consequences for Taelman's conjecture. Finally, we develop a duality theory for triangular t- modules and their biderivations, proving compatibility with $τ$-composition series and establishing analogues of the Cartier-Nishi theorem and the Weil-Barsotti formula.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the relationship between Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) heights and weighted heights, with a focus on their interaction in weighted projective spaces and their application to binary forms. Building on the weighted height framework developed in previous papers, we relate it to Zhang's GIT height via the Veronese map. For a semistable cycle, we show that the GIT height decomposes into the logarithmic weighted height plus an Archimedean correction from the Chow metric.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let X be a smooth projective variety over a complete discretely valued field of mixed characteristic. We solve non-archimedean Monge-Ampère equations on X assuming resolution and embedded resolution of singularities. We follow the variational approach of Boucksom, Favre, and Jonsson proving the continuity of the plurisubharmonic envelope of a continuous metric on an ample line bundle on X. We replace the use of multiplier ideals in equicharacteristic zero by the use of perturbation friendly test ideals introduced by Bhatt, Ma, Patakfalvi, Schwede, Tucker, Waldron, and Witaszek building upon previous constructions by Hacon, Lamarche, and Schwede.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k\geq2$ be an integer. The aim of this paper is to investigate the distribution of $k$-full integers in consecutive intervals determined by three successive $k$th powers. More precisely, for any integers $\ell,m\ge0$, we establish the explicit asymptotic density for the set of integers $n$ such that the intervals $(n^k, (n+1)^k)$ and $((n+1)^k, (n+2)^k)$ contain exactly $\ell$ and $m$ $k$-full integers, respectively. As an application, we prove that there are infinitely many integers $n$ for which the interval $(n^k,(n+2)^k)$ contains no $k$-full integer other than the central $k$th power $(n+1)^k$, thereby providing a more general answer to Shiu's question.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce delta-forms on tropical toric varieties generalizing the construction of Mihatsch for $R^n$. These delta-forms will be used to define the star-product with Green functions of piecewise smooth type on a tropical toric variety. As an application, we show that non-archimedean local heights of projective varieties can be computed using the star-product on a suitable complete tropical toric variety. On the way, we show that open subsets of a simplicial tropical toric variety have a locally finite simplicial decomposition which is constant towards the boundary.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 16 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The aim of this study is to show that harmonic geometric polynomials can be represented in terms of geometric polynomials. This problem was first considered by Keller [14]; however, the corresponding coefficients were not fully determined. In the present work, we provide several explicit representations of harmonic geometric polynomials in terms of geometric polynomials. Moreover, several applications of one of these representations are subsequently developed. In particular, we obtain a generalization of the classical identity for the harmonic numbers, compute an integral involving harmonic geometric polynomials and an integral involving products of harmonic geometric and geometric polynomials in terms of Bernoulli numbers. These integral formulas lead to new explicit expressions for Bernoulli numbers. In addition, we give several recurrence relations for harmonic geometric polynomials and evaluate a finite sum involving harmonic numbers and positive powers of integers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that functorial equivalences can offer new insight into the blockwise Galois Alperin weight conjecture (BGAWC). Inspired by Knörr and Robinson's work, we first formulate the BGAWC in terms of alternating sums indexed by chains of $p$-subgroups, and we also give a functorial reformulation in the Grothendieck group of diagonal $p$-permutation functors. We prove that these formulations are equivalent. We further show that if a functorial equivalence between a block with abelian defect group and its Brauer correspondent descends to the minimal field of the block, then the BGAWC holds for that block. Finally, we prove that Galois conjugate blocks are functorially equivalent over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Bott vanishing is a strong vanishing result for the cohomology of exterior powers of the cotangent bundle twisted by ample line bundles.

The cominuscule case is an easy application of the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem, following results of Snow. We show that the (co)adjoint partial flag varieties of all classical and exceptional Dynkin types also do not satisfy Bott vanishing, thus confirming the conjecture for this class of varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish asymptotic formulas for sums of reciprocals of primes in arithmetic progressions, generalizing recent results on multiple Mertens evaluations by Tenenbaum, Qi, and Hu. Specifically, for any fixed constant $K>0$, we derive asymptotic expansions for the sums $ \sum_{\substack{p_1\cdots p_n\leq x \\ p_i\equiv h_i \pmod{m_i} \\ i=1,\dots, n}}\frac{1}{p_1\cdots p_n} $ and the corresponding log-weighted sums. A key feature of our results is that the error terms hold \emph{uniformly} for moduli satisfying $m_i \le (\log x)^K$, a range accessible via the Siegel-Walfisz theorem. Furthermore, we identify the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion with the Taylor series of the reciprocal Gamma function, $1/Γ(z)$, providing a structural explanation for the lower-order terms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is well known that tau functions of the KP hierarchy satisfy addition formulas. We consider the general addition formula in the determinant form and take a certain limit of it. It expresses certain shifts of a tau function in terms of the Wronskian determinants of wave functions at various values of the spectral parameter. As an application the relation between solutions created by vertex operators and those created by Darboux transformations is clarified. As another application the new addition formula for Riemann's theta functions of Riemann surfaces is obtained by considering theta function solutions of the KP hierarchy. This addition formula is different from any of formulas in Fay's book.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct an action of the braid group on the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on hypertoric varieties arising from hyperplane arrangements. Using wall-crossing equivalences associated to paths in the complexified complement of the hyperplane arrangement, we show that these equivalences under certain conditions yield a functor from the Deligne groupoid to the category of triangulated equivalences. This gives rise to a canonical representation of the fundamental group, which recovers the braid group, acting on \(D^b(\mathfrak{M}_η)\).

For $α\in \mathcal{O}_K$ with $|α| > 1$, define $$ \mathcal{D}_α= \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\mathcal{O}_K}{α^n}. $$ For $β\in \mathcal{O}_K$ with $|β|>1$ and a finite subset $A \subset \mathcal{O}_K$, define $$ S_{β,A} = \bigg\{ \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_k}{β^k}: \; a_k \in A \;\forall k \in \mathbb{N} \bigg\}. $$ Suppose that $α$ and $β$ are relatively prime. In this paper, we show that if $\dim_{\mathrm{H}} S_{β,A} < 1$, then the intersection $\mathcal{D}_α\cap S_{β,A}$ is a finite set. In general, the threshold for the Hausdorff dimension of $S_{β,A}$ is sharp. If we further assume that $\mathcal{O}_K$ is a unique factorization domain and that $\overlineα$ and $α$ are relatively prime, then we establish the finiteness of the intersection under the weaker condition $\dim_{\mathrm{H}} S_{β,A} < 2$.

> **Comment:** 53 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For two countably infinite fields whose multiplicative groups are isomorphic, we examine invariant couplings between the actions that these groups induce on the additive Pontryagin duals of the fields. We show that the actions are disjoint unless the fields themselves are isomorphic and the group isomorphism extends (possibly after a finite twist) to a field isomorphism. As an application, we establish equidistribution of Følner-Kloosterman sums - an extension of classical Kloosterman sums to infinite fields. Unlike the classical case over algebraic closures of finite fields, these averages exhibit an inherent multiplicative asymmetry, revealing new and fundamentally different behavior. Finally, we derive several combinatorial consequences, including results on sum-product phenomena and a Furstenberg--Sárközy-type theorem for Laurent polynomials over general fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we prove for a broad class of pseudo convex formal-analytic arithmetic surfaces, those which admit a nonconstant monic such regular function, a conjecture of Bost-Charles that the ring of regular functions has continuum cardinality. A key feature of the proof is a new formula for the pushforward of the equilibrium Green's functions for our bordered Riemann surface with boundary by a holomorphic function, a formula which has constant term related to Arakelov degree. A Fekete-Szëgo-type approximation argument then produces a polynomial "large" relative to the regular function, which in turn yields continuum many distinct regular functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The representation theory of left regular band semigroup algebras is well-studied and known to have close connections with combinatorial topology, as established in the work of Margolis--Saliola--Steinberg ('15, '21). In this paper, we investigate the representation theory of the invariant subalgebras of left regular band semigroup algebras carrying the action of a finite group through the lens of group-equivariant combinatorial topology. We characterize when the invariant subalgebra is semisimple or commutative and examine the equivariant structure of the Peirce components of the semigroup algebra. For CW left regular bands, we interpret these Peirce components in terms of the equivariant topology of intervals in the support semilattice, yielding the Cartan invariants of the invariant subalgebras of left regular bands associated to CAT(0)-cube complexes. We also give a topological formula for the Peirce components for left regular bands with hereditary algebras. Finally, in specializing to left regular bands associated to geometric lattices, we explore generalizations of the Desarménién--Wachs derangement representation and their connections to Markov chains.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 19 pages, 3 figures. Material on sets with squarefree sums shortened due to overlap with existing literature

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We answer several questions of Erdős regarding sequences of natural numbers $A$ whose translates $n+A$ intersect with the squarefree numbers in various specified ways. For instance, we show that if every translate only contains finitely many squarefree numbers, then $A$ has zero density, although the decay rate of this density can be arbitrarily slow. On the other hand, there exist sequences $A$ with optimal density $6/π^2$ for which infinitely many $n$ exist such that $n+a$ is squarefree for all $a \in A$ with $a < n$. In fact, infinitely many such $n$ exist for every exponentially increasing sequence, as long as the sequence avoids at least one residue class modulo $p^2$ for all primes $p$, a property we call admissible. If one instead requires infinitely many $n$ to exist such that $n+a$ is squarefree for all $a \in A$, then $A$ can have density arbitrarily close to, but not equal to, $6/π^2$. Finally, we prove bounds on the growth rate of sequences $A$ for which $a+a'$ is squarefree for all $a,a' \in A$, as well as bounds on the largest admissible subset of $\{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper concerns extension of the classical Lagrange theorem, on the eventual periodicity of continued fraction expansions of quadratic surds, and the versions of it found in the literature in the case of complex numbers. In this respect, firstly, we adopt a more general notion of continued fraction expansions, in place of those arising from the nearest integer algorithms. Secondly, the issue is formulated in terms of zeros of quadratic and Hermitian forms, and a result is proved in terms of certain sequences of matrices associated with them, via continued fraction expansions. The result may be considered as a matrix analogue of Lagrange's theorem in the general framework. The unified approach leads to generalizations of the Lagrange theorem on one hand, and an extended version of a result of Hines (2019) on badly approximable complex numbers, on the other hand.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A filtration of the morphisms of the $k$-linearization $k \mathbf{FS}$ of the category $\mathbf{FS}$ of finite sets and surjections is constructed using a natural $k \mathbf{FI}^{op}$-module structure induced by restriction, where $\mathbf{FI}$ is the category of finite sets and injections. In particular, this yields the `primitive' subcategory $ k \mathbf{FS}^0 \subset k \mathbf{FS}$ that is of independent interest; for example, the category of $k \mathbf{FS}^0$-modules is closely related to the category of $k \mathbf{FA}$-modules, where $\mathbf{FA}$ is the category of finite sets and all maps. Working over a field of characteristic zero, the subquotients of this filtration are identified as bimodules over $k \mathbf{FB}$, where $\mathbf{FB}$ is the category of finite sets and bijections, also exhibiting and exploiting additional structure. In particular, this describes the underlying $k \mathbf{FB}$-bimodule of $k \mathbf{FS}^0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\lfloor x\rfloor$ denote the integer part of $x$. For every sequence $(C_k)_{k\ge 1}$ of positive integers, we define $ξ(C_k)$ as the smallest real number $ξ>1$ such that $\lfloor ξ^{C_k} \rfloor$ is a prime number for every positive integer $k$. The number $ξ(3^k)$ is called Mills' constant. Recently, the author showed that $ξ(3^k)$ is irrational; however, the transcendency remains open. In this paper, we show that Mills' constant is transcendental under the Density Hypothesis of the Riemann zeta function. Furthermore, we obtain four classes of sequences $(C_k)_{k\ge 1}$ for which we can verify the arithmetic properties of $ξ(C_k)$. For simplicity, we give four representative examples belonging to each class: (A) $ξ(\lfloor b^k\rfloor)$ is irrational for every real number $b\ge 1+\sqrt{2}$; (B) $ξ((1+\sqrt{2})^k+(1-\sqrt{2})^k)$ is transcendental; (C) $ξ(r3^k-1)$ is transcendental for every integer $r\ge 4.003\times 10^{14}$; (D) $ξ(3^{k-\lfloor (\log k)^{1/2} \rfloor}2^{\lfloor (\log k)^{1/2}\rfloor})$ is transcendental.</p></details>

We also introduce Lie-Rinehart superalgebras in characteristic $2$ and clarify their connections with Poisson superalgebras. In particular, we show that the universal enveloping algebra of a Poisson superalgebra coincides with the universal enveloping algebra of an associated Lie-Rinehart superalgebra. We also compute examples and initiate the study of pre-Poisson superalgebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a finite-dimensional algebra over a field $k$. We define $A$ to be $\mathbf{C}$-dichotomic if it has the dichotomy property of the representation type on complexes of projective $A$-modules. $\mathbf{C}$-dichotomy implies the dichotomy properties of representation type on the levels of homotopy category and derived category. If $k$ admits a finite separable field extension $K/k$ such that $K$ is algebraically closed, the real number field for example, we prove that $A$ is $\mathbf{C}$-dichotomic. As a consequence, the second derived Brauer-Thrall type theorem holds for $A$, i.e., $A$ is either derived discrete or strongly derived unbounded.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 44 pages. Comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define the notion of a non-abelian Jacobi sum $\mathcal{J}^{\mathrm{dbl}}\left(π, χ\right)$ attached to an irreducible representation $π$ of a general linear group or a classical group over a finite field and a character $χ$ of the multiplicative group of the finite field or its quadratic extension. These sums emerge in the study of the doubling method of Piatetski-Shapiro--Rallis and Lapid--Rallis. For general linear groups, we express these non-abelian Jacobi sums in terms of Kondo's non-abelian Gauss sums. For classical groups and for characters that are not conjugate-dual, we give an explicit formula for these non-abelian Jacobi sums in terms of Gauss sums attached to the Deligne--Lusztig data of the representation, and we prove that these Jacobi sums are constant on geometric Lusztig series. Our results rely on a multiplicativity result of non-abelian Jacobi sums obtained by Girsch--Zelingher.</p></details>

> **Comment:** We do not address the global open problem of non-trivial solutions to a^k+b^k=c^k+d^k for k>4 without linear constraints

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Diophantine equation $a^k + b^k = c^k + d^k$ with integer variables and exponent $k>1$, under the linear constraint $(c+d) - (a+b) = h$. We analyze the geometry and arithmetic of these linear slices. On the central slice $h=0$, we prove strictly convex uniqueness: distinct unordered pairs with the same sum yield distinct power sums. For shifted slices $h\neq 0$, we establish a Modular Divisibility Obstruction (MDO): any solution requires $h$ to be divisible by a specific squarefree modulus $M_k = \prod_{p-1 \mid k-1} p$. This condition creates a strong divisibility filter; for example, if $k=13$, the obstruction eliminates $99.96\%$ of all possible shifts. We combine this arithmetic constraint with a geometric exclusion zone principle and a global overlap bound, showing that the slice size must satisfy $\min\{S, S+h\} \gg |h|$. Finally, we prove an asymptotic dominance bound $k \le \max\{S, S+h\} \log 2$, implying that for any fixed slice, solutions cannot exist for sufficiently large $k$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper introduces and systematically studies Weyl-type, Witt-type, and non-associative algebras defined over expolynomial rings -- commutative rings generated by exponential functions $e^{αx}$, exponentials of exponentials $e^{\pm x^p e^{t}}$, and power functions $x^α$ for $α$ in an additive subgroup $\cA$ of a characteristic zero field $\FF$. We establish several fundamental structural results: scalar extensions preserve both the algebraic structure and simplicity; intermediate subalgebras associated with subgroups $\ZZ \subseteq \cB \subseteq \cA$ remain simple; the algebra of graded derivations is isomorphic to a semidirect product $\Weyl{e^{\pm x^p e^{t}},\; e^{\cA x},\; x^{\cA}} \rtimes \FF^n$; tensor products over disjoint variable sets decompose naturally into larger algebras; and a complete isomorphism criterion is given, showing that isomorphism depends precisely on the orbit of the parameter $p$ under the automorphism group of $\cA$ and the equality of the deformation parameter $t$. These theorems generalize classical results on Weyl and Witt algebras, provide new families of simple algebras, and offer a foundation for further research in deformation theory, representation theory, and cohomology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper introduces and systematically studies a class of Weyl-type algebras enriched with exponential and power generators over a field of characteristic zero, defined as $A_{p,t,\cA} = \Weyl{e^{\pm x^{p} e^{t}},\; e^{\cA x},\; x^{\cA}}$ in the associative setting and $\Nass{e^{\pm x^{p} e^{t}},\; e^{\cA x},\; x^{\cA}}$ in a non-associative framework. We establish fundamental structural properties, including the triviality of the center for the non-associative version and the explicit description $Z(A_{p,t,\cA}) = \FF[e^{\pm x^{p} e^{t}}]$ for the associative one, proving that $A_{p,t,\cA}$ is an Azumaya algebra over its center and represents a nontrivial class in the Brauer group $\Br(\FF(y))$. Furthermore, we compute the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension for relevant examples and demonstrate its key properties, such as additivity under tensor products and the growth dichotomy. We completely characterize the automorphism group of $A_{p,t,\cA}$ as a semidirect product of a torus with a discrete group, and provide a sharp isomorphism criterion showing that the parameter $t$ is a complete invariant in the family. The paper concludes with two open problems concerning the GK dimension of non-associative exponential algebras and the classification of their deformations, pointing toward future research directions in non-associative growth theory and deformation rigidity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We derive Rogers--Ramanujan type partition identities at the fundamental weight $Λ_0$ for the exceptional affine types $G_2^{(1)}$, $D_4^{(3)}$, $F_4^{(1)}$, $E_6^{(2)}$, $E_6^{(1)}$, $E_7^{(1)}$ and $E_8^{(1)}$. Our starting point is the Dousse--Konan reformulation of the $(\mathrm{KMN})^2$ crystal character formula, applied to the level-one perfect crystal $B=B(θ)\sqcup B(0)$ of Benkart--Frenkel--Kang--Lee with ground element $φ\in B(0)$. This realizes the normalized character $e^{-Λ_0}\mathrm{ch} L(Λ_0)$ as generating functions of grounded $B$-colored partitions governed locally by the crystal energy. After principal specialization, we obtain a colored partition model subject to explicit difference, congruence, and initial conditions. On the product side, under the same specialization, the Weyl--Kac character formula yields an explicit Euler-type product, equivalently the generating function for partitions with parts in a concrete allowed set. Comparing the two specializations gives coefficientwise equalities of generating functions. A key computational feature is that the difference matrix can be produced from the crystal data without explicitly computing the energy function. For each type we tabulate the congruence data, forbidden initial parts, and the full difference matrix, and we provide reproducible coefficient checks.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 11 pages. v2: corrected Lemma 6.1 (energy-to-doubling inequality), added discussion of concurrent work on bounded torsion groups, and polished exposition throughout

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study small-doubling subsets of finite-dimensional vector spaces over finite fields of odd characteristic. Let $A \subset \mathbb{F}_p^n$ be non-empty with $|A+A| \le K|A|$. We prove that $A$ can be covered by at most $K^{O(1)}$ cosets of a subspace $H \le \mathbb{F}_p^n$ with $|H| \le K^{O(1)}|A|$, giving a polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa (PFR/Marton) theorem in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ for odd primes $p$. The key input is a polynomial stability lemma which yields a dichotomy: either the $L^4$ Fourier mass of $1_A$ concentrates on a span of dimension $\mathrm{poly}(K)$, or in a quotient of codimension $\mathrm{poly}(K)$ the doubling constant decreases by at least $K^{-C}$. Iterating the latter alternative and combining it with standard covering arguments gives the polynomial-structured conclusion. Together with the characteristic-$2$ result of Green, Gowers, Manners, and Tao (2023), this completes the resolution of Marton's conjecture for all finite fields. Our proof provides an independent, direct Fourier-analytic approach with explicit spectral stability dichotomies.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We complete the proof of the Nisnevich conjecture in equal characteristic: for a smooth algebraic variety $X$ over a field $k$, a $k$-smooth divisor $D \subset X$, and a reductive $X$-group $G$ whose base change $G_D$ is totally isotropic, we show that each generically trivial $G$-torsor on $X\setminus D$ trivializes Zariski semilocally on $X$. In mixed characteristic, we show the same when $k$ is a replaced by a discrete valuation ring $O$, the divisor $D$ is the closed $O$-fiber of $X$, and either $G$ is quasi-split or $G$ is only defined over $X \setminus D$ but descends to a quasi-split group over $\mathrm{Frac}(O)$ (a Kisin-Pappas type variant). Our arguments combine Gabber-Quillen style presentation lemmas with excision and reembedding dévissages to reduce to analyzing generically trivial torsors over a relative affine line. As a byproduct of this analysis, we give a new proof for the Bass-Quillen conjecture for reductive group torsors over $\mathbb{A}^d_R$ in equal characteristic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Moore-Tachikawa conjecture is that each connected complex semisimple group $G$ determines a two-dimensional TQFT in a category of Hamiltonian symplectic varieties. While it would be worthwhile to prove this conjecture outright, our objectives are drastically different. We instead view the Moore--Tachikawa conjecture as a first step in systematically assigning new TQFTs to purely Lie-theoretic data. At the same time, one should expect these new TQFTs to bear a close relation to those conjectured by Moore and Tachikawa. Our manuscript aims to integrate these two points of view. Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be the Lie algebra of $G$. Consider a conjugacy class $\mathcal{C}$ of parabolic subalgebras of $\mathfrak{g}$. This class determines partial Grothendieck--Springer resolutions $μ_{\mathcal{C}}:\mathfrak{g}_{\mathcal{C}}\longrightarrow\mathfrak{g}^*=\mathfrak{g}$ and $ν_{\mathcal{C}}:G_{\mathcal{C}}\longrightarrow G$. We construct a canonical symplectic groupoid $(T^*G)_{\mathcal{C}}\substack{\longrightarrow\\[-9pt] \longrightarrow}\mathfrak{g}_{\mathcal{C}}$ and quasi-symplectic groupoid $\mathrm{D}(G)_{\mathcal{C}}\substack{\longrightarrow\\[-9pt] \longrightarrow} G_{\mathcal{C}}$. By considering a Kostant slice $\mathrm{Kos}\subseteq\mathfrak{g}$ and Steinberg slice $\mathrm{Ste}\subseteq G$, we prove that the pairs $(((T^*G)_{\mathcal{C}})_{\text{reg}}\substack{\longrightarrow\\[-9pt] \longrightarrow}(\mathfrak{g}_{\mathcal{C}})_{\text{reg}},μ_{\mathcal{C}}^{-1}(\mathrm{Kos}))$ and $((\mathrm{D}(G)_{\mathcal{C}})_{\text{reg}}\substack{\longrightarrow\\[-9pt] \longrightarrow}(G_{\mathcal{C}})_{\text{reg}},ν_{\mathcal{C}}^{-1}(\mathrm{Ste}))$ determine new and explicit TQFTs in a $1$-shifted Weinstein symplectic category. We then show that certain symplectic varieties arising from our new TQFTs have canonical Lagrangian relations to the open Moore-Tachikawa varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the prefundamental modules $L_{s,a}^{\pm}$ over the Borel subalgebras of the twisted quantum loop algebras, which are introduced by Wang. A character formula for $L_{s,a}^{\pm}$ is obtained from that for the prefundamental modules over the untwisted quantum loop algebras by applying a character folding map. This allows us to realize minuscule prefundamental modules $L_{s,a}^{\pm}$ for types $A_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ and $D_{n+1}^{(2)}$ in terms of the unipotent quantum coordinate ring associated with the $s$-th level $0$ fundamental weight, where $s = 1$ for type $A_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ and $s = n$ for type $D_{n+1}^{(2)}$. This result is a continuation of the realization of (co)minuscule prefundamental modules established by earlier works [J-Kwon-Park, Int. Math. Res. Not., 2023] and [J-Kwon-Park, J.

For a local field F of characteristic zero, we prove that the sequence ([αx^n]) is uniformly distributed in the valuation ring O for almost every x with |x|_p>1. In the case of positive characteristic, ([x^n]) fails to be uniformly distributed, but it becomes μ*-uniformly distributed for some weighted measure μ*. These results are derived from a general metric theorem for sequences generated by expanding scaling maps. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the exceptional set of parameters x for which these sequences are not uniformly distributed is large (i.e. having full Hausdorff dimension) and share a rich q-homogeneous fractal structure.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This series of papers is a contribution to the program of classifying $p$-blocks of finite groups up to source algebra equivalence, starting with the case of cyclic blocks. To any $p$-block $\mathbf{B}$ of a finite group with cyclic defect group $D$, Linckelmann associated an invariant $W( \mathbf{B} )$, which is an indecomposable endo-permutation module over $D$, and which, together with the Brauer tree of $\mathbf{B}$, essentially determines its source algebra equivalence class. In Parts II-IV of our series of papers, we classify, for odd $p$, those endo-permutation modules of cyclic $p$-groups arising from $p$-blocks of quasisimple groups. In the present Part II, we reduce the desired classification for the quasisimple classical groups of Lie type $B$, $C$, and $D$ to the corresponding objective for the general linear and unitary groups; the classification is completed for the latter groups.</p></details>

We determine what representations appear for certain examples of tensor categories, develop general principles and demonstrate how this question connects with the ongoing study of the structure theory of tensor categories. We also formalise a theory of polynomial functors as functors which act coherently on all tensor categories. We conclude that the classification of such functors is a different way of posing the above question of which representation of symmetric groups appear. Finally, we extend the classical notion of strict polynomial functors from the category of (super) vector spaces to arbitrary tensor categories, and show that this idea is also a different packaging of the same information.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Closed geodesics associated with indefinite binary quadratic forms, or equivalently with real quadratic irrationals, have long been studied as geometric $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$-invariants. Building on the Birman-Williams approach to Lorenz knots and following the notion of modular knots introduced by Ghys, this article investigates the topological $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$-invariants arising from modular knots. Our main focus is the Alexander polynomial of modular knots. Using the Burau representation, we highlight two contrasting features of this family. On the one hand, for each fixed degree, only finitely many Alexander polynomials of modular knots occur. On the other hand, any integer appears as a coefficient of the Alexander polynomial of some modular knot, and coefficients of the same sign can occur in runs of arbitrarily long length.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A function from $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ to $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ is $k$th order sum-free if the sum of its values over each $k$-dimensional $\mathbb{F}_2$-affine subspace is nonzero. It is conjectured that for $n$ odd and prime, $f_\textrm{inv}=x^{-1}$ is not $k$th order sum-free for $3 \leq k \leq n-3$. This is the unresolved part of Carlet's conjecture, which gives exact values for which $f_\textrm{inv}$ is $k$th order sum-free. We give two results as improvements on an explicit estimate on the number of $q$-rational points of an $\mathbb{F}_q$-definable hypersurface previously proved by Cafure and Matera. We use these results to prove that $f_\textrm{inv}$ is not $k$th order sum-free for $3\leq k \leq \frac{3}{13}n+0.461$, improving on work previously done by Hou and Zhao.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we examine the restriction of the metaplectic representation $π$ over a $p$-adic field $k$, $p\neq2$, of zero characteristic to an isotropic torus $S$ contained in the symplectic group. First we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the momentum map in order that $S$ be admissible, that is $π_{\vert S}$ decomposes with finite multiplicities. Let us say that a torus contained in the symplectic group is irreducible if its action on the symplectic space is irreducible over $k$. Then we examine the case when $S$ is a proper subtorus of a maximal irreducible torus $T$ in the symplectic group and give sufficient conditions on $T$ in order that $S$ never be admissible. When these conditions are not satisfied, we give examples of admissible proper tori of a maximal irreducible torus. Finally, for any admissible subtorus $S$ of a certain type of maximal irreducible torus, we compute the multiplicity of the unitary characters of $S$ appearing into $π_{\vert S}$. We also show that the multiplicity of such a character is equal to the volume of the symplectic reduction of the inverse image under the momentum map of a linear form associated to it.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The rational points of a smooth curve $X$ over a number field $k$ map to the set of augmentations of the associated motivic algebra. An expectation, related to Kim's conjecture, is that for $X$ hyperbolic, the set of augmentations which come locally at each place of $k$ from a point is equal to the set of rational points. Our view is that this should provide a relative of the Grothendieck section conjecture which may be both more accessible, and more directly applicable, than the latter. As a first step in this direction, we extend aspects of the ``Weil height machine'' to the set of such augmentations, and use this to prove a Manin--Dem'janenko-style finiteness result for motivic augmentations for particular curves. Along the way, we determine the structure of the cohomological motive of a $\mathbb{G}_m$-bundle over an algebraic variety as a highly structured algebra in the derived $\infty$-category of mixed motives with rational coefficients.</p></details>

In this paper, for any prism $S/A$ with a surjection $S\to R$ such that $\widehat{\mathbb L}_{\overline{S}/\overline{A}}$ is a $p$-completely flat module over $\overline{S}$, we establish an equivalence of categories between rational Hodge-Tate crystals on $(R/A)_Δ$ and topologically nilpotent integrable connections on the Hodge--Tate cohomology ring $\overlineΔ_{R/S}$. As an application, for a non-zero divisor $a\in \overline{A}$, we introduce the concept of $a$-smallness for a rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystal on $(R/A)_Δ$. Finally, we focus on some special algebras $R$ over $\mathcal O_{\mathbb C_p}$ (or generally, the ring of integers of an algebraic closed and complete non-archimedean field) including all $p$-completely smooth algebras, $p$-complete algebras with semi-stable reductions and geometric valuation rings. By using our equivalence, we analyze the restriction functor from the category of $a$-small rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystals to the category of $v$-vector bundles. This yields some new results in $p$-adic non-abelian Hodge Theory.</p></details>

As a result, we derive structural results for splendid Rickard equivalences that correspond to known structural properties for $p$-permutation equivalences. In particular, we show splendid Rickard equivalences induce local splendid Rickard equivalences between normalizer block algebras as well as centralizer block algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that, given the Balmer spectrum of any essentially small monoidal-triangulated category, one has a classification of semiprime thick tensor-ideals arising in terms of a "pseudo-Hochster-dual" of the noncommutative Balmer spectrum. This extends Balmer's classification of radical thick tensor-ideals to noncommutative tensor-triangular geometry. To achieve this, we utilize the notion of support data for lattices and frames, under which the classification follows via Stone duality. We also give a characterization for when the noncommutative Balmer spectrum behaves as it does in tensor-triangular geometry, that is, when it is a spectral space with quasi-compact opens given by complements of supports. Finally, we show that rigid centrally generated monoidal-triangulated categories satisfy this property, and we answer a question posed by Negron--Pevtsova regarding classification of one-sided tensor-ideals via cohomological support.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop (quantum) cluster algebra structures over arbitrary commutative unital rings $\Bbbk$ and prove that the (quantized) coordinate rings of connected simply-connected complex simple algebraic groups $G$ over $\Bbbk$ admit such structures. We first show that the integral form of the quantized coordinate ring of $G$ admits an upper quantum cluster algebra structure over $\mathbb{A}=\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm\frac{1}{2}}]$ by using a combination of tools from quantum groups, canonical bases and cluster algebras and a previous result of the second and third authors over $\mathbb{Q}(q^{\frac{1}{2}})$. We then obtain (integral) quantum versions of recent results of the first author: when $G$ is not of type $F_4$, the quantized coordinate ring of $G$ admits a quantum cluster algebra structure over $\mathbb{A}'$, where $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{A}$ when $G$ is not of types $G_2$, $E_8$, and $F_4$; $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{A}[(q^2+1)^{-1}]$ when $G$ is of type $G_2$, and $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{Q}(q^{\frac{1}{2}})$ when $G$ is of type $E_8$. We furthermore prove that the classical versions of these results hold over $\mathbb{A}'$ (where $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{Z}$ if $G$ is not of type $F_4$ or $G_2$ and $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{2}]$ if $G$ is of type $G_2$) and that the integral form of the coordinate ring of $G$ of type $F_4$ is an upper cluster algebra. Finally, by using common triangular bases of (quantum) cluster algebras, we prove that the above results also hold under specializations of $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{A}'$ to commutative unital rings $\Bbbk$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a perverse sheaf on the moduli stack of principally polarized abelian varieties or the moduli stack of smooth curves with n marked points over a field of characteristic zero, we prove that the (orbifold) Euler characteristic is nonnegative. For constant coefficients, this follows immediately from formulas of Harer-Zagier and Harder. Our proof is different and in the case of abelian varieties uses log Dubson-Kashiwara plus the fact that Hodge bundles are nef. For curves, we require an additional inequality established using Beilinson's gluing construction. The first main result is shown to be false in positive characteristic.</p></details>
