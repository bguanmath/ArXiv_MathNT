### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15841v1'>2507.15841</a>\]&nbsp; **Some Lagrangian quiver Grassmannians for the equioriented cycle**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Matteo Micheli &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to better understand a family of linear degenerations of the classical Lagrangian Grassmannians $\Lambda(2n)$. It is the special case for $k=n$ of the varieties $X(k,2n)^{sp}$, introduced in previous joint work with Evgeny Feigin, Martina Lanini and Alexander P\"utz. These varieties are obtained as isotropic subvarieties of a family of quiver Grassmannians $X(n,2n)$, and are acted on by a linear degeneration of the algebraic group $Sp_{2n}$. We prove a conjecture proposed in the paper above for this particular case, which states that the ordering on the set of orbits in $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ given by closure-inclusion coincides with a combinatorially defined order on what are called symplectic $(n,2n)$-juggling patterns, much in the same way that the $Sp_{2n}$ orbits in $\Lambda(2n)$ are parametrized by a type C Weyl group with the Bruhat order. The dimension of such orbits is computed via the combinatorics of bounded affine permutations, and it coincides with the length of some permutation in a Coxeter group of affine type C. Furthermore, the varieties $X(n,2n)$ are GKM, that is, they have trivial cohomology in odd degree and are equipped with the action of an algebraic torus with finitely many fixed points and 1-dimensional orbits. In this paper it is proven that $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ is also GKM.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In previous work we computed the number $C_n(q)$ of ideals of codimension $n$ of the algebra ${\mathbb{F}}_q[x,y,x^{-1}, y^{-1}]$ of two-variable Laurent polynomials over a finite field: it turned out that $C_n(q)$ is a palindromic polynomial of degree $2n$ in $q$, divisible by $(q-1)^2$. The quotient $P_n(q) = C_n(q)/(q-1)^2$ is a palindromic polynomial of degree $2n-2$. For each $n\geq 1$ there is a unique degree $n-1$ polynomial ${\overline{P}}_n(X) \in {\mathbb{Z}}[X]$ such that ${\overline{P}}_n(q+q^{-1}) = P_n(q)/q^{n-1}$. In this note we show that for any integer $N$ the integer value ${\overline{P}}_n(N)$ is close to the value at $N$ of the degree $n-1$ polynomial $F_{n-1}(X) = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \, {\overline{T}}_k(X)$, which is a sum of monic versions ${\overline{T}}_k(X)$ of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. We give a precise formula for ${\overline{P}}_n(X)$ as a linear combination of $F_k(X)$'s, each appearance of the latter being parametrized by an odd divisor of $n$. As a consequence, ${\overline{P}}_n(X) = F_{n-1}(X)$ if and only if $n$ is a power of $2$. We exhibit similar formulas for $C_n(q)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This is a substantial replacement of the earlier version, whose contents have been divided into two disjoint papers: the current paper and the paper entitled "Weibel vanishing and the projective bundle formula for mixed characteristic motivic cohomology"

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a theory of motivic cohomology for quasi-compact quasi-separated schemes, which generalises the construction of Elmanto--Morrow in the case of schemes over a field. Our construction is non-$\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant in general, but it uses the classical $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant motivic cohomology of smooth $\mathbb{Z}$-schemes as an input. The main new input of our construction is a global filtration on topological cyclic homology, whose graded pieces provide an integral refinement of derived de Rham cohomology and Bhatt--Morrow--Scholze's syntomic cohomology. Our theory satisfies various expected properties of motivic cohomology, including relations to \'etale cohomology and to non-connective algebraic $K$-theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a finite 2-group. We show that the 2-category $2\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{G})$ of finite semisimple 2-representations is a symmetric fusion 2-category. We also relate the auto-equivalence 2-group of the symmetric monoidal forgetful 2-functor $\omega : 2\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{G}) \to 2\mathrm{Vec}$ to the auto-equivalence 2-group of the regular algebra and show that they are equivalent to $\mathcal{G}$. This result categorifies the usual Tannaka-Krein duality for finite groups.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Qipin Chen, Shane Chern, Atsuro Yoshida &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser recently considered a family of binomial determinants. In this work, we give combinatorial interpretations of two subclasses of these determinants in terms of domino tilings and nonintersecting lattice paths, thereby partially answering a question of theirs. Furthermore, the determinant evaluations established by Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser produce many product formulas for our weighted enumerations of domino tilings and nonintersecting lattice paths. However, there are still two enumerations left corresponding to conjectural formulas made by the three. We hereby prove the two conjectures using the principle of holonomic Ansatz plus the approach of modular reduction for creative telescoping, and hence fill the gap.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages. Add examples in section 4.4. Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we generalize the notion of character for 2-representations of finite 2-groups. The properties of 2-characters bear strong similarities to those classical characters of finite groups, including conjugation invariance, additivity, multiplicativity and orthogonality. With a careful analysis using homotopy fixed points and quotients for categories with 2-group actions, we prove that the category of class functors on a 2-group $\mathcal G$ is equivalent to the Drinfeld center of the 2-group algebra $\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathcal G}$, which categorifies the Fourier transform on finite abelian groups. After transferring the canonical nondegenerate braided monoidal structure from $\mathfrak Z_1(\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathcal G})$, we discover that irreducible 2-characters of $\mathcal G$ coincide with full centers of the corresponding 2-representations, which are in a one-to-one correspondence with Lagrangian algebras in the category of class functors on $\mathcal G$. In particular, the fusion rule of $2\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal G)$ can be calculated from the pointwise product of Lagrangian algebras as class functors. From a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) point of view, the commutative Frobenius algebra structure on a 2-character is induced from a 2D topological sigma-model with target space $\lvert \mathrm{B} \mathcal G \rvert$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let A^d denote the coefficient space of all degree-d polynomials f in one variable for some d\ge 3. For any \bar{f} in A^d(\bar\F_p), a rank-\ell Artin-Schreier curve X_{\bar{f},\ell}: y^{p^\ell}-y= \bar{f} is called ordinary if its normalized Newton polygon achieves the infimum in A^d(\bar\F_p). Given \ell and a number field K, we show that there exists a Zariski dense open subset U in A^d, defined over Q, such that if f in U(K) then X_{(f\bmod \wp),\ell} is ordinary for all primes $\wp|p$ with deg(\wp) in \ell\Z and p large enough.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Eitan Levin, Venkat Chandrasekaran &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.OC &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Polynomial optimization problems often arise in sequences indexed by dimension, and it is of interest to produce bounds on the optimal values of all problems in the sequence. Examples include certifying inequalities between symmetric functions or graph homomorphism densities that hold over vectors and graphs of all sizes, and computing the value of mean-field games viewed as limits of games with a growing number of players. In this paper, we study such any-dimensional polynomial problems using the theory of representation stability, and we develop a systematic framework to produce hierarchies of bounds for their limiting optimal values in terms of finite-dimensional polynomial optimization problems. Our bounds converge at explicit rates, and they follow as a consequence of new de Finetti-type theorems pertaining to sequences of random arrays projecting onto each other in different ways. The proofs of these theorems are based on applying results from probability to representations of certain categories. We apply our framework to produce new bounds on problems arising in a number of application domains such as mean-field games, extremal graph theory, and symmetric function theory, and we illustrate our methods via numerical experiments.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the derived category of permutation modules for a finite group, in positive characteristic. We stratify this tensor triangulated category using Brauer quotients. We describe the spectrum of its compact objects, by reducing the problem to elementary abelian groups and then by using a twisted form of cohomology to express the spectrum locally in terms of the graded endomorphism ring of the unit. Together, these results yield a classification of thick and of localizing ideals.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 57 pages; a few minor changes based on a referee report; final version; to appear in Mathematische Zeitschrift

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be the group of rational points of a split connected reductive group over a non-archimedean local field of residue characteristic $p$, and let $\mathcal{H}$ denote the pro-$p$ Iwahori-Hecke algebra of $G$ over a field of characteristic $p$. We study the parabolic induction functor for $\mathcal{H}$-modules in terms of the Gorenstein projective model structures introduced by Hovey. Let $\text{Ho}(\mathcal{H})$ denote the associated homotopy category of this model structure. We show that $\text{Ho}(\mathcal{H})$ and its thick subcategory generated by the essential images of finitely many parabolic induction functors are related via a recollement of triangulated categories. We then investigate the isomorphism classes of simple $\mathcal{H}$-modules in $\text{Ho}(\mathcal{H})$ and give a complete classification for simple supersingulars when $G=\mathrm{GL}_n$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This is the English version of the author's undergraduate thesis. Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the continued fractions with bounded odd/even-order partial quotients. In particular, we investigate the sizes of the sets of continued fractions whose odd-order partial quotients are equal to 1. We demonstrate that the sum and the product of two sets of continued fractions whose odd-order partial quotients are equal to 1 both contain non-empty intervals. Our work compliments the results of Han\v{c}l and Turek on the set of continued fractions whose even-order partial quotients are equal to 1. Furthermore, we determine the Hausdorff dimensions of the sets of continued fractions whose odd-order partial quotients are equal to 1 and even-order partial quotients are growing at an exponential rate, a super-exponential rate, and in general a positive function rate.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime and $n\geq 2$ be a positive integer. We establish new formulae for the decompositions of the first $p-1$ symmetric powers of the Specht module $S^{(n-1,1)}$ and the irreducible module $D^{(n-1,1)}$ in characteristic $p$ as direct sums of Young permutation modules. As an application of the formulae, we show that these symmetric powers have Specht filtration and find the vertices of their indecomposable summands. Our main tool, constructed in this paper, is a lift of a splitting map of a short exact sequence of certain symmetric powers to a splitting map of a short exact sequence of higher symmetric powers. This is a general construction, which can be applied to a broader family of modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a zero-free region and an averaged zero-density estimate for all Dirichlet $L$-functions modulo $q$, we refine the error terms of the prime number theorem in all and almost all short arithmetic progressions. For example, if we assume the Generalized Density Hypothesis, then for any arithmetic progression modulo $q\leq \log^{\ell} x$ with $\ell>0$ and any $\alpha>\frac{2}{3}$, the prime number theorem holds in all intervals $(x,x+\sqrt{x}\exp(\log^\alpha x)]$ and almost all intervals $(x,x+\exp(\log^\alpha x)]$ as $x\rightarrow\infty$. This refines the classic intervals $(x,x+x^{1/2+\varepsilon}]$ and $(x,x+x^\varepsilon]$ for any $\varepsilon>0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A closed subgroup $G\subset_uU_N^+$ is called easy when its associated Tannakian category $C_{kl}=Hom(u^{\otimes k},u^{\otimes l})$ appears from a category of partitions, $C=span(D)$ with $D=(D_{kl})\subset P$, via the standard implementation of partitions as linear maps. The examples abound, and the main known subgroups $G\subset U_N^+$ are either easy, or not far from being easy. We discuss here the basic theory, examples and known classification results for the easy quantum groups $G\subset U_N^+$, as well as various generalizations of the formalism, known as super-easiness theories, and the unification problem for them.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Added a new appendix and other minor changes. Comments are very welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>First, we prove an algebraization result for rig-smooth algebras over a general noetherian ring; this positively answers the question raised in [Sta24, Tag 0GAX]. Then we prove a general partial algebraization result in non-archimedean geometry. The result says that we can always algebraize a geometrically reduced affinoid rigid-analytic space in "one direction" in an appropriate sense. As an application of this result, we show the remaining cases of the Artin-Grothendieck Vanishing for affinoid algebras, which were previously conjectured in [BM21, {\S}7]. This allows us to deduce a stronger version of the rigid-analytic Artin-Grothendieck Vanishing Conjecture (see [Han20, Conj. 1.2]) over a field of characteristic 0. Using a completely different set of ideas, we also obtain a weaker version of this conjecture over a field of characteristic p>0.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $G$ a finite group, $k$ a field of prime characteristic $p$, and $S$ a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$, the Sylow permutation module $\mathrm{Ind}^G_S(k)$ plays a role in diverse facets of representation theory and group theory, ranging from Alperin's weight conjecture to statistical considerations of $S$-$S$-double cosets in $G$. The Sylow permutation module breaks up along the block decomposition of the group algebra $kG$, but the resulting block components are not invariant under splendid Morita equivalences. We introduce a summand of the block component, which we call source permutation module, which is shown to be invariant under such equivalences. We investigate general structural properties of the source permutation module and we show that well-known results relating the self-injectivity of the endomorphism algebra of the Sylow permutation to Alperin's weight conjecture carry over to the source permutation module. We calculate this module in various cases, such as certain blocks with cyclic defect group and blocks with a Klein four defect group, and for some blocks of symmetric groups, prompted by a question in a recent paper by Diaconis-Giannelli-Guralnick-Law-Navarro-Sambale-Spink on the self-injectivity of the endomorphism algebra of the Sylow permutation module for symmetric groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a $p$-adic theory of periods for 1-motives, extending the classical theory of complex periods into the non-archimedean setting. For 1-motives with good reduction over $p$-adic local fields, we construct a $p$-adic integration pairing that generalizes the Colmez--Fontaine--Messing theory for abelian varieties. This pairing is bilinear, perfect, Galois-equivariant, and compatible with the Hodge filtration, taking values in a quotient of the de Rham period ring. Building on this construction, we introduce a stratified formalism for $p$-adic periods, defining period spaces at various depths that capture increasingly refined relations among periods, and formulating conjectures that mirror the Grothendieck period conjecture in this new context. The classical period conjecture for 1-motives over $\bar{Q}$, previously resolved via the Huber--Wustholz analytic subgroup theorem, is recovered at depth 1 in our framework. For 1-motives over number fields with good reduction at $p$, we identify canonical $Q$-structures on the $p$-adic realizations arising from rational points of their associated formal $p$-divisible groups. Relative to these structures, we establish the conjectures at depths 1 and 2. A key tool is the development of a $p$-adic analytic subgroup theorem tailored to 1-motives, providing an analogue of Wustholz's classical result. Our work not only yields a $p$-adic counterpart to the Kontsevich--Zagier conjecture for 1-motives but also opens new pathways for the study of linear relations among $p$-adic periods and their transcendence properties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct two representations of the twin group $T_n, n\geq 2$, namely $\eta_1: T_n \rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbb{F}_n)$ and $\eta_2: T_n \rightarrow \text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm 1}])$, where $\mathbb{F}_n$ is a free group with $n$ generators and $t$ is indeterminate. We then analyze some characteristics of these two representations, such as irreducibility and faithfulness. Moreover, we prove that both representations can be extended to the virtual twin group $VT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 2$, and we find their $2$-local extensions. On the other hand, we obtain a different result for the welded twin group $WT_n$. More deeply, we show that $\eta_1$ cannot be extended to $WT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 3$, while $\eta_2$ can be extended to $WT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 2$, and we find its $2$-local extensions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The homology of free Lie algebras with coefficients in tensor products of the adjoint representation working over Q contains important information on the homological properties of polynomial outer functors on free groups. The latter category was introduced in joint work with Vespa, motivated by the study of higher Hochschild homology of wedges of circles. There is a splitting of this homology by polynomial degree (for polynomiality with respect to the generators of the free Lie algebra) and one can consider the polynomial degree relative to the number of tensor factors in the coefficients. It suffices to consider the Lie algebra homology in homological degree one; this vanishes in relative degree 0 and is readily calculated in relative degree 1. This paper calculates the homology in relative degree 2, which presents interesting features. This confirms a conjecture of Gadish and Hainaut.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This research introduces the Theory of Partial Symmetry Enforced Attention Decomposition (PSEAD), a new and rigorous group-theoretic framework designed to seamlessly integrate local symmetry awareness into the core architecture of self-attention mechanisms within Transformer models. We formalize the concept of local permutation subgroup actions on windows of biological data, proving that under such actions, the attention mechanism naturally decomposes into a direct sum of orthogonal irreducible components. Critically, these components are intrinsically aligned with the irreducible representations of the acting permutation subgroup, thereby providing a powerful mathematical basis for disentangling symmetric and asymmetric features. We show that PSEAD offers substantial advantages. These include enhanced generalization capabilities to novel biological motifs exhibiting similar partial symmetries, unprecedented interpretability by allowing direct visualization and analysis of attention contributions from different symmetry channels, and significant computational efficiency gains by focusing representational capacity on relevant symmetric subspaces. Beyond static data analysis, we extend PSEAD's applicability to dynamic biological processes within reinforcement learning paradigms, showcasing its potential to accelerate the discovery and optimization of biologically meaningful policies in complex environments like protein folding and drug discovery. This work lays the groundwork for a new generation of biologically informed, symmetry-aware artificial intelligence models.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Digital signatures are essential cryptographic tools that provide authentication and integrity in digital communications. However, privacy-sensitive applications, such as e-voting and digital cash, require more restrictive verification models to ensure confidentiality and control. Strong Designated Verifier Signature (SDVS) schemes address this need by enabling the signer to designate a specific verifier, ensuring that only this party can validate the signature. Existing SDVS constructions are primarily based on number-theoretic assumptions and are therefore vulnerable to quantum attacks. Although post-quantum alternatives, particularly those based on lattices, have been proposed, they often entail large key and signature sizes. In this work, we introduce $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$, a novel isogeny-based SDVS scheme that offers a compact, quantum-resistant alternative. Our construction builds on the ideal class group action framework of CSIDH and the signature techniques of CSI-FiSh, and relies on the hardness of the Multi-Target Group Action Inverse Problem (MT-GAIP). $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$ achieves strong security guarantees; namely, Strong Unforgeability under Chosen-Message Attacks (SUF-CMA), Non-Transferability (NT), and Privacy of Signer's Identity (PSI), in the random oracle model. Remarkably, both the keys and signatures in $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$ are of size $\mathcal{O}(\lambda)$, representing a significant improvement over the typical $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^2)$ bounds in existing post-quantum SDVS schemes, thereby making it among the most compact PQC-based SDVS schemes and the only post-quantum secure construction based on isogenies.</p></details>

We describe a quiver presentation for the monoid algebra $\Bbbk\mathrm{OD}_{n}$ where $\Bbbk$ is a field whose characteristic is not 2. We show that the quiver consists of two straightline paths, one with $n-1$ vertices and one with $n$ vertices, and that all compositions of consecutive arrows are equal to $0$. As part of the proof we obtain a complete description of all homomorphisms between induced left Sch\"utzenberger modules of $\Bbbk\mathrm{OD}_{n}$. We also define $\mathrm{COD}_{n}$ to be a covering of $\mathrm{OD}_{n}$ with an artificial distinction between order-preserving and order-reversing constant functions. We show that $\mathrm{COD}_{n}\simeq\mathrm{O}_{n}\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ where $\mathrm{O}_{n}$ is the monoid of all order-preserving functions on the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. Moreover, if $\Bbbk$ is a field whose characteristic is not $2$ we prove that $\Bbbk\mathrm{COD}_{n}\simeq\Bbbk\mathrm{O}_{n}\times\Bbbk\mathrm{O}_{n}$. As a corollary, we deduce that the quiver of $\Bbbk\mathrm{COD}_{n}$ consists of two straightline paths with n vertices, and that all compositions of consecutive arrows are equal to $0$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 33 pages, 1 figure. Initial article split in two parts; this part contains the irreducibility of degenerate representations

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper studies the analytic continuation of Liouville eigenstates and shows that they assemble into irreducible highest-weight representations of the Virasoro algebra, for all values of the conformal weights. This builds on previous results from the first author and Guillarmou, Kupiainen, Rhodes & Vargas, where such representations were constructed except for the conformal weight on the Kac table. In order to extend these results to the degenerate weights, we find explicit analytic expressions for the Virasoro descendants and uncover the probabilistic meaning of the Kac table. In the algebraic approach to conformal field theory, the irreducibility is a crucial property that must be satisfied by the representations in the spectrum, and is usually taken as an axiom.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we prove a quantitative version of the Oppenheim conjecture for indefinite ternary quadratic forms: for any indefinite irrational ternary quadratic form $Q$ that is not extremely well approxiable by rational forms, and for $a<b$ the number of integral vectors of norm at most $T$ satisfying $a<Q(v)<b$ is asymptotically equivalent to $\big(\mathsf{C}_Q(b-a)+\mathsf{I}_{Q}(a,b)\big)T$ as $T$ tends to infinity, where the constant $\mathsf{C}_Q>0$ depends only on $Q$, and the term $\mathsf{I}_{Q}(a,b)T$ accounts for the contribution from rational isotropic lines and degenerate planes. The main technical ingredient is a uniform bound for the $\lambda$-moment of the Margulis $\alpha$-function along expanding translates of a unipotent orbit in $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$, for some $\lambda>1$. To establish this, we introduce a new height function $\widetilde{\alpha}$ on the space of lattices, which captures the failure of the classical Margulis inequality. This moment bound implies equidistribution of such translates with respect to a class of unbounded test functions, including the Siegel transform.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the study of Euclidean lattices, the product of the successive minima is bounded from above and below by explicit quantities. This result is known as Minkowski's second theorem, and can be refined to include Hermite's constant in the upper bound, which measures how short a non-zero vector can be in a given lattice. A version of this result exists in the context of number fields, where lattices are replaced with rigid adelic spaces, and successive minima with the Roy--Thunder minima. In this paper, drawing on the analogy between rank $2$ Euclidean lattices and points in $\mathbb{H}$, we will see an analogy between $2$-dimensional rigid adelic spaces and points in $\mathbb{H}^n$, and use that to translate the Minkowski-type theorem on Roy--Thunder minima into a theorem on the distances to cusps in $\mathbb{H}^n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $q=p^m$, where $p$ is an odd prime number, we study the correlation coefficient $c(\pi;H,K)$ of an irreducible (complex) representation $\pi$ of $G={\rm GL}_2(\mathbb F_q)$ with respect to a split torus $H$ and a non-split torus $K$. We consider a family of non-split tori $K_{\alpha,u}$ indexed by $u \in \mathbb F_q$ and $\alpha \in \mathbb F_q^\times \setminus \mathbb F_q^{\times 2}$. We show that under any identification of $\mathbb C$ with $\overline{\mathbb Q}_p$, and writing $\pi = \pi_r$ where $0 \leq r \leq (q-1)/2$ depending on this identification, we have $$c(\pi_r;H,K_{\alpha,u}) \equiv [P_r(u/\sqrt{\alpha})]^2 \mod p, $$ where $P_r(X) \in \mathbb Z[\frac{1}{2}][X]$ is the $r$-th Legendre polynomial. As a corollary, when $m \geq 2$, we prove that there exists $u \in \mathbb F_q^\times$ such that $c(\pi;H,K_{\alpha,u}) \neq 0$ for all irreducible representations $\pi$ of $G$ admitting fixed vectors for both $H$ and $K$.</p></details>

For comparison, it is known that the non-vanishing proportion is at least 25% for the central $L$-values $L (1/2, f)$. Further, 33% may be raised to 50% conditionally on the generalized Riemann hypothesis. Moreover, we prove non-vanishing results on short intervals $|t_f-T| \leqslant T^{\mu}$ for any $0 < \mu < 1$. However, it is a curious case that the Riemann hypothesis does not yield better result for small $0 < \mu \leqslant 1/2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The well-known sequence $\vartheta_n = \vartheta(p_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \ln p_i= \ln\left([p_n]\#\right)$ exhibits numerous extremely interesting properties. Since $p_n = \exp(\vartheta_n - \vartheta_{n-1})$, it is immediately clear that the two sequences $p_n \longleftrightarrow \vartheta_n$ must ultimately encode exactly the same information. But the sequence $\vartheta_n$, while being extremely closely correlated with the primes, (in fact, $\vartheta_n \sim p_n$), is very much better behaved than the primes themselves. Using numerous suitable extensions of various reasonably standard results, I shall demonstrate that the sequence $\vartheta_n$ satisfies suitably defined $\vartheta$-analogues of the usual Cramer, Andrica, Legendre, Oppermann, Brocard, Firoozbakht, Fourges, Nicholson, and Farhadian conjectures. (So these $\vartheta$-analogues are not conjectures, they are instead theorems.) The crucial key to enabling this pleasant behaviour is the regularity (and relative smallness) of the $\theta$-gaps $\mathfrak{g}_n = \vartheta_{n+1}-\vartheta_n= \ln p_{n+1}$. While superficially these results bear close resemblance to some recently derived results for the averaged primes, $\bar p_n = {1\over n} \sum_{i=1}^n p_i$, both the broad outline and the technical details of the arguments given and proofs presented are quite radically distinct.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 28 pages, LaTeX

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Co-oriented contact manifolds quite generally describe classical dynamical systems. Quantization is achieved by suitably associating a Schr\"odinger equation to every path in the contact manifold. We quantize the standard contact seven sphere by treating it as a homogeneous space of the quaternionic unitary group in order to construct a contact analog of Fedosov's formal connection on symplectic spinor bundles. We show that requiring convergence of the formal connection naturally filters the symplectic spinor bundle and yields an exact flat connection on each corresponding subbundle. A key ingredient is a generalization of the Holstein--Primakoff mechanism to the quaternionic unitary group. The passage from formal to bona fide quantization determines unitary irreducible representations of the quaternionic unitary group, whose dimensions tend to infinity as the formal deformation parameter approaches its classical limit. This appearance of finite-dimensional representations is not surprising since the contact seven sphere is closed and physically describes generalized positions, momenta and time variables.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we construct the permutation modules and Young modules for Brauer algebras of type $C$ by extending the representation theory of the group algebra of hyperoctahedral groups. Additionally, we develop a stratifying system for Brauer algebras of type $C$, thereby extending the work of Hemmer-Nakano in \cite{HN} on Hecke algebras. This framework allows us to determine when the multiplicities of cell modules in any filtration are well-defined. As a result, we prove that if the characteristic of the field is neither $2$ nor $3$, then every permutation module of the Brauer algebra of type $C$ decomposes into a direct sum of indecomposable Young modules. We also establish certain cohomological criteria for the group algebra of the hyperoctahedral groups, which are necessary to prove the results for the Brauer algebras of type $C$.</p></details>

Motivated by this geometry, we conjecture that whenever two Bruhat intervals are isomorphic, there exists an isomorphism realized by a piecewise isometry. We prove this when both endpoints are dominant in $\widetilde{A}_2$ and obtain partial results in $\widetilde{A}_n$. In the course of proving these results, we made the surprising observation that much of the information contained in a Bruhat interval is already encoded in a tiny portion of it.</p></details>

A loop analogue of an arithmetic group is also shown to act continuously on the bordification and its quotient by this action is studied using the reduction theory of H. Garland. While the quotient is no longer compact (as in the Borel--Serre construction from finite-dimensions) we relate the non-compactness to the center of the loop group. We also introduce a notion of semi-stability for loop groups, following works of Harder--Narasimhan, Behrend, and most recently Chaudouard, and use this to describe a partition of our loop symmetric space.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>One of the main objectives of topological data analysis is the study of discrete invariants for persistence modules, in particular when dealing with multiparameter persistence modules. In many cases, the invariants studied for these non-totally ordered posets $P$ can be obtained from restricting a given module to a subposet $X$ of $P$ that is totally ordered (or more generally, of finite representation type), and then computing the barcode (or the general direct sum decomposition) over $X$. We consider in this paper general order-preserving embeddings of representation-finite subposets $X$ into $P$ and study systematically the invariants obtained by decomposing the restriction of a given $P$-module $M$ to $X$ into its indecomposable summands. The restriction functor from $\mathrm{mod}\ P$ to $\mathrm{mod}\ X$ is well-studied, and it is known to be exact and admits both left and right adjoint functors, known as induction and co-induction functors. This allows us to obtain new homological insights, and also to re-interpret previous results. We use this approach also to determine bases of the image of these invariants, thus generalizing the concept of signed barcodes which is considered in the literature in relation to stability results. It turns out that considering only order-embeddings of one fixed poset $X$ into the poset $P$, and studying the set of all indecomposables obtained from $X$ introduces a lot of redundancy. We therefore also study iterated embeddings of several posets of increasing sizes, while limiting attention to only some indecomposables (that have not been obtained from embedding of smaller posets previously).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We characterize all algebraic numbers $\alpha$ of degree $d\in\{4,5,6,7\}$ for which there exist four distinct algebraic conjugates $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, $\alpha_3$, $\alpha_4$ of $\alpha$ satisfying the relation $\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}=\alpha_{3}+\alpha_{4}$. In particular, we prove that an algebraic number $\alpha$ of degree 6 satisfies this relation with $\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}\notin\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if $\alpha$ is the sum of a quadratic and a cubic algebraic number. Moreover, we describe all possible Galois groups of the normal closure of $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ for such algebraic numbers $\alpha$. We also consider similar relations $\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}+\alpha_{3}+\alpha_{4}=0$ and $\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}+\alpha_{3}=\alpha_{4}$ for algebraic numbers of degree up to 7.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use the approach to $p$-adic cohomology theories via stacks recently developed by Drinfeld and Bhatt--Lurie to formulate a stacky version of a comparison result between the Nygaard filtration on prismatic cohomology and the Hodge filtration on de Rham cohomology by Bhatt--Lurie and thereby also obtain a generalisation in the case of smooth and proper $p$-adic formal schemes which allows for coefficients in an arbitrary gauge. In the process, we develop a stacky approach to diffracted Hodge cohomology as introduced by Bhatt--Lurie which also captures the conjugate filtration and the Sen operator. In the appendix, we also introduce a stack computing the conjugate filtration on absolute Hodge--Tate cohomology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical Cayley transform is a birational map between a quadratic matrix group and its Lie algebra, which was first discovered by Cayley in 1846. Because of its essential role in both pure and applied mathematics, the classical Cayley transform has been generalized from various perspectives. This paper is concerned with a representation theoretic generalization of the classical Cayley transform. The idea underlying this work is that the applicability of the classical Cayley transform heavily depends on how the Lie group is represented. The goal is to characterize irreducible representations of a Lie group, to which the classical Cayley transform is applicable. To this end, we first establish criteria of the applicability for a general Lie group. If the group is semisimple, we further obtain a geometric condition on the weight diagram of such representations. Lastly, we provide a complete classification for classical complex simple Lie groups and their compact real forms. Except for the previously known examples, spin representations of $\mathrm{Spin}(8)$ are the only ones on our list.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the $p$-adic and $\ell$-adic monodromy operators associated with hyper-K\"ahler varieties over $p$-adic fields, in connection with Looijenga-Lunts-Verbitsky Lie algebras. We investigate a conjectural relation between the nilpotency indices of these monodromy operators on higher-degree cohomology groups and on the second cohomology, which may be viewed as an arithmetic analogue of Nagai's conjecture for degenerations of hyper-K\"ahler manifolds over a disk. We verify this arithmetic version of Nagai's conjecture for hyper-K\"ahler varieties over $p$-adic fields, assuming they belong to one of the four known deformation types. As part of our approach, we introduce a new method to analyze the $p$-adic cohomology of hyper-K\"ahler varieties via Sen's theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{g}_{\bar0}+\mathfrak{g}_{\bar1}$ be a basic classical Lie superalgebra over $\mathbb{C}$, and $e=e_{\theta}\in\mathfrak{g}_{\bar0}$ with $-\theta$ being a minimal root of $\mathfrak{g}$. Set $U(\mathfrak{g},e)$ to be the minimal finite $W$-superalgebras associated with the pair $(\mathfrak{g},e)$. In this paper we study the highest weight theory for $U(\mathfrak{g},e)$, introduce the Verma modules and give a complete isomorphism classification of finite-dimensional irreducible modules, via the parameter set consisting of pairs of weights and levels. Those Verma modules can be further described via parabolic induction from Whittaker modules for $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ or $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ respectively, depending on the detecting parity of $\textsf{r}:=\dim\mathfrak{g}(-1)_{\bar1}$. We then introduce and investigate the BGG category $\mathcal{O}$ for $U(\mathfrak{g},e)$, establishing highest weight theory, as a counterpart of the works for finite $W$-algebras by Brundan-Goodwin-Kleshchev and Losev, respectively. In comparison with the non-super case, the significant difference here lies in the situation when $\textsf{r}$ is odd, which is a completely new phenomenon. The difficulty and complicated computation arise from there.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A generalization of the well-known Fibonacci sequence is the $k$-Fibonacci sequence with some fixed integer $k\ge 2$. The first $k$ terms of this sequence are $0,0, \ldots, 1$, and each term afterwards is the sum of the preceding $k$ terms. In this paper, we find all Pell numbers that can be written as a product of two $k$-Fibonacci numbers. The proof of our main theorem uses lower bounds for linear forms in logarithms, properties of continued fractions, and a variation of a result of Dujella and Peth\H{o} in Diophantine approximation. This work generalizes a prior result of Alekseyev which dealt with determining the intersection of the Fibonacci and Pell sequences, a work of Ddamulira, Luca and Rakotomalala who searched for Pell numbers which are products of two Fibonacci numbers, and a result of Bravo, G\'omez, and Herrera, who found all Pell numbers appearing in the $k$-Fibonacci sequence.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate pairs $(G,Y)$, where $G$ is a reductive algebraic group and $Y$ a purely-odd $G$-superscheme, asking when a pair corresponds to a quasi-reductive algebraic supergroup $\mathbb{G}$, that is, $\mathbb{G}_{\text{ev}}$ is isomorphic to $G$, and the quotient $\mathbb{G}\slash \mathbb{G}_{\text{ev}}$ is $G$-equivariantly isomorphic to $Y$. We prove that, if $Y$ satisfies certain conditions (basic quasi-reductive root data), then the question has a positive answer given by an existence and uniqueness theorem. The corresponding supergroups are said to be basic quasi-reductive, which can be classified, up to isogeny. We then decide the structure of connected quasi-reductive algebraic supergroups provided that: (i) the root system does not contain $0$; (ii) $\mathfrak{g}:=\text{Lie}(\mathbb{G})$ admits a non-degenerate even symmetric bilinear form. (iii) all odd reflections are invertible. Remarkably, those supergroups are exactly basic quasi-reductive supergroups of monodromy type.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As a sequel to [Duan-Shu-Yao], we introduce here a category $\mathscr{LC}$ arising from the BGG category $\mathcal{O}$ defined in [Duan-Shu-Yao] for Lie algebras of polynomial vector fields. The objects of $\mathscr{LC}$ are so-called Lie-Cartan modules which admit both Lie-module structure and compatible $R$-module structure ($R$ denotes the corresponding polynomial ring). This terminology is natural, coming from affine connections in differential geometry through which the structure sheaves in topology and the vector fields in geometry are integrated for differential manifolds. In this paper, we study Lie-Cartan modules and their categorical and cohomology properties. The category $\mathscr{LC}$ is abelian, and a ``highest weight category" with depths. Notably, the set of co-standard objects in the category $\mathcal{O}$ turns out to represent the isomorphism classes of simple objects of $\mathscr{LC}$. We then establish the cohomology for this category (called the $\mathscr{uLC}$-cohomology), extending Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology theory. Another notable result says that in the fundamental case $\mathfrak{g}= W(n)$, the extension ring $\text{Ext}^\bullet_{\mathscr{uLC}}(R,R)$ for the polynomial algebra $R$ in the $\mathscr{uLC}$-cohomology is isomorphic to the usual cohomology ring $H^\bullet(\mathfrak{gl}(n))$ of the general linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Standard prime-number counting functions, such as $\psi(x)$, $\theta(x)$, and $\pi(x)$, have error terms with limiting logarithmic distributions once suitably normalized. The same is true of weighted versions of those sums, like $\pi_r(x) = \sum_{p\le x} \frac1p$ and $\pi_\ell(x) = \sum_{p\le x} \log(1-\frac1p)^{-1}$, that were studied by Mertens. These limiting distributions are all identical, but passing to the limit loses information about how these error terms are correlated with one another. In this paper, we examine these correlations, showing, for example, that persistent inequalities between certain pairs of normalized error terms are equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis (RH). Assuming both RH and LI, the linear independence of the positive imaginary parts of the zeros of $\zeta(s)$, we calculate the logarithmic densities of the set of real numbers for which two different error terms have prescribed signs. For example, we conditionally show that $\psi(x) - x$ and $\sum_{n\le x} \frac{\Lambda(n)}n - (\log x - C_0)$ have the same sign on a set of logarithmic density $\approx 0.9865$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Without using the $p$-adic Langlands correspondence, we prove that for many finite length smooth representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Q}_p)$ on $p$-torsion modules the $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Q}_p)$-linear morphisms coincide with the morphisms that are linear for the normalizer of a parahoric subgroup. We identify this subgroup to be the Iwahori subgroup in the supersingular case, and $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Z}_p)$ in the principal series case. As an application, we relate the action of parahoric subgroups to the action of the inertia group of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbf{Q}}_p/\mathbf{Q}_p)$, and we prove that if an irreducible Banach space representation $\Pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Q}_p)$ has infinite $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Z}_p)$-length then a twist of $\Pi$ has locally algebraic vectors. This answers a question of Dospinescu. We make the simplifying assumption that $p > 3$ and that all our representations are generic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The 2-switch-degree of $G$ is the number of distinct 2-switches acting on a graph $G$. In this work we study structural properties of the 2-switch-degree, with a focus on split graphs. Our approach is motivated by the Tyshkevich decomposition, which uniquely expresses any graph as a composition $G_r \circ \ldots \circ G_1$ of irreducible graphs, where $G_2, \ldots, G_r$ are split. Our key tool is the factor graph $\Phi(S)$, a multigraph associated with a split graph $S$ that encodes 2-switch-degree information via edge multiplicities between independet vertices of $S$. By leveraging $\Phi(S)$, we reduce the problem of classifying irreducible split graphs to enumerating and analyzing unlabeled connected multigraphs of fixed size. Using this method, we fully classify irreducible split graphs of degrees 1, 2, 3, and 4. Further, we introduce and investigate the $\Delta$-property, a surprising connection between Graph Theory and Number Theory that arises from $n$-simple triangles (3-cycles with uniform edge multiplicity $n$) of the factor graph.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tony Feng, Benjamin Howard, Mikayel Mkrtchyan &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the higher Siegel--Weil formula for \emph{corank one} terms, relating (1) the $r^{\rm th}$ central derivatives of corank one Fourier coefficients of Siegel--Eisenstein series, and (2) the degrees of special cycles of virtual dimension 0 on the moduli stack of Hermitian shtukas with $r$ legs. Notably, the formula holds for all $r$, regardless of the order of vanishing of the Eisenstein series. This extends earlier work of Feng--Yun--Zhang, who proved the higher Siegel--Weil formula for the non-singular (corank zero) terms.</p></details>
