<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p>0$ be a prime, $G$ be a finite $p$-group and $\Bbbk$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p$. Dave Benson has conjectured that if $p=2$ and $V$ is an odd-dimensional indecomposable representation of $G$ then all summands of the tensor product $V \otimes V^*$ except for $\Bbbk$ have even dimension. It is known that the analogous result for general $p$ is false. In this paper, we investigate the class of graded representations $V$ which have dimension coprime to $p$ and for which $V \otimes V^*$ has a non-trivial summand of dimension coprime to $p$, for a graded group scheme closely related to $\mathbb{Z}/p^r \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/p^s \mathbb{Z}$, where $r$ and $s$ are nonnegative integers and $p>2$. We produce an infinite family of such representations in characteristic 3 and show in particular that the tensor subcategory generated by any of these representations in the semisimplification contains the modulo $3$ reduction of the category of representations of the symmetric group $S_3$. Our results are compatible with a general version of Benson's conjecture due to Etingof.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ronald Solodov &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove for a morphism $f \colon X \rightarrow S$ locally of $^+$weakly finite type, separated and taut, where $X$ is a weakly square complete adic space and $S$ a square complete and stable adic space, there exists a universal vertical compactification $f' \colon X' \rightarrow S$. This provides a generalized version of Huber's proof of universal compactification of morphisms between analytic adic spaces. Notably, we will see that for the compactification, it is not necessary to assume that the adic spaces are locally Noetherian. In the fourth section we give an explicit and simple construction of $X'$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a combinatorial approach to counting the number of spanning trees at the $n$-th layer of a branched $\mathbb{Z}_p$-cover of a finite connected graph $\mathsf{X}$. Our method achieves in explaining how the position of the ramified vertices affects the count and hence the Iwasawa invariants. We do so by introducing the notion of segments, segmental decomposition of a graph, and number of segmental $t$-tree spanning forests.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this second part we prove that, if $G$ is one of the groups $\mathrm{PSL}_2(q)$ with $q>5$ and $q\equiv 5\pmod {24}$ or $q\equiv 13 \pmod{24}$, then the fundamental group of every acyclic $2$-dimensional, fixed point free and finite $G$-complex admits a nontrivial representation in a unitary group $\mathrm{U}(m)$. This completes the proof of the following result: every action of a finite group on a finite and contractible $2$-complex has a fixed point.</p></details>

> **Comment:** To appear in Inventiones mathematicae

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this series of two articles, we prove that every action of a finite group $G$ on a finite and contractible $2$-complex has a fixed point. The proof goes by constructing a nontrivial representation of the fundamental group of each of the acyclic $2$-dimensional $G$-complexes constructed by Oliver and Segev. In the first part we develop the necessary theory and cover the cases where $G=\mathrm{PSL}_2(2^n)$, $G=\mathrm{PSL}_2(q)$ with $q\equiv 3\pmod 8$ or $G=\mathrm{Sz}(2^n)$. The cases $G=\mathrm{PSL}_2(q)$ with $q\equiv 5\pmod 8$ are addressed in the second part.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sven Balnojan, Claus Hertling &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 61 pages, 4 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Isolated hypersurface singularities come equipped with distinguished bases of their Milnor lattices and with upper triangular integral matrices, which are called here distinguished matrices. These matrices form an orbit of a braid group and a sign change group. This paper proposes to characterize the distinguished matrices of singularities within all upper triangular integral matrices in terms of the variance of certain spectral numbers. It succeeds in the positive definite and the positive semidefinite cases. The ADE root lattices are crucial. In the semidefinite cases, results on non-reduced presentations of Weyl group elements are used.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jan Fornal &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DS &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper resolves the question of pointwise convergence for ergodic averages of a single function along the set of polynomial values of primes of the form $x^2 + ny^2$. Following the influential paper of Bourgain \cite{bourgain1989pointwise}, we employ the Hardy-Littlewood circle method where major arc and minor arc estimates for the set of prime ideals constitute the main novelty of the paper. We also prove that our convergence results cannot be extended to class of $L^1$ functions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 56 pages, to appear in Compos. Math

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study certain categories associated to symmetric quivers with potential, called quasi-BPS categories. We construct semiorthogonal decompositions of the categories of matrix factorizations for moduli stacks of representations of (framed or unframed) symmetric quivers with potential, where the summands are categorical Hall products of quasi-BPS categories. These results generalize our previous results about the three loop quiver. We prove several properties of quasi-BPS categories: wall-crossing equivalence, strong generation, and categorical support lemma in the case of tripled quivers with potential. We also introduce reduced quasi-BPS categories for preprojective algebras, which have trivial relative Serre functor and are indecomposable when the weight is coprime with the total dimension. In this case, we regard the reduced quasi-BPS categories as noncommutative local hyperk\"ahler varieties, and as (twisted) categorical versions of crepant resolutions of singularities of good moduli spaces of representations of preprojective algebras. The studied categories include the local models of quasi-BPS categories of K3 surfaces. In a follow-up paper, we establish analogous properties for quasi-BPS categories of K3 surfaces.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10003v3'>2412.10003</a>\]&nbsp; **Parabolic restrictions and double deformations of weight multiplicities**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Cédric Lecouvey &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce some (p,q)-deformations of the weight multiplicities for the representations of any simple Lie algebra g over the complex numbers. This is done by associating the indeterminate q to the positive roots of a parabolic subsystem of g and the indeterminate p to the remaining positive roots. When p=q, we just recover the usual Lusztig analogues of weight multiplicities. We then study the positivity of the coefficients in these double deformations. In particular, the positivity holds when p=1 in which case the polynomials have a natural algebraic interpretation in terms of a parabolic Brylinski filtration. For the parabolic restriction from type C to type A, this positivity result was conjectured by Lee. We also establish this positivity, in any finite type and for any p, for a stabilized version of our double deformation.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 67 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Igusa varieties over the special fibre of Shimura varieties have demonstrated many applications to the Langlands program via Mantovan's formula and Shin's point counting method. In this paper we study Igusa varieties over the moduli stack of global $\Gscr$-shtukas and (under certain conditions) calculate the Hecke action on its cohomology. As part of their construction we prove novel results about local $G$-shtukas in both equal and unequal characteristic and also discuss application of these results to Barsotti-Tate groups and Shimura varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In previous papers, the Galois module structure of minus class groups was studied for abelian CM extensions. In this paper, we discuss some nonabelian cases, focusing on metacyclic extensions. For a certain class of these, we obtain a complete description of the Galois modules that occur as minus class groups, modulo a certain equivalence relation on modules, which was introduced earlier by the same authors.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Minor changes made. The definition of M in the introduction is clarified and Remark 1.1 is added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, the first author as well as the second author with Ono, Pujahari, and Saikia determined the limiting distribution of values of certain finite field ${_2F_1}$ and ${_3F_2}$ hypergeometric functions. These hypergeometric values are related to Frobenius traces of elliptic curves and their limiting distribution is determined using connections to the theory of modular forms and harmonic Maass forms. Here we determine the limiting distribution of values of some ${_4F_3}$ hypergeometric functions which are sums of traces of Frobenius for a pair of elliptic curves. To obtain this result, we generalize Michel's work on Sato-Tate laws for families of elliptic curves to the setting of pairs of families, and we show that a generic pair admits an independent Sato-Tate distribution as the finite field grows. To this end, we use various results from the theory of \'etale cohomology, Deligne's work on the Weil conjectures, and the work of Katz on monodromy groups. In the cases previously studied using modular methods, we elucidate the connection between the modular forms that appear and the machinery of \'etale cohomology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this note, we initiate the study of generating functions for tight cylindric partitions. For general (i.e., $r$-rowed for $r\geq 2$) tight cylindric partitions, we provide analogs of the Corteel--Welsh functional equations. We prove closed forms for the bivariate generating functions for 2-rowed tight cylindric partitions. We also show that these partitions are in bijection with a class of partitions studied by Dousse, Hardiman, and Konan.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a natural extension to complex numbers of the standard continued fractions. The basic algorithm is due to Lagrange and Gauss, though it seems to have gone mostly unnoticed as a way to create continued fractions. The new representations are shown to be unique, and to have useful properties. They also admit a geometric cutting sequence interpretation.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 44 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study five pencils of projective quartic Delsarte K3 surfaces. Over finite fields, we give explicit formulas for the point counts of each family, written in terms of hypergeometric sums. Over the complex numbers, we match the periods of the corresponding family with hypergeometric differential operators and series. We also obtain a decomposition of the $L$-function of each pencil in terms of hypergeometric $L$-series and Dedekind zeta functions. This gives an explicit description of the hypergeometric motives geometrically realised by each pencil.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that there exist infinitely many elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$ with $j$-invariant $1728$ and rank exactly $2$ which are not obtained by base change from $\mathbb{Q}$. The rank of each such curve is determined via 2-isogeny descent, and the existence of infinitely many such curves follows from Tao's constellation theorem for Gaussian primes.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages, submitted for publication

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is shown that two conjectures put forward in the recent article Iksanov and Kostohryz (2025) are true. Namely, we prove a functional central limit theorem (FCLT) and a law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) for a random Dirichlet series $\sum_p \frac{\eta_p}{p^{1/2+s}}$ as $s\to 0+$, where $\eta_1$, $\eta_2,\ldots$ are independent identically distributed random variables with zero mean and finite variance, and $\sum_p$ denotes the summation over the prime numbers. As a consequence, an FCLT and an LIL are obtained for $\log \sum_{n\geq 1} \frac{f(n)}{n^{1/2+s}}$ as $s\to 0+$, where $f$ is a Rademacher random multiplicative function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f_t$ be a one-parameter family of rational maps defined over a number field $K$. We show that for all $t$ outside of a set of natural density zero, every $K$-rational preperiodic point of $f_t$ is the specialization of some $K(T)$-rational preperiodic point of $f$. Assuming a weak form of the Uniform Boundedness Conjecture, we also calculate the average number of $K$-rational preperiodic points of $f$, giving some examples where this holds unconditionally. To illustrate the theory, we give new estimates on the average number of preperiodic points for the quadratic family $f_t(z) = z^2 + t$ over the field of rational numbers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 31 pages. Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a mutation theory for quivers with oriented 2-cycles using a structure called a homotopy, defined as a normal subgroupoid of the quiver's fundamental groupoid. This framework extends Fomin-Zelevinsky mutations of 2-acyclic quivers and yields involutive mutations that preserve the fundamental groupoid quotient by the homotopy. It generalizes orbit mutations arising from quiver coverings and allows for infinite mutation sequences even when orbit mutations are obstructed. We further construct quivers with homotopies from triangulations of marked surfaces with colored punctures, and prove that flips correspond to mutations, extending the Fomin-Shapiro-Thurston model to the setting with 2-cycles.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{F}_n$ be the set of unitary cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n$ over a number field $F$, and let $\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathfrak{F}_n$ be a finite subset. Given $\pi_0\in\mathfrak{F}_{n_0}$, we establish large sieve inequalities for the families $\{L(s,\pi)\colon \pi\in\mathcal{S}\}$ and $\{L(s,\pi\times\pi_0)\colon \pi\in\mathcal{S}\}$ that, unlike previous results, are independent of progress towards the generalized Ramanujan conjecture and simultaneously handle the Dirichlet coefficients of $L$, $L^{-1}$, and $\log L$. Our approach is based on the duality principle and is sharp in ranges that are complementary to large sieve inequalities based on trace formulae. We apply our large sieve inequalities to establish several density estimates for families of $L$-functions, counting potential violations of the generalized Riemann hypothesis and the generalized Ramanujan conjecture. In particular, we remove all restrictions in the log-free zero density estimate of Brumley, Thorner, and Zaman for families of Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions.</p></details>

We hypothesize that this property can be generalized to hold for other $a$ as well.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the entropy of the Serre functor $\mathbb{S}$ in the partially wrapped Fukaya category of a graded surface $\Sigma$ with stops is given by the function sending $t \in \mathbb{R}$ to $ h_t(\mathbb{S}) = (1-\min \Omega)t$, for $t\geq 0$, and to $h_t(\mathbb{S})=(1-\max \Omega)t$, for $t\leq 0$, where $\Omega = \{\frac{\omega_1}{m_1} \ldots, \frac{\omega_b}{m_b},0\}$, and $\omega_i$ is the winding number of the $i$th boundary component $\partial_i\Sigma$ of the surface with $b$ boundary components and $m_i$ stops on $\partial_i \Sigma$. It then follows that the upper and lower Serre dimensions are given by $1-\min \Omega$ and $1-\max \Omega$, respectively. Furthermore, in the case of a finite dimensional gentle algebra $A$, we show that a Gromov-Yomdin-like equality holds by relating the categorical entropy of the Serre functor of the perfect derived category of $A$ to the logarithm of the spectral radius of the Coxeter transformation.</p></details>

The constant $E_{A,B}$ is defined to be the smallest positive integer $k$ such that every sequence of length $k$ in $\mathbb Z_n$ has an $(A,B)$-weighted zero-sum subsequence of length $n$. A sequence in $\mathbb Z_n$ of length $E_{A,B}-1$ which does not have any $(A,B)$-weighted zero-sum subsequence of length $n$ is called an $E$-extremal sequence for $(A,B)$. We determine the constant $E_{A,B}$ and characterize the $E$-extremal sequences for some pairs $(A,B)$.

> **Comment:** Accepted for publication in Mathematika; revised according to referee comments

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given two subsets $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p$ and a binary relation $\mathcal{R} \subseteq A \times B$, the restricted sumset of $A, B$ with respect to $\mathcal{R}$ is defined as $A +_{\mathcal{R}} B = \{ a+b \colon (a,b) \notin \mathcal{R} \}$. When $\mathcal{R}$ is taken as the equality relation, determining the minimum value of $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} B|$ is the famous Erd\H{o}s--Heilbronn problem, which was solved separately by Dias da Silva, Hamidoune and Alon, Nathanson and Ruzsa. Lev later conjectured that if $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p$ with $|A| + |B| \le p$ and $\mathcal{R}$ is a matching between subsets of $A$ and $B$, then $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} B| \ge |A| + |B| - 3$. We confirm this conjecture in the case where $|A| + |B| \le (1-\varepsilon)p$ for any $\varepsilon > 0$, provided that $p > p_0$ for some sufficiently large $p_0$ depending only on $\varepsilon$. Our proof builds on a recent work by Bollob\'as, Leader, and Tiba, and a rectifiability argument developed by Green and Ruzsa. Furthermore, our method extends to cases when $\mathcal{R}$ is a degree-bounded relation, either on both sides $A$ and $B$ or solely on the smaller set. In addition, we construct subsets $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p$ with $|A| = \frac{6p}{11} - O(1)$ such that $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} A| = p-3$ for any prime number $p$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is a matching on $A$. This extends an earlier construction by Lev and highlights a distinction between the combinatorial notion of the restricted sumset and the classcial Erd\H{o}s--Heilbronn problem, where $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} A| \ge p$ holds given $\mathcal{R} = \{(a,a) \colon a \in A\}$ is the equality relation on $A$ and $|A| \ge \frac{p+3}{2}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma=0.577215\ldots$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta=0.596347\ldots$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that these two numbers are disjunctively transcendental; that is, at least one of them must be transcendental. The two constants are related through a well-known equation of Hardy, which recently has been generalized to a pair of infinite sequences ($\gamma^{\left(n\right)}$,$\delta^{\left(n\right)}$) based on moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution. In the present work, we demonstrate the algebraic independence of the set $\{\tfrac{\delta^{\left(n\right)}}{e}+\gamma^{\left(n\right)}\}_{n\geq0}$, and thus the transcendence of $\tfrac{\delta^{\left(n\right)}}{e}+\gamma^{\left(n\right)}$ for all $n\geq0$. This further implies the disjunctive-transcendence of each pair ($\gamma^{\left(n\right)}$,$\tfrac{\delta^{\left(n\right)}}{e}$).</p></details>

This functor plays an important role in the theory of mod $p$ representations of $p$-adic reductive groups. A key ingredient for our proof is a comparison between certain small and parabolic inductions. Additionally, our method yields an explicit description of Vign\'eras' right adjoint to parabolic induction. In the appendix (joint with Heyer) we apply our results to obtain a mod $p$ variant of Bernstein's Second Adjointness, i.e. we show that the right and left adjoint of derived parabolic induction are isomorphic (on complexes with admissible cohomology) up to a cohomological shift and twist by a character.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the homogeneous $2$-local representations of the twin group $T_n$ for all integers $n\geqslant 2$. A complete classification is obtained, yielding three distinct families of representations. We show that each of these families is reducible by explicitly constructing one-dimensional invariant subspaces, with particular emphasis on the first family, namely $\xi_1: T_n \rightarrow \text{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$. Passing to the corresponding quotients, we construct a reduced representation of $\xi_1$, namely $\tilde{\xi}_1: T_n \rightarrow \text{GL}_{n-1}(\mathbb{C})$. The core of the paper is that we establish, through a precise criterion, a necessary and sufficient condition for the irreducibility of the representation $\tilde{\xi}_1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a condensable algebra in a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$. We define an action of the fusion category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ on the morphism space Hom$_{\mathcal{C}}(x,A)$ for any $x$ in $\mathcal{C}$, whose characters are generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\mathcal{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\mathcal{B}$ to $A^\mathcal{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOA, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\mathcal{C}_A}$ where $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{M}_U$ is the $U$-module category. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\mathcal{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$</p></details>

In this paper we define the class of UMP algebras and develop algebraic combinatorics tools in order to present a characterization of this class of algebras which are locally monomial (see Definition 4.1) and special multiserial algebras. Among other things, we describe the ramifications graph of symmetric special biserial algebras and we classify which of them are UMP algebras in terms of their bound quivers and their associated Brauer graphs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A vector partition problem asks for a number of nonnegative integer solutions to a system of several linear Diophantine equations with integer nonnegative coefficients. J.J. Sylvester put forward an idea of reduction of vector partition to a sum of scalar partitions. In the simplest case of two equations with positive coefficients A. Cayley performed a reduction of the corresponding double partition to a sum of scalar partitions using an algorithm subject to a set of conditions on the coefficients. We suggested a modification of the original Cayley algorithm for the cases when these conditions are not satisfied. This result is extended to arbitrary number of the Diophantine equations to accomplish the Sylvester program of the vector partition reduction to a combination of scalar partitions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the triple convolution sum of the divisor function given by $$\sum_{n\leq x} d(n)d(n-h)d(n+h)$$ for $h\neq 0$ and $d(n)$ denotes the number of positive divisors of $n$. Based on algebraic and geometric considerations, Browning conjectured that the above sum is asymptotic to $c_hx(\log x)^3$, for a suitable constant $c_h\neq 0$, as $x\to \infty$. This conjecture is still unproved. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, we show that there are positive constants $A,B$ such that $$Ax(\log x)^3 \leq \sum_{n\leq x} d(n)d(n-h)d(n+h) \leq Bx(\log x)^3,$$ as $x\to \infty$. Second, we provide theoretical basis for Browning's conjectured constant $c_h$ emanating from the theory of Dirichlet series of several complex variables.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Substantial revision of previous version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The core of the Taylor-Wiles and Taylor-Wiles-Kisin method in proving modularity lifting theorems is the construction of Taylor-Wiles primes satisfying certain conditions relating automorphic side and Galois side. In this article, we construct such primes and develop the automorphic side of Taylor-Wiles method for definite special orthogonal or symplectic groups $G$ over a totally real number field $F$, beyond the only known case for definite unitary groups (except for $\mathrm{GSp}_4$). As an application of our result, we prove a minimal $R=\mathbb{T}$ theorem for $G$, extending the scope of modularity lifting results to this setting. As a direct consequence, we deduce the Bloch--Kato conjecture for the adjoint of the Galois representation $r_\pi$ associated to an automorphic representation $\pi$ of $G(\mathbb{A}_F)$. Our approach combines deformation theory with automorphic methods, providing new evidence towards the Langlands program for orthogonal and symplectic groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Keating--Snaith conjecture for orthogonal families may be viewed as analogous to a Gaussian distribution with a negative mean, and the possibility that mixed moments resemble a composition of independent moments, these two insights were combined and applied in Lester and Radziwi\l\l's proof of quantum unique ergodicity for half-integral weight automorphic forms, via Soundararajan's method under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH). This observation also yields a crucial and nontrivial saving in the resolution of certain arithmetic problems. Inspired by this, we select a series of typical mixed orthogonal families of $L$-functions: $\mathrm{GL}_2$ quadratic twisted families. Under the assumptions of the GRH and the Generalized Ramanujan Conjecture, we prove upper bound estimates for their moments and present the following three arithmetic applications: i) The decorrelation of automorphic periods averaged over imaginary quadratic fields. ii) The decorrelation of Fourier coefficients of half-integral weight modular forms. iii) The decorrelation of the analytic orders of isotropy subgroups of Tate--Shafarevich groups of elliptic curves under quadratic twists.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a linear algebraic group defined over an algebraically closed field $k$, and let $V$ be a vector space on which $G$ acts linearly. The separating variety $\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ is the subvariety of $V^2$ consisting of pairs of points indistinguishable by invariant polynomials in $k[V]^G$. Its geometry places restrictions on the existence of small separating sets, i.e. sets of invariants which distinguish the same points as the full algebra of invariants. The purpose of this article is to study the separating variety in the important special case where $G=\mathrm{GL}_p(\mathbb{C})$ acts on the set $V$ of $n$-tuples of $p \times p$ matrices by simultaneous conjugation. We define a purely combinatorial poset, $\mathcal{P}_{p,n}$, whose maximal elements are in 1-1 correspondence with the irreducible components of $\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$. We show that $\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ is a variety of dimension $(n+1)p^2-1$, and determine its subdimension for all $n$ and $p$. In particular we show the subdimension is $(n+1)p^2-p$ if $n \geq 3$, or $n \geq 2$ and $p \geq 4$. In the case $n \geq 3$, we give a formula for the number of components of given codimension in $\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$. We give explicit decompositions of $\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ for all $n$ where $p=2,3$ or $4$. Our results in particular show that when $n\geq 2$ and $p\geq 4$, or $n\geq 3$ and $p=3$, $\mathbb{C}[V]^G$ does not contain a polynomial or hypersurface separating set. It was proven in arXiv:2202.05717 that the same is true if $n \geq 4$ and $p=2$. The author made a conjecture in arXiv:2211.17088 generalising the Skronowski-Weyman theorem for representations of quivers. The results of this paper prove that conjecture in two important special cases: for the quiver with one vertex and an arbitrary number, $n$, of loops, and for the quiver with two vertices and $n$ arrows between them.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The holomorphic multiplicative chaos (HMC) is a holomorphic analogue of the Gaussian multiplicative chaos. It arises naturally as the limit in large matrix size of the characteristic polynomial of Haar unitary matrices, and more generally, random matrices following the Circular-$\beta$-Ensemble. In a previous article, Najnudel, Paquette and Simm prove that in the $L^2$ phase $\beta > 4$, the appropriately normalized Fourier coefficient of the HMC converges in distribution to the square root of the total mass of the Gaussian multiplicative chaos on the unit circle, multiplied by an independent complex normal random variable. This convergence has been extended to the $L^1$ phase by Najnudel, Paquette, Simm and Vu. In the present article, we prove that this convergence further extends to the critical case $\beta = 2$, which corresponds to the limiting coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the Circular Unitary Ensemble. We also prove the joint convergence of consecutive Fourier coefficients, and we derive convergence in distribution of the secular coefficients of the Circular Unitary Ensemble with index growing sufficiently slowly with the dimension.</p></details>

These regions have a different nature from all known regions studied so far: they contain \emph{intruder sets} associated with distinct combinatorics that trespass the region where self-replication holds. Our construction follows the usual self-replication method but replaces the standard local uniqueness condition with a more flexible and weaker property. These examples emerged from a large-scale computational search for regions of $M\setminus L$, which indicates that many such regions with intruder sets exist. We conclude with some open problems about these new regions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb{N}$ be a set of the natural numbers. Symmetric inverse semigroup $R_\infty$ is the semigroup of all infinite 0-1 matrices $[g_{ij}]$ with at most one 1 in each row and each column such that $g_{ii}=1$ on the complement of a finite set. The binary operation in $R_\infty$ is the ordinary matrix multiplication. It is clear that infinite symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_\infty$ is a subgroup of $R_\infty$. The map $\star:\left[ g_{ij}\right]\mapsto\left[ g_{ji}\right]$ is an involution on $R_\infty$. We call a function $f$ on $R_\infty$ positive definite if for all $r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n\in R_\infty$ the matrix $\left[ f\left( r_ir_j^\star\right)\right]$ is Hermitian and positive semi-definite. A function $f$ said to be indecomposable if the corresponding $\ast$-representation $\pi_f$ is a factor-representation. A class of the $\mathfrak{S}_\infty$-invariant functions is defined by the condition $f(rs)=f(sr)$ for all $r\in R_\infty$ and $s\in\mathfrak{S}_\infty$. In this paper we classify all semifinite factor-representations of $R_\infty$ that correspond to the $\mathfrak{S}_\infty$-invariant positive definite functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we demonstrate that, given an orthonormal basis of holomorphic Hecke cusp forms, conditionally, quadratic forms composed of cusp forms -- each expressed as a bounded linear combination of holomorphic Hecke cusp forms -- are generally not themselves expressible as bounded linear combinations of holomorphic Hecke cusp forms when the sum of the weights exceeds some absolute constant, provided that the coefficients of the quadratic form satisfy appropriate nonvanishing and boundedness conditions. This illustrates the finiteness of the number of solutions to the linear equation of modular forms equated to a quadratic form of large weight. We also show that, conditionally, for $0 < p < 2$, the $\ell^p$-norm of such quadratic forms in holomorphic Hecke cusp forms tends to zero asymptotically with respect to expansion in this orthonormal basis of Hecke eigenforms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1967, Klarner proposed a problem concerning the existence of reflecting $n$-queens configurations. The problem considers the feasibility of placing $n$ mutually non-attacking queens on the reflecting chessboard, an $n\times n$ chessboard with a $1\times n$ "reflecting strip" of squares added along one side of the board. A queen placed on the reflecting chessboard can attack the squares in the same row, column, and diagonal, with the additional feature that its diagonal path can be reflected via the reflecting strip. Klarner noted the equivalence of this problem to a number theory problem proposed by Slater, which asks: for which $n$ is it possible to pair up the integers 1 through $n$ with the integers $n+1$ through $2n$ such that no two of the sums or differences of the $n$ pairs of integers are the same. We prove the existence of reflecting $n$-queens configurations for all sufficiently large $n$, thereby resolving both Slater's and Klarner's questions for all but a finite number of integers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a joint ordered multifactorisation for a given positive integer $n\geq 2$ into $m$ parts, where $n=n_1~\times~\ldots~\times~n_m$, and each part $n_j$ is split into one or more component factors. Our central result gives an enumeration formula for all such joint ordered multifactorisations $\mathcal{N}_m(n)$. As an illustrative application, we show how each such factorisation can be used to uniquely construct and so count the number of distinct additive set systems (historically referred to as complementing set systems). These set systems under set addition generate the first $n$ non-negative consecutive integers uniquely and, when each component set is centred about 0, exhibit algebraic invariances. For fixed integers $n$ and $m$, invariance properties for $\mathcal{N}_m(n)$ are established. The formula for $\mathcal{N}_m(n)$ is comprised of sums over associated divisor functions and the Stirling numbers of the second kind, and we conclude by deducing sum over divisor relations for our counting function $\mathcal{N}_m(n)$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Takreem Haider &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** cs.CR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a fundamental component of modern public-key cryptosystems that enable efficient and secure digital signatures, key exchanges, and encryption. Its core operation, scalar multiplication, denoted as $k \cdot P$, where $P$ is a base point and $k$ is a private scalar, relies heavily on the secrecy and unpredictability of $k$. Conventionally, $k$ is selected using user input or pseudorandom number generators. However, in resource-constrained environments with weak entropy sources, these approaches may yield low-entropy or biased scalars, increasing susceptibility to side-channel and key recovery attacks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we introduce an optimization-driven scalar generation method that explicitly maximizes bit-level entropy. Our approach uses differential evolution (DE), a population-based metaheuristic algorithm, to search for scalars whose binary representations exhibit maximal entropy, defined by an even and statistically uniform distribution of ones and zeros. This reformulation of scalar selection as an entropy-optimization problem enhances resistance to entropy-based cryptanalytic techniques and improves overall unpredictability. Experimental results demonstrate that DE-optimized scalars achieve entropy significantly higher than conventionally generated scalars. The proposed method can be integrated into existing ECC-based protocols, offering a deterministic, tunable alternative to traditional randomness, ideal for applications in blockchain, secure messaging, IoT, and other resource-constrained environments.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent papers [1,2], a new method to cross the natural boundary has been proposed, and applied to Mordell-Borel integrals arising in the study of Chern-Simons theory, based on decompositions into {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}. Resurgent analysis on the Stokes line leads to a unique transseries decomposition in terms of unary false theta functions, which can be continued across the natural boundary to produce dual $q$-series whose integer-valued coefficients enumerate BPS states. This constitutes a deeper new manifestation of resurgence in quantum field theoretic path integrals. In this paper we show that the algebraic structure of the {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}, combined with just the leading term of the $q$-series, completely determines the large order rate of growth of the dual $q$-series coefficients. The essential exponent of this asymptotic growth has a Cardy-like interpretation [10] of an effective central charge in a 3 dimensional quantum field theory with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry related to the Chern-Simons theory through the $3d$-$3d$ correspondence.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The aim of this paper is to build a theory of commutative and noncommutative {\it injective} valuations of various algebras (including algebras with zero divisors). The targets of our valuations are (well-)ordered commutative and noncommutative (partial and entire) semigroups including any sub-semigroups of the free monoid $F_n$ on $n$ generators and various quotients. When the range of a valuation of an algebra $A$ is a finitely generated (partial) semigroup, we construct a generalization of the standard monomial bases in $A$, which seems to be new in noncommutative case. Quite remarkably, for any pair of well-ordered valuations one has a canonical bijection between the valuation semigroups, which serves as an analog of the celebrated Jordan-H\"older correspondences and these bijections are ``almost" homomorphisms of the involved semigroups. A spectacular demonstration of this remarkable property of JH-bijections for quantum Schubert cells $A=U_q(w)$ results in mysterious "symplectomorphisms" of involved skew symmetric forms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given dominant integral weights $\lambda, \mu, \nu$ of a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and an element $w$ of its Weyl group, the refined tensor product multiplicity $c_{\lambda \mu}^\nu(w)$ is the multiplicity of the irreducible $\mathfrak{g}$-module $V(\nu)$ in the so-called Kostant--Kumar submodule $K(\lambda, w, \mu)$ of the tensor product $V(\lambda) \otimes V(\mu)$. We derive properties of these coefficients in general type, including a Brauer--Klimyk type formula and restriction theorems. In type $A$, we obtain a hive model for the $c_{\lambda \mu}^\nu(w)$ and prove that the saturation and strong semigroup properties hold if the permutation $w$ is $312$-avoiding, $231$-avoiding, or a commuting product of such elements.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a nonempty finite subset of an additive abelian group $G$. Given a nonnegative integer $h$, the $h$-fold sumset $hA$ is the set of all sums of $h$ elements of $A$, and the restricted $h$-fold sumset $h^\wedge A$ is the set of all sums of $h$ distinct elements of $A$. The union of restricted sumsets $s^\wedge A$, where $s=0, 1, \ldots, h$, is denoted by $[0, h]^\wedge A$. For fixed positive integers $m$ and $h$, the maximum size of the sumset $hA$ of a set $A \subseteq G$ with $m$ elements is denoted by $\nu(G, m, h)$. In other words, $\nu(G, m, h) = \max\{|hA| : A \subseteq G, |A|= m\}$. Analogous quantities can be defined for the sumsets $h^\wedge A$ and $[0, h]^\wedge A$. Optimal upper bounds are known for these quantities. If $G$ is a finite cyclic group of order $n$, then each of these quantities agrees with the optimal upper bound, except in many cases. Bajnok posed the problem of determining all positive integers $n$, $m$, and $h$ for which the value of the function $f(n, m, h)$ is strictly less than the optimal upper bound. He posed similar problems for quantities related to the sumsets $h^\wedge A$ and $[0, h]^\wedge A$. We prove that, for any positive integer $h$, there are infinitely many positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $\nu(\mathbb{Z}_n, m, h)$ is strictly less than the optimal upper bound. We also prove similar results for quantities related to the sumsets $h^\wedge A$ and $[0, h]^\wedge A$ also. These results provide the partial solutions to the problems posed by Bajnok.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A solution $(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{Z}^3-\{(0,0,0)\}$ to a generalized Fermat equation $$ Ax^a + By^b + Cz^c = 0, $$ is called \emph{primitive} if $\gcd(x,y,z) = 1$. By work of Beukers, we know that in the \emph{spherical} regime (that is, when the Euler characteristic $\chi = \tfrac{1}{a} + \tfrac{1}{b} + \tfrac{1}{c} - 1$ is positive), if the equation has one primitive solution, then it has infinitely many. In this work, we use the method of \emph{Fermat descent}, as employed by Poonen--Schaefer--Stoll, to refine Beukers' result to an asymptotic count of the number of primitive integral solutions of bounded height.</p></details>

The distributional convergence is proved by applying the martingale central limit theorem to a suitably truncated sum. This truncation is inspired by work of Najnudel, Paquette, Simm and Vu on subcritical holomorphic multiplicative chaos setting, but analysed with a different conditioning argument generalised from Harper's work on fractional moments to circumvent integrability issues at criticality. A significant part of the proof is devoted to the convergence in probability of the associated partial Euler product to a critical multiplicative chaos measure, independent of the mild shift away from the critical line. Our approach to the universality of critical non-Gaussian multiplicative chaos bypasses the barrier analysis with the help of a modified second moment method, and employs a novel argument based on coupling and homogenisation by change of measure, which could be of independent interest.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Some references added in v2

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A well-known conjecture of Gross and Zagier states that the values of the higher automorphic Green's function at pairs of points with complex multiplication in the upper half-plane are proportional to the logarithm of an algebraic number. It was recently settled in the case of congruence subgroups of the form $\Gamma_0(N)$ by analytic methods. In this paper we provide a geometric and motivic interpretation of the general conjecture, and show that it is a consequence of a standard conjecture in the theory of motives. In addition, we define a new class of matrix-valued higher Green's functions for both odd and even weight modular forms, and show that they are single-valued periods of a motive constructed from a suitable moduli stack of elliptic curves with marked points. The motive has the structure of a biextension involving symmetric powers of the motives of elliptic curves. This suggests a very general extension of the Gross-Zagier conjecture relating values of matrix-valued higher Green's functions at points which do not necessarily have complex multiplication to special values of $L$-functions. In particular, our motivic interpretation of the Gross-Zagier log-algebraicity conjecture enables us to give a completely geometric proof in level 1 and weight 4 by showing that the motive of the moduli stack $\mathcal{M}_{1,3}$ of elliptic curves with 3 marked points is mixed Tate. In the course of this paper we develop many new foundational results on: the theory of weak harmonic lifts, meromorphic modular forms, biextensions of modular motives, and their corresponding algebraic de Rham cohomology and single-valued periods, which may all be of independent interest.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $U_q$ be the quantum group corresponding to a complex simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ with root system $R$. Assume the quantum parameter $q\in \C$ is a root of unity. In this paper we study the extensions between simple modules in the category consisting of the finite dimensional modules for $U_q$. We first prove that this problem is equivalent to finding the extensions between the finitely many simple modules for the small quantum group $u_q$ in $U_q$. Then we show that the extension groups in question are determined by a finite subset with small highest weights. When the order of $q^2$ is at least the Coxeter number for $R$ we prove that the dimensions of such extension groups equal the top degree coefficients of some associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial for the affine Weyl group for $R$. We relate all this to similar (old) results for almost simple algebraic groups and their Frobenius subgroup schemes over fields of large prime characteristics.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is devoted to studying two important classes of objects in triangulated categories; silting objects and $d$-cluster tilting objects, and their correspondences. First, we introduce the notion of $d$-silting objects as a generalization tilting objects whose endomorphism algebras have global dimension at most $d$. For a smooth dg algebra $A$ and its $(d+1)$-Calabi-Yau completion $\Pi$, we show that the induction functor gives an embedding from the poset $\mathrm{silt}^dA$ of $d$-silting objects of $A$ to the poset $\mathrm{silt}\Pi$ of silting objects of $\Pi$. Moreover, when $H^0\Pi$ is finite dimensional, this functor identifies the Hasse quiver of $\mathrm{silt}^dA$ as a full subquiver of the Hasse quiver of $\mathrm{silt}\Pi$. In this case, we also prove that each $d$-silting object $P$ of $A$ gives a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of $\mathrm{per} A$ as the $\nu[-d]$-orbit of $P$. Secondly, for a connective Calabi-Yau dg algebra $\Pi$, we study the map from $\mathrm{silt}\Pi$ to the set $d\text{-}\mathrm{ctilt}\mathcal{C}(\Pi)$ of $d$-cluster tilting objects in the cluster category $\mathcal{C}(\Pi)$. We call $\Pi$ $\mathcal{F}$-liftable if the induced map $\mathrm{silt}\Pi\cap\mathcal{F}\to d\text{-}\mathrm{ctilt}\mathcal{C}(\Pi)$ is bijective, where $\mathcal{F}$ is the fundamental domain in $\mathrm{per}\Pi$. We prove that $\mathcal{F}$-liftable Calabi-Yau dg algebras $\Pi$ such that $H^0\Pi$ is hereditary are precisely the Calabi-Yau completions of hereditary algebras. As an application, we obtain counter-examples to an open question posed in [IYa1]. We also study Calabi-Yau dg algebras such that the map $\mathrm{silt}\Pi\to d\text{-}\mathrm{ctilt}\mathcal{C}(\Pi)$ is surjective, which we call liftable. We explain our results by polynomial dg algebras and Calabi-Yau completions of type $A_2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is an introduction to cluster algebras and their common triangular bases. These bases are Kazhdan-Lusztig-type and serve as the canonical bases of cluster algebras from the representation-theoretic point of view. We review seeds associated with signed words, cluster operations (freezing and base change), the extension technique from finite to infinite rank, which are convenient tools to study these algebras and their bases. We present recent results on the topic and provide examples. An appendix collects detailed examples of some cluster algebras from Lie theory, including those from Lie groups and representations of quantum affine algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any positive integers $s$ and $t$, let $Q_{t}^{s}(n)$ denotes the number of partitions of a positive integer $n$ into distinct parts such that no part is congruent to $s$ or $t-s$ modulo $t$. We prove some Ramanujan-type congruences for $Q_{t}^{s}(n)$ for some particular values of $s$ and $t$ by employing $q$-series and theta function identities.</p></details>
