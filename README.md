<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We recall and define various kinds of supersingular $\ell$-isogeny graphs and precise graph isomorphism with a corresponding quaternion $\ell$-ideal graph. In particular, we introduce the notion of double-orientations on supersingular elliptic curves and study the structure of double-oriented supersingular $\ell$-isogeny graphs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a Hecke-Maass cusp form for $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$ and $A(m,n)$ be its normalized Fourier coefficients. Let $V$ be a smooth function, compactly supported on $[1,2]$ and satisfying $V(y)^{j} \ll_j y^{-j}$ for any $j \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$. In this article we prove a power-saving upper bound for the `average' shifted convolution sum \begin{equation*} \sum_{h}\sum_{n}A(1,n)A(1,n+h)V\left(\frac{n}{N}\right)V\left(\frac{h}{H}\right), \end{equation*} for the range $N^{1/2-\varepsilon} \geq H \geq N^{1/6+ \varepsilon}$, for any $\varepsilon >0$. This is an improvement over the previously known range $N^{1/2-\varepsilon} \geq H \geq N^{1/4+ \varepsilon}$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Natalia Hormazábal, Carlos Martínez-Ranero &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a quadratic imaginary extension of $\mathbb{Q}$, let $S$ be a finite nonempty set of non archimedean places, and let $\mathcal{O}_{K,S}$ denote the ring of $S$-integers of $K$. We show that there is no algorithm which solves the following problem. Given an arbitrary system of linear equations over the integers together with divisibility conditions on some of the variables, decide whether or not there exists a solution over $\mathcal{O}_{K,S}$. This contrasts with Lipshitz's result, which shows that such algorithm does exists for the ring of integers (i.e. $S=\emptyset).$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Suppose $k$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic two, let $A_4$ be an alternating group on four letters, and let $H$ be the unique Sylow two-subgroup of $A_4$. Let $X$ be a smooth projective irreducible curve over $k$ with a faithful $A_4$-action such that the quotient curve $X/H$ is a projective line and the $H$-cover $X\to X/H$ is totally ramified, in the sense that it is ramified and every branch point is totally ramified. Under these assumptions, we determine the precise $kA_4$-module structure of the space of holomorphic differentials of $X$ over $k$. We show that there are infinitely many different isomorphism classes of indecomposable $kA_4$-modules that can occur as direct summands, and we give precise formulas for the multiplicities with which they occur.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Mollifiers are used in a variety of contexts, for instance to study the non-vanishing of $L$-functions. In this paper, we study the general question of finding optimal mollifiers and provide criteria to identify them provided the corresponding mollified moments can be computed. As an application, we study the non-vanishing of central values of Dirichlet $L$-functions. In particular we show that the Michel-Vanderkam mollifier is optimal in a wide class of balanced two-piece mollifiers as well as provide a new proof that the Iwaniec-Sarnak mollifier is optimal in a wide class of one-piece mollifiers.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jeremy Peters &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 50 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we will be studying the parameter space for the quantum multiplication for hypertoric varieties. The operation of quantum multiplication for hypertoric varieties has an explicit formulation which is given by McBreen and Shenfeld. In particular, this multiplication depends on a parameter which lives in the complement of a toric arrangement. Following a paper of deConcini and Gaiffi, I will define a compactification of this parameter space and show how the quantum multiplication can be extended to this compactification.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages, comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A ternary Nambu-Poisson algebra (which we call a Nambu-Poisson algebra in the paper) is the underlying algebraic structure of Nambu-Poisson manifolds of order $3$ that appeared in the generalized Hamiltonian mechanics. First, we consider the 2nd cohomology group of a Nambu-Poisson algebra with coefficients in a given representation. Next, we discuss suitable linear deformations of a Nambu-Poisson algebra and show that any such trivial deformation yields a Nijenhuis operator on it. To understand the deformed Nambu-Poisson algebra obtained from a Nijenhuis operator, we introduce a new algebraic structure, which we name NS-Nambu-Poisson algebras. Finally, we consider $\mathcal{O}$-operators twisted by $2$-cocycles and find their close relationships with NS-Nambu-Poisson algebras.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages; some clarifications in Section 2.7; other minor improvements; v4: final bibliography update

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The inverse Galois problem asks whether any finite group can be realised as the Galois group of a Galois extension of the rationals. This problem and its refinements have stimulated a large amount of research in number theory and algebraic geometry in the past century, ranging from Noether's problem (letting X denote the quotient of the affine space by a finite group acting linearly, when is X rational?) to the rigidity method (if X is not rational, does it at least contain interesting rational curves?) and to the arithmetic of unirational varieties (if all else fails, does X at least contain interesting rational points?). The goal of the present notes, which formed the basis for three lectures given at the Park City Mathematics Institute in August 2022, is to provide an introduction to these topics.</p></details>

Outside characteristics 2 and 3, at most 10 exceptional curves can intersect in a point. We classify the different ways in which 10 exceptional curves can intersect, construct a new family of surfaces with 10 exceptional curves intersecting in a point, and discuss strategies for finding more such examples.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The objective of this paper is to show (a)=(b)=(c) as rational functions of $T$, $U$ for (a), (b), (c) given by (a) continued fractions of length $2^{n+1}-1$ with explicit partial denominators in $\left\{-T,U^{-1}T\right\}$, (b) truncated series $\sum_{0\le m\le n} \left(U^{2^m}/\left(h_0(T)h_1(T,U) \cdots h_m(T,U)\right)\right)$ with $h_n$ defined by $h_0:=T$ and $h_{n+1}(T,U):=h_n(T,U)^2-2U^{2^n} (n \geq 0)$, (c) $(n+1)$-fold iteration $F^{(n+1)}(0)= F^{(n+1)}(0,T,U)$ of $F(X)= F(X,T,U) :=X-f(X)/\frac{df}{dX}(X)$ for $f(X)=X^2-T X+U$, and to find explicit equalities among truncated Hurwitz continued fraction expansion of relatively quadratic units $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$ over imaginary quadratic fields $\mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{-1}\right)$, $\mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{-3}\right)$, rapidly convergent complex series called the Sierpinski series, and the Newton approximation of $\alpha$ on the complex plane. We also give an estimate of the error of the Newton approximation of the unit $\alpha$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yeor Hafouta &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.PR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** I added a disucssion in Remark 2.7 that emphasizes that using the Burkholder inequality is more effective that the classical hypercontractive inequalities for moments or larger than logarothmic order in the number of summands n

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X_p, p\in\cP$ be a sequence of independent random variables s.t. $\bbP(X_p=\pm 1)=1/2$. Let $\te_j=\prod_{p|j}X_p$ if $j$ is square free and $\te_j=0$ otherwise. Denote $S_n=\sum_{\ell=1}^n\te_\ell$. The from this point of view proving limit theorems for $S_n$ is natural problem, since $S_n$ mimics the behavior of $e^{\sqrt{\ln(\beta)}}$. It is a natural guiding conjecture that $S_n/\sqrt n$ obeys the central limit theorem (CLT). However, S. Chatterjee conjectured (as expressed in \cite{[25]}) that the CLT should not hold. Chatterjee's conjecture was proved by Harper \cite{[17]}, and by now it is a direct consequence of a more recent breakthrough by Harper \cite{Har20} that $\frac{S_n}{b_n}\to 0$ in $L^1$, where $b_n=(n^{1/2}(\ln(\ln(n)))^{-1/4})u_n, u_n\to\infty$. In particular $S_n/\sqrt n\to 0$. Nevertheless, the question whether there exists a sequence $a_n=o(b_n)$ such that $S_n/a_n$ converges to some limit remains a mystery. Note that the corresponding problem in the Steinhaus Setting was recently resolved by \cite{Gor1}. In this paper make an attempt to shed some light on the convergence of $S_n/a_n$. Additionally, we obtain explicit estimates on hight moments of $S_n$ without restrictions on the size of the moment compared to $n$ like in \cite[Theorem 1.2]{Har19}, which is of independent interest. This is achieved by a martingale argument together with the Burkholder inequality, and it has applications in a natural number theoretic combinatorial problem. Using martingale techniques we will also obtain exponential concentration inequalities for $S_n$ (in the large deviations regime)</p></details>

> **Comment:** Work is done during ANU-FRT program 2025

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct an action of the braid group on the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on hypertoric varieties arising from hyperplane arrangements. Using wall-crossing equivalences associated to paths in the complexified complement of the hyperplane arrangement, we show that these equivalences yield a functor from the Deligne groupoid to the category of triangulated equivalences. This gives rise to a canonical representation of the fundamental group, which under suitable assumptions recovers the braid group, acting on $D^b(\mathfrak{M}_{\eta})$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yusuke Ohkubo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 30 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is known that the $q$-deformed Virasoro algebra can be constructed from a certain representation of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_1$ algebra. In this paper, we apply the same construction to the quantum toroidal algebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ and study the properties of resulting generators $W_i(z)$ ($i=1,2$). The algebra generated by $W_i(z)$ can be regarded as a $q$-deformation of the direct sum $\mathsf{F} \oplus \mathsf{SVir}$, where $\mathsf{F}$ denotes the free fermion algebra and $\mathsf{SVir}$ stands for the $N=1$ super Virasoro algebra, also referred to as the $N=1$ superconformal algebra or the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond algebra. Moreover, the generators $W_i(z)$ admit two screening currents, and we show that their degeneration limits coincide with the screening currents of $\mathsf{SVir}$. We also establish quadratic relations satisfied by $W_i(z)$ and show that they generate a pair of commuting $q$-deformed Virasoro algebras, which degenerate into two nontrivial commuting Virasoro algebras included in $\mathsf{F} \oplus \mathsf{SVir}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given an infinite set $\Omega$ and a ring $R$ as well as a group $G$ acting on them, we show that $G$ and a subgroup $H$ share the same canonical relational structure on $\Omega$ if and only if the restriction functor gives an equivalence from the category of discrete representations of $G$ to that of $H$. Moreover, the age of this relational structure satisfies the strong amalgamation property if and only if there is a canonical isomorphism from the category of finite substructures of $\Omega$ and embeddings to the opposite category of the orbit category of $G$. As an application, we prove that finitely generated discrete representations of highly homogeneous groups over the polynomial ring $k[\Omega]$ are Noetherian.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 39 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Define $||n||$ to be the complexity of $n$, the smallest number of ones needed to write $n$ using an arbitrary combination of addition and multiplication. The set $\mathscr{D}$ of defects, differences $\delta(n):=||n||-3\log_3 n$, is known to be a well-ordered subset of $[0,\infty)$, with order type $\omega^\omega$. This is proved by showing that, for any $r$, there is a finite set $\mathcal{S}_s$ of certain multilinear polynomials, called low-defect polynomials, such that $\delta(n)\le s$ if and only if one can write $n = f(3^{k_1},\ldots,3^{k_r})3^{k_{r+1}}$. In this paper we show that, in addition to it being true that $\mathscr{D}$ (and thus $\overline{\mathscr{D}}$) has order type $\omega^\omega$, this set satisifies a sort of self-similarity property with $\overline{\mathscr{D}}' = \overline{\mathscr{D}} + 1$. This is proven by restricting attention to substantial low-defect polynomials, ones that can be themselves written efficiently in a certain sense, and showing that in a certain sense the values of these polynomials at powers of $3$ have complexity equal to the na\"ive upper bound most of the time. As a result, we also prove that, under appropriate conditions on $a$ and $b$, numbers of the form $b(a3^k+1)3^\ell$ will, for all sufficiently large $k$, have complexity equal to the na\"ive upper bound. These results resolve various earlier conjectures of the second author.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 13 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For coprime nonzero integers $a$ and $b$, a positive integer $\ell$ is said to be {\em good} with respect to $a$ and $b$ if there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $\ell |(a^{k}+b^{k})$. Since the early 1990s, such classical good integers have been studied intensively for their number theoretic structures and for applications, notably in coding theory. This work completes the study by relaxing the coprimality hypothesis and treating the non-coprime case $\gcd(a,b)\neq1$ in a concise and self-contained way. The results are presented in terms of the classical coprime criterion and $p$-adic valuations of $\ell$. As a consequence, whenever $\ell$ is good, all admissible exponents form a single arithmetic progression with an explicit starting point and period. Some special cases are discussed in the non-coprime setting. A practical decision procedure is developed that decides the goodness of a given integer and explicitly enumerates the full set of admissible exponents. Several illustrative examples are presented.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Prime Number Theorem states that the number of primes in $\{1,\ldots,x\}$, denoted $\pi(x)$, is approximately $\frac{x}{\ln(x)}$. In this paper, we investigate the distribution of primes for domains other than $\N$. First we look at $A_d=\{ x \colon x\equiv 1 \pmod d\}$. We give a heuristic argument to form a conjecture on the number of {\it congruence monoid primes} in $A_d$ that are $\le x$. We then provide empirical evidence that indicates our conjecture is close but may need some correction. Second, we do similar calculations for the Gaussian Integers. Third, we discuss the difficulty of these types of questions for quadratic extensions of ${\sf Z}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field with $\mathrm{char}(K)\neq 2$, and $A$ a skewed-gentle $K$-algebra. In this case, Crawley-Boevey's description of the indecomposable $A$-modules becomes particularly easy. This allows us to provide an explicit basis for the homomorphisms between any two indecomposable representations in terms of the corresponding admissible words in the sense of Qiu and Zhou. Previously (Geiss, 1999), such a basis was only available when no asymmetric band modules were involved. We also extend a relaxed version of fringing and kisses from Br\"ustle et al. (2020) to the setting of skewed-gentle algebras. With this at hand, we obtain convenient formulae for the E-invariant and g-vector for indecomposable $A$-modules, similar to the known expressions for gentle algebras. Note however, that we allow in our context also band-modules. As an application, we describe the indecomposable, generically $\tau$-regular irreducible components of the representation varieties of $A$ as well as the generic values of the E-invariant between them in terms of tagged admissible words.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Parahoric Lusztig induction gives a broad class of virtual smooth representations of parahoric subgroups in a $p$-adic group, serving as a natural generalization of classical Lusztig induction to the $p$-adic setting. This construction has important applications in the representation theory of p-adic groups. In this paper, we prove the Mackey formula for parahoric Lusztig induction in generic case, which generalizes a classic result of Lusztig in 1976. As an application, we describe the irreducible decomposition of paragoric Deligne-Lusztig representations for the case of elliptic torus.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define and initiate the study of analytic de Rham stacks of relative Fargues-Fontaine curves. To this end, we develop a theory of analytic de Rham stacks with sufficiently strong descent and approximation properties. Specializing to the de Rham stack of the Fargues-Fontaine curve attached to $\mathbb{C}_p$, we apply the general theory to obtain a new geometric proof of the $p$-adic monodromy theorem, avoiding any reliance on earlier results on $p$-adic differential equations. Building on the foundations established here, we plan in a sequel to investigate the cohomology of de Rham stacks of relative Fargues-Fontaine curves in geometric situations and, in particular, provide a stack-theoretic definition of Hyodo-Kato cohomology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates the algebraic and graphical structure of the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{sp}$, with a focus on its decomposition into finite fields, kernels, and special subsets. We establish classical isomorphisms between $\mathbb{F}_s$ and $p\mathbb{F}_s$, as well as $p\mathbb{F}_s^{\star}$ and $p\mathbb{F}_s^{+1,\star}$. We introduce the notion of arcs and rooted trees to describe the pre-periodic structure of $\mathbb{Z}_{sp}$, and prove that trees rooted at elements not divisible by $s$ or $p$ can be generated from the tree of unity via multiplication by cyclic arcs. Furthermore, we define and analyze the set $\mathbb{D}_{sp}$, consisting of elements that are neither multiples of $s$ or $p$ nor "off-by-one" elements, and show that its graph decomposes into cycles and pre-periodic trees. Finally, we demonstrate that every cycle in $\mathbb{Z}_{sp}$ contains inner cycles that are derived predictably from the cycles of the finite fields $p\mathbb{F}_s$ and $s\mathbb{F}_p$, and we discuss the cryptographic relevance of $\mathbb{D}_{sp}$, highlighting its potential for analyzing cyclic attacks and factorization methods.</p></details>

When $m$ is a positive even integer, these integrals have been evaluated previously by Sofo and Bat{\i}r, and the case where $m$ is an odd integer has been left as open problems. The integrals of the first kind arise in Zagier's work on the Kronecker limit formula.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Kleshchev and Livesey proved the existence of RoCK $p$-blocks for double covers of symmetric and alternating groups over large enough coefficient rings. They proved that RoCK blocks of double covers are Morita equivalent to standard ``local" blocks via bimodules with endopermutation source. Based on this, Kleshchev and Livesey proved that these RoCK blocks are splendidly Rickard equivalent to their Brauer correspondents. The analogous result for blocks of symmetric groups, a theorem of Chuang and Kessar, was an important step in Chuang and Rouquier ultimately proving Brou\'e's abelian defect group conjecture for symmetric groups. In this paper we show that in most cases the Morita and splendid Rickard equivalences constructed by Kleshchev and Livesey descend to the ring $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p$-adic integers, hence prove Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'e's abelian defect group conjecture for most of these RoCK blocks.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given any vertex operator algebra $ V $ with an automorphism $ g $, we derive a Jacobi identity for an intertwining operator $ \mathcal{Y} $ of type $ \left( \begin{smallmatrix} W_3\\ W_1 \, W_2 \end{smallmatrix}\right) $ when $ W_1 $ is an untwisted $ V $-module, and $ W_2 $ and $ W_3 $ are $ g $-twisted $ V $-modules. We say such an intertwining operator is of $\left(\!\begin{smallmatrix} g\\ 1 \ g \end{smallmatrix}\!\right)$-type. Using the Jacobi identity, we obtain homogeneous linear differential equations satisfied by the multi-series $ \langle w_0, \mathcal{Y}_1(w_1,z_1) \cdots \mathcal{Y}_N(w_N,z_N) w_{N+1} \rangle $ when $ \mathcal{Y}_j $ are of $\left(\!\begin{smallmatrix} g\\ 1 \ g \end{smallmatrix}\!\right)$-type and the modules are $ C_1 $-cofinite and discretely graded. In the special case that $ V $ is an affine vertex operator algebra, we derive the ``twisted KZ equations" and show that its solutions have regular singularities at certain prescribed points when $ g $ has finite order. When $ V $ is general and $ g $ has finite order, we use the theory of regular singular points to prove that the multi-series $ \langle w_0, \mathcal{Y}_1(w_1,z_1) \cdots \mathcal{Y}_N(w_N,z_N) w_{N+1} \rangle $ converges absolutely to a multivalued analytic function when $ |z_1| > \cdots > |z_N| > 0 $ and analytically extends to the region $ z_i, z_i - z_j \neq 0 $. Furthermore, when $ N = 2 $, we show that these multivalued functions have regular singularities at certain prescribed points.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate compatibility of gradings for an almost Koszul or Koszul algebra $R$ that is also the higher preprojective algebra $\Pi_{n+1}(A)$ of an $n$-hereditary algebra $A$. For an $n$-representation finite algebra $A$, we show that $A$ must be Koszul if $\Pi_{n+1}(A)$ can be endowed with an almost Koszul grading. For an acyclic basic $n$-representation infinite algebra $A$, we show that $A$ must be Koszul if $\Pi_{n+1}(A)$ can be endowed with a Koszul grading. From this we deduce that a higher preprojective grading of an (almost) Koszul algebra $R = \Pi_{n+1}(A)$ is, in both cases, isomorphic to a cut of the (almost) Koszul grading. Up to a further assumption on the tops of the degree $0$ subalgebras for the different gradings, we also show a similar result without the basic assumption in the $n$-representation infinite case. As an application, we show that $n$-APR tilting preserves the property of being Koszul for $n$-representation infinite algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a connected reductive group $G$ over a local or global field $K$, we define a *diamond* (or *power*) operation $$(\xi,n)\mapsto \xi^{\Diamond n}\,\colon\, H^1(K,G)\times {\mathbb Z}\to H^1(K,G)$$ of raising to power $n$ in the Galois cohomology pointed set (this operation is new when $K$ is a number field). We show that this power operation has many good properties. When $G$ is a torus, the set $H^1(K,G)$ has a natural group structure, and $\xi^{\Diamond n}$ then coincides with the $n$-th power of $\xi$ in this group. On the other hand, we show that a power operation on $H^1(K,G)$, functorial in $G$, which we define over local and global fields, cannot be defined for an arbitrary field $K$. Our proof of this assertion relies on the results of Appendix B written by Philippe Gille. Using this power operation, for a cohomology class $\xi$ in $H^1(K,G)$ over local or global field, we define the period ${\rm per}(\xi)$ to be the least integer $n\ge 1$ such that $\xi^{\Diamond n}=1$. We define the index ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of the degrees $[L:K]$ of finite extensions $L/K$ splitting $\xi$. The period and index of a cohomology class generalize the period and index a central simple algebra over $K$. For any connected reductive group $G$ defined over a local or global field $K$, we show that ${\rm per}(\xi)$ divides ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ and that ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ may be strictly greater than ${\rm per}(\xi)$, but they always have the same prime factors.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Faltings proved that there are finitely many abelian varieties of genus $g$ over a number field $K$, with good reduction outside a finite set of primes $S$. Fixing one of these abelian varieties $A$, we prove that there are finitely many smooth hypersurfaces in $A$, with good reduction outside $S$, representing a given ample class in the N\'eron-Severi group of $A$, up to translation, as long as the dimension of $A$ is at least $4$. Our approach builds on the approach of arXiv:1807.02721 which studies $p$-adic variations of Hodge structure to turn finiteness results for $p$-adic Galois representations into geometric finiteness statements. A key new ingredient is an approach to proving big monodromy for the variations of Hodge structure arising from the middle cohomology of these hypersurfaces using the Tannakian theory of sheaf convolution on abelian varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A character table $X$ for a saturated fusion system $\mathcal{F}$ on a finite $p$-group $S$ is the square matrix of values associated to a basis of virtual $\mathcal{F}$-stable ordinary characters of $S$. We investigate a conjecture of the second author which equates the $p$-part of $|$det$(X)|^2$ with the product of the orders of $S$-centralisers of fully $\mathcal{F}$-centralised $\mathcal{F}$-class representatives. This statement is exactly column orthogonality for the character table of $S$ when $\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{F}_S(S)$. We prove the conjecture when $\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{F}_S(G)$ is realised by some finite group $G$ with Sylow $p$-subgroup $S$, and for all simple fusion systems when $|S| \le p^4$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A 2009 article of Allcock and Vaaler explored the $\mathbb Q$-vector space $\mathcal G := \overline{\mathbb Q}^\times/{\overline{\mathbb Q}^\times_{\mathrm{tors}}}$, showing how to represent it as part of a function space on the places of $\overline{\mathbb Q}$. We establish a representation theorem for the $\mathbb R$-vector space of $\mathbb Q$-linear maps from $\mathcal G$ to $\mathbb R$, enabling us to classify extensions to $\mathcal G$ of completely additive arithmetic functions. We further outline a strategy to construct $\mathbb Q$-linear maps from $\mathcal G$ to $\mathbb Q$, i.e., elements of the algebraic dual of $\mathcal G$. Our results make heavy use of Dirichlet's $S$-unit Theorem as well as a measure-like object called a consistent map, first introduced by the author in previous work.</p></details>

> **Comment:** added new results on uniform bounds over semi-global fields

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a $(0,p)$-mixed characteristic complete discrete valued field $\mathcal{K}$ we define a class of finite field extensions called \emph{pseudo-perfect} extensions such that the natural restriction map on the mod-$p$ Milnor $K$-groups is trivial for all $p\neq 2$. This implies that pseudo-perfect extensions split every element in $H^i(\mathcal{K},\mu_p^{\otimes i-1})$ yielding period-index bounds for Brauer classes as well as higher cohomology classes of $\mathcal{K}$. As a corollary, we prove a conjecture of Bhaskhar-Haase that the Brauer $p$-dimension of $\mathcal{K}$ is upper bounded by $n+1$ where $n$ is the $p$-rank of the residue field. When $\mathcal{K}$ is the fraction field of a complete regular ring, we show that any $p$-torsion element in $Br(\mathcal{K})$ that is nicely ramified is split by a pseudo-perfect extension yielding a bound on its index. We then use patching techniques of Harbater, Hartmann and Krashen to show that the Brauer $p$-dimension of semi-global fields of residual characteristic $p$ is at most $n+2$ and also give uniform $p$-bounds for higher cohomologies. These bounds are sharper than previously known in the work of Parimala-Suresh</p></details>

An extension $L'/K$ is said to be $\textit{parallel to $L/K$}$ if $L'$ is an intermediate field of $\widetilde{L}/K$ with $[L':K]=[L:K]$. We study the following question -- Given that $L/K$ admits a Hopf--Galois structure of type $N$, does it imply that every extension parallel to $L/K$ also admits a Hopf--Galois structure of type $N$? We completely solve this problem when the degree $[L:K]$ is a prime power and the type $N$ is cyclic. Our approach is group-theoretic and uses the work of Greither--Pareigis and Byott.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study rational iterated preimages of the origin under unicritical maps $f_{d,c}(x)=x^d+c$. Earlier works of Faber--Hutz--Stoll and Hutz--Hyde--Krause established finiteness and conditional bounds in the quadratic case. Building on this, we prove that for $d=2$ and $c \in \mathbb Q\setminus\{0,-1\}$ there are no rational fourth preimages of the origin, and for all $d \geq 3$ there are no rational second preimages outside trivial cases. The proof relies on geometric analysis of preimage curves, the elliptic Chabauty method, and Diophantine reduction. As a result, we determine the number of rational iterated preimages of $0$ under $f_{d,c}$ for all $d\geq 2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study representations of finite groups on Stanley--Reisner rings of simplicial complexes and on lattice points in lattice polytopes. The framework of translative group actions allows us to use the theory of proper colorings of simplicial complexes without requiring an explicit coloring to be given. We prove that the equivariant Hilbert series of a Cohen--Macaulay simplicial complex under a translative group action admits a rational expression whose numerator is a positive integer combination of irreducible characters. This implies an analogous rational expression for the equivariant Ehrhart series of a lattice polytope with a unimodular triangulation that is invariant under a translative group action. As an application, we study the equivariant Ehrhart series of alcoved polytopes in the sense of Lam and Postnikov and derive explicit results in the case of order polytopes and of Lipschitz poset polytopes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be an abelian variety defined over a global function field $F$, and let $p$ be a prime distinct from the characteristic of $F$. Let $F_\infty$ be a $p$-adic Lie extension of $F$ that contains the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension $F^{\mathrm{cyc}}$ of $F$. In this paper, we investigate the structure of the $p$-primary Selmer group $\mathrm{Sel}(A/F_\infty)$ of $A$ over $F_\infty$. We prove the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-conjecture for $A/F_\infty$. Furthermore, we show that both the $\mu$-invariant of the Pontryagin dual of the Selmer group $\mathrm{Sel}(A/F^\mathrm{cyc})$ and the generalised $\mu$-invariant of the Pontryagin dual of the Selmer group $\mathrm{Sel}(A/F_\infty)$ are zero, therby proving Mazur's conjecture for $A/F$. We then relate the order of vanishing of the characteristic elements, evaluated at Artin representations, to the corank of the Selmer group of the corresponding twist of $A$ over the base field $F$. Assuming the finiteness of the Tate-Shafarevich group, we establish that this corank equals the order of vanishing of the $L$-function of $A/F$ at $s=1$. Finally, we extend a theorem of Sechi - originally proved for elliptic curves without complex multiplication - to abelian varieties over global function fields. This is achieved by adapting the notion of generalised Euler characteristic, introduced by Zerbes for elliptic curves over number fields. This new invariant allows us, via Akashi series, to relate the generalised Euler characteristic of $\mathrm{Sel}(A/F_\infty)$ to the Euler characteristic of $\mathrm{Sel}(A/F^{\mathrm{cyc}})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A function from $\Bbb F_{2^n}$ to $\Bbb F_{2^n}$ is said to be {\em $k$th order sum-free} if the sum of its values over each $k$-dimensional $\Bbb F_2$-affine subspace of $\Bbb F_{2^n}$ is nonzero. This notion was recently introduced by C. Carlet as, among other things, a generalization of APN functions. At the center of this new topic is a conjecture about the sum-freedom of the multiplicative inverse function $f_{\text{\rm inv}}(x)=x^{-1}$ (with $0^{-1}$ defined to be $0$). It is known that $f_{\text{\rm inv}}$ is 2nd order (equivalently, $(n-2)$th order) sum-free if and only if $n$ is odd, and it is conjectured that for $3\le k\le n-3$, $f_{\text{\rm inv}}$ is never $k$th order sum-free. The conjecture has been confirmed for even $n$ but remains open for odd $n$. In the present paper, we show that the conjecture holds under each of the following conditions: (1) $n=13$; (2) $3\mid n$; (3) $5\mid n$; (4) the smallest prime divisor $l$ of $n$ satisfies $(l-1)(l+2)\le (n+1)/2$. We also determine the ``right'' $q$-ary generalization of the binary multiplicative inverse function $f_{\text{\rm inv}}$ in the context of sum-freedom. This $q$-ary generalization not only maintains most results for its binary version, but also exhibits some extraordinary phenomena that are not observed in the binary case.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 33 pages; included more motivating exposition for the choice of weights

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Katz and Sarnak conjectured that the behavior of zeros near the central point of any family of $L$-functions is well-modeled by the behavior of eigenvalues near $1$ of some classical compact group (either the symplectic, unitary, or even, odd, or full orthogonal group). In 2018, Knightly and Reno proved that the symmetry group can vary depending on how the $L$-functions in the family are weighted. They observed both orthogonal and symplectic symmetry in the one-level densities of families of cuspidal newform $L$-functions for different choices of weights. We observe the same dependence of symmetry on weights in the $n^{\text{th}}$ centered moments of these one-level densities, for smooth test functions whose Fourier transforms are supported in $\left(-\frac{1}{2n}, \frac{1}{2n}\right)$. To treat the new terms that emerge in our $n$-level calculations when $n>1$, i.e., the cross terms that emerge from $n$-fold products of primes rather than individual primes, we generalize Knightly and Reno's weighted trace formula from primes to arbitrary positive integers. We then perform a delicate analysis of these cross terms to distinguish their contributions to the main and error terms of the $n^{\text{th}}$ centered moments. The final novelty here is an elementary combinatorial trick that we use to rewrite the main number theoretic terms arising from our analysis, facilitating comparisons with random matrix theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this short paper, we aim at giving a more conceptual and simpler proof of Rumely's moduli theoretic characterization of type II minimal locus of the resultant function $\mathrm{ordRes}_\phi$ on the Berkovich hyperbolic space for a rational function $\phi$ on $\mathbb{P}^1$ defined over an algebraically closed and complete field that is equipped with a non-trivial and non-archimedean absolute value, and also aim at giving a much simpler and more natural proof of a degenerating limit theorem, in an improved form after DeMarco--Faber, for the family of the unique maximal entropy measures on $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$ associated to a meromorphic family of complex rational functions. We introduce the intrinsic reduction of a non-archimedean rational function $\phi$ at each point in the Berkovich projective line and its directionwise intrinsic depths, which are suitable notions for the above aims and defined in terms of the tree and analytic structures of the Berkovich projective line. Then we establish two theorems in non-archimedean dynamics, both of which play key roles in the above aims.</p></details>

The new version extends the previous work by proving many of the earlier conjectures and presenting several new results. Therefore, the earlier version has been withdrawn and replaced with this updated one

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show the denominator formulas for the normalized $R$-matrix involving two arbitrary Kirillov--Reshetikhin (KR) modules $W^{(k)}_{m,a}$ and $W^{(l)}_{p,b}$ in all nonexceptional affine types, $D_4^{(3)}$, and $G_2^{(1)}$. To achieve our goal, we prove the existence of homomorphisms, which can be understood as generalization of Dorey rule to KR modules. We also conjecture a uniform denominator formulas for all simply-laced types; in particular, type $E_n^{(1)}$. With the denominator formulas, we determine the simplicity of tensor product of KR modules and degrees of poles of normalized $R$-matrices between two KR modules completely in nonexceptional affine types, $D_4^{(3)}$, and $G_2^{(1)}$. As an application, we prove that the certain sets of KR modules for the untwisted affine types, suggested by Hernandez and Leclerc as clusters, form strongly commuting families, which implies that all cluster monomials in the clusters are real simple modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a two-step nilpotent Lie group, identified via the exponential map with the Lie-algebra $\mathfrak g=\mathfrak g_1\oplus\mathfrak g_2$, where $[\mathfrak g,\mathfrak g]\subset \mathfrak g_2$. We consider maximal functions associated to spheres in a $d$-dimensional linear subspace $H$, dilated by the automorphic dilations. $L^p$ boundedness results for the case where $H=\mathfrak g_1$ are well understood. Here we consider the case of a tilted hyperplane $H\neq \mathfrak g_1$ which is not invariant under the automorphic dilations. In the case of M\'etivier groups it is known that the $L^p$-boundedness results are stable under a small linear tilt. We show that this is generally not the case for other two-step groups, and provide new necessary conditions for $L^p$ boundedness. We prove these results in a more general setting with tilted versions of submanifolds of $\mathfrak g_1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For each positive integer $n$, we denote by $\omega^*(n)$ the number of shifted-prime divisors $p-1$ of $n$, i.e., $$\omega^*(n):=\sum_{p-1\mid n}1.$$ First introduced by Prachar in 1955, this function has interesting applications in primality testing and bears a strong connection with counting Carmichael numbers. Prachar showed that for a certain constant $c_0 > 0$, $$\omega^*(n)>\exp\left(c_0\frac{\log n}{(\log\log n)^2}\right)$$ for infinitely many $n$. This result was later improved by Adleman, Pomerance and Rumely, who established an inequality of the same shape with $(\log\log n)^2$ replaced by $\log\log n$. Assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for Dirichlet $L$-functions, Prachar also proved the stronger inequality $$\omega^*(n)>\exp\left(\left(\frac{1}{2}\log2+o(1)\right)\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\right)$$ for infinitely many $n$. By refining the arguments of Prachar and of Adleman, Pomerance and Rumely, we improve on their results by establishing \begin{align*} \omega^*(n)&>\exp\left(0.6736\log 2\cdot\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\right) \quad\text{(unconditionally)},\\ \omega^*(n)&>\exp\left(\left(\log\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)+o(1)\right)\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\right) \quad\text{(under GRH)}, \end{align*} for infinitely many $n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The representation theory of tensor functions is a powerful mathematical tool for constitutive modeling of anisotropic materials. A major limitation of the traditional theory is that many point groups require fourth- or sixth-order structural tensors, which significantly impedes practical engineering applications. Recent advances have introduced a reformulated representation theory that enables the modeling of anisotropic materials using only lower-order structural tensors (i.e., second-order or lower). Building upon the reformulated theory, this work establishes the representations of tensor functions for three-dimensional centrosymmetric point groups. For each point group, we propose a lower-order structural tensor set and derive the representations of tensor functions explicitly. For scalar-valued and second-order symmetric tensor-valued functions, our theory is indeed applicable to all three-dimensional point groups because their representations are determined by the corresponding centrosymmetric groups. The representation theory presented here is broadly applicable for constitutive modeling of anisotropic materials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The theory of locally analytic representations of $p$-adic Lie groups with $\mathbf{Q}_p$-coefficients is a powerful tool in $p$-adic Hodge theory and in the $p$-adic Langlands program. This perspective reveals important differential structures, such as the Sen and Casimir operators. Rodr\'iguez Camargo and Rodrigues Jacinto developed in \cite{RJRC22} a solid version of this theory using the language of condensed mathematics. This provides more robust homological tools (comparison theorems, spectral sequences...) for studying these representations. In this article, we extend the solid theory of locally analytic representations to a much broader class of mixed characteristic coefficients, such as $\mathbf{F}_p((X))$ or $\mathbf{Z}_p[[X]]\langle p/X\rangle[1/X]$, as well as to semilinear representations. In the introduction, we explain how these ideas could relate to mixed characteristic phenomena in $p$-adic Hodge theory, extend eigenvarieties, and the Langlands program.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A $C^1$ prime indicator $\mathcal{P}\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is constructed by applying the Fej\'er identity to the sine-quotient encoder of trial division. For integers $n\ge 2$, $\mathcal P(n)=0$ holds exactly for odd primes; $\mathcal P(2)>0$. For all non-integers $x>1$ one has $\mathcal P(x)>0$. The function is piecewise $C^\infty$ and its second derivative has jumps precisely at the squares $m^2$, with explicit sizes. Replacing the sharp cut-off by a smooth transition yields $C^\infty$ analogues $\mathcal{P}_\tau$ and $\mathcal{P}_\sigma$ with integer limits $\mathcal{P}_\tau(n;\kappa)\to \tau(n)-2$ and $\mathcal{P}_\sigma(n;\kappa)\to \sigma(n)-n-1$ as $\kappa\to\infty$, obtained from locally uniform convergence of derivative series. For large $\kappa$, numerical evidence indicates companion zeros near odd primes for $\mathcal{P}_\tau$ and an asymmetric pair for $\mathcal{P}_\sigma$. No assertion is made beyond integer input, and no statements are claimed about the prime number theorem or zero distributions of $L$-functions. The appendix includes two illustrative prime-counting sums.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Incorporating symmetries into the numerical solution of differential equations has been a mainstay of research over the last 40 years, however, one aspect is less known and under-utilised: discretisations of partial differential equations that commute with symmetry actions (like rotations, reflections or permutations) can be decoupled into independent systems solvable in parallel by incorporating knowledge from representation theory. We introduce this beautiful subject via a crash course in representation theory focussed on hands-on examples for the symmetry groups of the square and cube, and its utilisation in the construction of so-called symmetry-adapted bases. Schur's lemma, which is not well-known in applied mathematics, plays a powerful role in proving sparsity of resulting discretisations and thereby showing that partial differential equations do indeed decouple. Using Schr\"odinger equations as a motivating example, we demonstrate that a symmetry-adapted basis leads to a significant increase in the number of independent linear systems. Counterintuitively, the effectiveness of this approach is in fact greater for partial differential equations with less symmetries, for example a Schr\"odinger equation where the potential is only invariant under permutations, but not under rotations or reflections. We also explore this phenomenon as the dimension of the partial differential equation becomes large, hinting at the potential for significant savings in high-dimensions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Webs are a kind of planar, directed, edge-labeled graph that encode invariant vectors for quantum representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$. The theory of webs developed organically for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, where they are also known as noncrossing matchings and the Temperley-Lieb algebra, before being formalized by Kuperberg for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ as the morphisms in a diagrammatic categorification of quantum representations called the spider category. Various models extend webs to $n \geq 4$. Only Cautis-Kamnitzer-Morrison prove a full set of relations for their webs, though Fontaine's webs are better adapted to computations, more graph-theoretically natural, and directly generalize webs for $n=2$ and $n=3$. This paper formalizes the theory of Fontaine's webs, proving the existence of a deep and powerful global structure on these webs called strandings. We do three key things: 1) give a state-sum formula to construct ($U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_n)$-invariant) web vectors from the orientation of strandings on Fontaine's webs; 2) list and prove a complete set of relations, connecting strandings to the local data of binary labelings that are well-established in the literature; and 3) provide applications and examples of how strandings facilitate computations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The discrete Fourier transform has proven to be an essential tool in many geometric and combinatorial problems in vector spaces over finite fields. In general, sets with good uniform bounds for the Fourier transform appear more `random' and are easier to analyze. However, there is a trade-off: in many cases, obtaining good uniform bounds is not possible, even in situations where many points satisfy strong pointwise bounds. To address this limitation, the first named author proposed an approach where one attempts to replace the need for uniform ($L^\infty$) bounds with suitable bounds for the $L^p$ average of the Fourier transform. In subsequent joint work, the authors applied this approach successfully to improve known results in Fourier restriction and the study of orthogonal projections. In this survey we discuss this general approach, give several examples, and exhibit some of the recent applications.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, by some arithmetic properties of the Pell sequence and some $p$-adic tools, we study certain cyclotomic matrices involving squares over finite fields. For example, let $1=s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_{(q-1)/2}$ be all the nonzero squares over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, where $q=p^f$ is an odd prime power with $q\ge7$. We prove that the matrix $$B_q((q-3)/2)=\left[\left(s_i+s_j\right)^{(q-3)/2}\right]_{2\le i,j\le (q-1)/2}$$ is a singular matrix whenever $f\ge2$. Also, for the case $q=p$, we show that $$\det B_p((p-3)/2)=0\Leftrightarrow Q_p\equiv 2\pmod{p^2\mathbb{Z}},$$ where $Q_p$ is the $p$-th term of the companion Pell sequence $\{Q_i\}_{i=0}^{\infty}$ defined by $Q_0=Q_1=2$ and $Q_{i+1}=2Q_i+Q_{i-1}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Since the $\mathrm{Fibonacci}$ sequence has good properties, it's important in theory and applications, such as in combinatorics, cryptography, and so on. In this paper, for the generalized Fibonacci sequence $\left\{W_n\left(a,b,p,q\right)\right\}$, by using elementary methods and techniques, we respectively give the asymptotic estimation values of $\left(\sum\limits_{k=n}^{\infty}\frac{1}{W_{mk+l}^d}\right)^{-1}$ and $\left(\sum\limits_{k=n}^{\infty}\frac{\left(-1\right)^k}{W_{mk+l}^d}\right)^{-1}$, which generalize the asymptotic estimation results of Yuan et al. \cite{A14} in 2025.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is known that every matrix of order n over the maximal order in an algebraic number eld is a sum of k-th powers in various cases if a discriminant condition is satis ed. It has been proved by Wadikar and Katre that for every matrix of size 2 over maximal orders in rational quaternion division algebras is a sum of squares and cubes. In this paper we consider cyclic division algebras over Q of odd prime degree and show that under some conditions every matrix of size greater equal 2 over these noncommutative rings is a sum of squares and a sum of cubes.</p></details>
