### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14080v2'>2504.14080</a>\]&nbsp; **On minimal shapes and isoperimetric constants in hyperbolic lattices**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Matteo D'Achille, Vanessa Jacquier, Wioletta M. Ruszel &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 21 pages, 21 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We fully characterize the set of finite shapes with minimal perimeter on hyperbolic lattices given by regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane whose tiles are regular $p$-gons meeting at vertices of degree $q$, with $1/p+1/q<\frac{1}{2}$. In particular, we prove that the ratio between the perimeter and the area (i.e., the number of vertices) of this set of minimal shapes converges to the isoperimetric constant computed in H\"aggstr\"om-Jonasson-Lyons. In fact, our balls which are constructed via layers and not combinatorial balls, will realize the isoperimetric constant for any fixed number of vertices.</p></details>

We will apply our result to deduce a corollary towards the dynamical Mordell--Lang conjecture.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Bernhard Keller, Junyang Liu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 43 pages; v2: more accurate historical account in introduction, reference to Joyce-Safronov's work added, many minor changes; v3: references added, readability improved

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2015, Van den Bergh showed that complete 3-Calabi-Yau algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 are equivalent to Ginzburg dg algebras associated with quivers with potential. He also proved the natural generalisation to higher dimensions and non-algebraically closed ground fields. The relative version of the notion of Ginzburg dg algebra is that of Ginzburg morphism. For example, every ice quiver with potential gives rise to a Ginzburg morphism. We generalise Van den Bergh's theorem by showing that, under suitable assumptions, any morphism with a relative Calabi-Yau structure is equivalent to a Ginzburg(-Lazaroiu) morphism. In particular, in dimension 3 and over an algebraically closed ground field of characteristic 0, it is given by an ice quiver with potential. Thanks to the work of Bozec-Calaque-Scherotzke, this result can also be viewed as a non-commutative analogue of Joyce-Safronov's Lagrangian neighbourhood theorem in derived symplectic geometry.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{O}_K$ be a mixed characteristic complete DVR with perfect residue field $k$ and fraction field $K$. It is a celebrated result of Berthelot and Ogus that for a smooth proper formal scheme $X/\mathcal{O}_K$ there exists a comparison between the de Rham cohomology groups $\mathrm{H}^i_\mathrm{dR}(X/\mathcal{O}_K)$ and the crystalline cohomology groups $\mathrm{H}^i_\mathrm{crys}(X_k/W(k))$ of the special fibre, after tensoring with $K$. In this article, we use the stacky perspective on prismatic cohomology, due to Drinfeld and Bhatt--Lurie, to give a version of this comparison result with coefficients in a perfect complex of prismatic $F$-crystals on $X$. Our method is of an integral nature and suggests new tools to understand the relationship between torsion in de Rham and crystalline cohomology.</p></details>

> **Comment:** to appear in Ann. Math. Qu\'e

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $S_k$, the space of cusp forms of weight $k$ for the full modular group, we first introduce periods on $S_k$ associated to symmetric square $L$-functions. We then prove that for a fixed natural number $n$, if $k$ is sufficiently large relative to $n$, then any $n$ such periods are linearly independent. With some extra assumption, we also prove that for $k\geq e^{12}$, we can always pick up to $\frac{\log k}{4}$ arbitrary linearly independent periods.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17568v1'>2507.17568</a>\]&nbsp; **Obstruction theory for $A$-infinity bimodules**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gustavo Jasso, Fernando Muro &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 66 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop an obstruction theory for the extension of truncated minimal $A$-infinity bimodule structures over truncated minimal $A$-infinity algebras. Obstructions live in far-away pages of a (truncated) fringed spectral sequence of Bousfield--Kan type. The second page of this spectral sequence is mostly given by a new cohomology theory associated to a pair consisting of a graded algebra and a graded bimodule over it. This new cohomology theory fits in a long exact sequence involving the Hochschild cohomology of the algebra and the self-extensions of the bimodule. We show that the second differential of this spectral sequence is given by the Gerstenhaber bracket with a bimodule analogue of the universal Massey product of a minimal $A$-infinity algebra. We also develop a closely-related obstruction theory for truncated minimal $A$-infinity bimodule structures over (the truncation of) a fixed minimal $A$-infinity algebra; the second page of the corresponding spectral sequence is now mostly given by the vector spaces of self-extensions of the underlying graded bimodule and the second differential is described analogously to the previous one. We also establish variants of the above for graded algebras and graded bimodules that are $d$-sparse, that is they are concentrated in degrees that are multiples of a fixed integer $d\geq1$. These obstruction theories are used to establish intrinsic formality and almost formality theorems for differential graded bimodules over differential graded algebras. Our results hold, more generally, in the context of graded operads with multiplication equipped with an associative operadic ideal, examples of which are the endomorphism operad of a graded algebra and the linear endomorphism operad of a pair consisting of a graded algebra and a graded bimodule over it.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tongmu He &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 59 pages, to appear in J. Amer. Math. Soc

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Sen's theorem on the ramification of a $p$-adic analytic Galois extension of $p$-adic local fields shows that its perfectoidness is equivalent to the non-vanishing of its arithmetic Sen operator. By developing $p$-adic Hodge theory for general valuation rings, we establish a geometric analogue of Sen's criterion for any $p$-adic analytic Galois extension of $p$-adic varieties: its (Riemann-Zariski) stalkwise perfectoidness is necessary for the non-vanishing of the geometric Sen operators. As the latter is verified for general Shimura varieties by Pan and Camargo, we obtain the perfectoidness of every completed stalk of general Shimura varieties at infinite level at $p$. As an application, we prove that the integral completed cohomology groups vanish in higher degrees, verifying a conjecture of Calegari-Emerton for general Shimura varieties.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Metadata corrected

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $D$ be the quatenion division algebra over a non-Archimedean local field $F$ of characteristic zero and odd residual characterisitc. We show that an irreducible discrete series representation of $\mathrm{GL}_n(D)$ is $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$-distinguished only if it is supercuspidal. Here, $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$ is the quaternionic symplectic group. Combined with the recent study on $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$-distinguished supercuspidal representations by S\'echerre and Stevens, this completes the classification of $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$-distinguished discrete series representations, as predicted by Dipendra Prasad.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v3: numbering system changed to be consistent with the published version. Chinese version published in Chinese Ann. Math. Ser. A 45 (2024), no. 3, 287--296.; English translation in Chinese Journal of Contemporary Mathematics, 45 (2024) no. 3

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a quartic number field containing $\sqrt{2}$ and let $\mathcal{O}\subseteq K$ be an order such that $\sqrt{2}\in \mathcal{O}$. We prove that the Pythagoras number of $\mathcal{O}$ is at most 5. This confirms a conjecture of Kr\'{a}sensk\'{y}, Ra\v{s}ka and Sgallov\'a. The proof makes use of Beli's theory of bases of norm generators for quadratic lattices over dyadic local fields.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages, latex

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define the notion of a Lie superalgebra over a field $k$ of characteristic $2$ which unifies the two pre-existing ones - $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded Lie algebras with a squaring map and Lie algebras in the Verlinde category ${\rm Ver}_4^+(k)$, and prove the PBW theorem for this notion. We also do the same for the restricted version. Finally, discuss mixed characteristic deformation theory of such Lie superalgebras (for perfect $k$), introducing and studying a natural lift of our notion of Lie superalgebra to characteristic zero - the notion of a mixed Lie superalgebra over a ramified quadratic extension $R$ of the ring of Witt vectors $W(k)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce derived projective covers and explain how they are related to the notion of enough derived projectives. This provides an if-and-only-if criterion for when derived projective covers form a silting collection. We prove moreover a Koszul duality result for silting and simple-minded collections.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The multiplicative Horn problem is the following question: given three conjugacy classes $\mathcal{C}_1, \mathcal{C}_2, \mathcal{C}_3$ in a Lie group $G$, do there exist elements $(A,B,C)\in\mathcal{C}_1\times\mathcal{C}_2\times\mathcal{C}_3$ such that $ABC=\mathrm{Id}$? In this paper, we study the multiplicative Horn problem restricted to the elliptic classes of the group $G={\rm PU}(n,1)$ for $n\geq 1$, which is the isometry group of the $n$-dimensional complex hyperbolic space. We show that the solution set of Horn's problem in PU$(n,1)$ is a finite union of convex polytopes in the space of elliptic conjugacy classes. We give a complete description of these polytopes when $n=2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The study of dynamical systems involves analyzing how functions behave under iteration in different mathematical spaces. In the context of complex dynamics, tools such as Julia sets and filled Julia sets are used to understand the long-term behavior of functions in the complex Euclidean field. In this paper, we will present a review of Julia sets and filled Julia sets, provide an overview of the mathematical formulation of the alternated Julia sets introduced in the work of Danca-Romera-Pastor, extend it to the $p$-adic setting, and propose a tool that can potentially be used to study the arithmetic dynamics of various types of functions. Additionally, we will summarize key results on connectivity properties and visualization techniques as discussed in the work of Danca-Bourke-Romera and provide a visualization algorithm and pseudocode that enable the visualization of alternated Julia sets with various connectivity properties.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\rho: \Gamma \to G$ be an Anosov representation, with $\Gamma$ a word hyperbolic group and $G$ a semisimple Lie group. Previous works (by Guichard--Wienhard, Kapovich--Leeb--Porti, and recently Carvajales--Stecker) constructed an open domain of discontinuity $\Omega_\rho \subset G/H$, where $H$ is a parabolic or symmetric subgroup. In this paper, we extend the properly discontinuous $\Gamma$-action (via $\rho$) to the space of connections on the pullback of the tangent bundle over $\Omega_\rho$. When $\Omega_\rho$ is a complex surface, we show that the $\Gamma$-action is properly discontinuous on the union of the Higgs bundle structures of the $(1,0)$ part of the complexification of these pullback bundles. We further construct a topological free group $F$ generated by these holomorphic line bundles and show that $\rho(\Gamma)$ acts properly discontinuously on $F \setminus \{\mathrm{id}\}$. This free group is shown to be well-defined up to isomorphism over the character variety of Zariski dense Anosov representations. Finally, we endow the space of Anosov representations with a categorical structure and construct a natural functor to the category of free groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we refine a result of Andrews and Newman, that is, the sum of minimal excludants over all the partitions of a number $n$ equals the number of partitions of $n$ into distinct parts with two colors. As a consequence, we find congruences modulo 4 and 8 for the functions appearing in this refinement. We also conjecture three further congruences for these functions. In addition, we also initiate the study of $k^{th}$ moments of minimal excludants. At the end, we also provide an alternate proof of a beautiful identity due to Hopkins, Sellers and Stanton.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Edward Frenkel, David Hernandez &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 36 pages, v2: examples added in Section 6.1, to be published in the special issue of Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics in honor of Vyjayanthi Chari

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a construction of the Coulomb branch of a $3d\ {\mathcal N}=4$ gauge theory corresponding to a choice of a connected reductive group $G$ and a symplectic finite-dimensional reprsentation $\mathbf M$ of $G$, satisfying certain anomaly cancellation condition. This extends the construction of arXiv:1601.03586 (where it was assumed that ${\mathbf M}={\mathbf N}\oplus{\mathbf N}^*$ for some representation $\mathbf N$ of $G$). Our construction goes through certain "universal" ring object in the twisted derived Satake category of the symplectic group $Sp(2n)$. The construction of this object uses a categorical version of the Weil representation; we also compute the image of this object under the (twisted) derived Satake equivalence and show that it can be obtained from the theta-sheaf introduced by S.Lysenko on $\mathrm{Bun}_{Sp(2n)}({\mathbb P}^1)$ via certain Radon transform. We also discuss applications of our construction to a potential mathematical construction of $S$-duality for super-symmetric boundary conditions in 4-dimensional gauge theory and to (some extension of) the conjectures of D.Ben-Zvi, Y.Sakellaridis and A.Venkatesh.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 64 pages, many figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that a vector space valued TQFT constructed in work of De Renzi et al. [DGGPR23] extends naturally to a topological field theory which takes values in the symmetric monoidal category of linear cochains. Specifically, we consider a bordism category whose objects are surfaces with markings from the category of cochains Ch(A) over a given modular tensor category (such as the category of small quantum group representations), and whose morphisms are 3-dimensional bordisms with embedded ribbon graphs traveling between such marked surfaces. We construct a symmetric monoidal functor from the aforementioned ribbon bordism category to the category of linear cochains. The values of this theory on surfaces are identified with Hom complexes for Ch(A), and the 3-manifold invariants are alternating sums of the renormalized Lyubashenko invariant from [DGGPR23]. We show that our cochain valued TQFT furthermore preserves homotopies, and hence localizes to a theory which takes values in the derived $\infty$-category of dg vector spaces. The domain for this $\infty$-categorical theory is, up to some approximation, an $\infty$-category of ribbon bordism with labels in the homotopy $\infty$-category K(A). We suggest our localized theory as a starting point for the construction of a "derived TQFT" for the $\infty$-category of derived quantum group representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let R be a commutative Noetherian local ring. We give a characterization of when the completion of R has an isolated singularity. This result simultaneously improves a theorem of Dao and Takahashi and a theorem of Bahlekeh, Hakimian, Salarian, and Takahashi. As an application, we strengthen the Auslander-Huneke-Leuschke-Wiegand theorem in the form refined by Dao and Takahashi. We further investigate the ascent and descent of finite and countable syzygy representation type along the canonical map from R to its completion. As a consequence, we obtain a complete affirmative answer to Schreyer's conjecture. We also explore analogues of Chen's questions in the context of finite Cohen-Macaulay representation type over Cohen-Macaulay rings. The main result in this direction shows that if R is Cohen-Macaulay and there are only finitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules that are locally free on the punctured spectrum, then either R is a hypersurface or every Gorenstein projective module is projective, and every Gorenstein projective module over the completion of R is a direct sum of finitely generated ones. Finally, we study dominant local rings, introduced by Takahashi, under certain finite representation type conditions, and identify a new class of virtually Gorenstein rings.</p></details>

For any non-decreasing positive function $\varphi:\mathbb{N}\to [2,\infty)$, we determine the Lebesgue measure and Hausdorff dimension of the set $\mathcal{F}_{\ell}(\vphi)$ of irrational numbers $x$ whose regular continued fraction $x~=~[a_1(x),a_2(x),\ldots]$ is such that for infinitely many $n\in\Na$ there are two numbers $1\leq j<k \leq n$ satisfying $$ a_{k}(x)a_{k+1}(x)a_{k+2}(x) \geq \varphi(n), \; a_{j}(x)a_{j+1}(x)a_{j+2}(x) \geq \varphi(n). $$ One of the consequences of the results is that the strong law of large numbers for products of $3$ consecutive partial quotients is impossible even if the block with the largest product is removed.</p></details>

We revisit this functor and relate it to the restriction functor constructed by Losev between Harish-Chandra bimodules and bimodules over $W$-algebra associated to the regular nilpotent element. We compute the images of certain Harish-Chandra bimodules under the restriction functor and provide alternative proofs for many properties of the functor constructed by Soergel. Blocks of Harish-Chandra bimodules with integral central characters were studied in the works of Soergel and Stroppel. We will generalize results of Soergel and Stroppel in the case of integral blocks to general blocks.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $S_k$ denote the space of cusp forms of weight $k$ and level one. For $0\leq t\leq k-2$ and primitive Dirichlet character $\chi$ mod $D$, we introduce twisted periods $r_{t,\chi}$ on $S_k$. We show that for a fixed natural number $n$, if $k$ is sufficiently large relative to $n$ and $D$, then any $n$ periods with the same twist but different indices are linearly independent. We also prove that if $k$ is sufficiently large relative to $D$ then any $n$ periods with the same index but different twists mod $D$ are linearly independent. These results are achieved by studying the trace of the products and Rankin-Cohen brackets of Eisenstein series of level $D$ with nebentypus. Moreover, we give two applications of our method. First, we prove certain identities that evaluate convolution sums of twisted divisor functions. Second, we show that Maeda's conjecture implies a non-vanishing result on twisted central $L$-values of normalized Hecke eigenforms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Markov numbers, i.e. positive integers appearing in solutions to $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz$, can be viewed as specializations of cluster variables. The second author and Matsushita gave a generalization of the Markov equation, $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k_1yz + k_2xz + k_3xy = (3+k_1+k_2+k_3)xyz$, whose solutions can be viewed as specializations of cluster variables in generalized cluster algebras. We give two families of matrices in $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}[x_1^\pm,x_2^\pm,x_3^\pm])$ associated to these cluster structures. These matrix formulas relate to previous matrices appearing in the context of Markov numbers, including Cohn matrices and generalized Cohn matrices given by the second author, Maruyama, and Sato, as well as matrices appearing in the context of cluster algebras, including matrix formulas given by Kanatarc{\i} O\u{g}uz and Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m. We provide a classification of the two families of matrices and exhibit an explicit family of each. The latter is done by realizing cluster variables in generalized Markov cluster algebras as weight-generating functions of order ideals in certain fence posets which are related to Christoffel words. An interesting observation is that these functions resemble Caldero-Chapoton functions for string modules, and a byproduct of our proofs is a new skein-like formula for such functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate trace and observability inequalities for Laplace eigenfunctions on the d-dimensional torus, with respect to arbitrary Borel measures $\mu$. Specifically, we characterize the measures $\mu$ for which the inequalities $$ \int |u|^2 d \mu \lesssim \int |u|^2 d x \quad \text{(trace)}, \qquad \int |u|^2 d \mu \gtrsim \int |u|^2 d x \quad \text{(observability)}$$ hold uniformly for all eigenfunctions $u$ of the Laplacian. Sufficient conditions are derived based on the integrability and regularity of $\mu$, while necessary conditions are formulated in terms of the dimension of the support of the measure. These results generalize classical theorems of Zygmund and Bourgain--Rudnick to higher dimensions. Applications include results in the spirit of Cantor--Lebesgue theorems, constraints on quantum limits, and control theory for the Schr\"odinger equation. Our approach combines several tools: the cluster structure of lattice points on spheres; decoupling estimates; and the construction of eigenfunctions exhibiting strong concentration or vanishing behavior, tailored respectively to the trace and observability inequalities.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the group $\mathcal G$ which is the semidirect product of the group of analytic functions with values in ${\mathbb C}^*$ on the circle and the group of analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle that preserve the orientation. Then we construct the central extensions of the group $\mathcal G$ by the group ${\mathbb C}^*$. The first central extension, so-called the determinant central extension, is constructed by means of determinants of linear operators acting in infinite-dimensional locally convex topological $\mathbb C$-vector spaces. Other central extensions are constructed by $\cup$-products of group $1$-cocycles with the application to them the map related with algebraic $K$-theory. We prove in the second cohomology group, i.e. modulo of a group $2$-coboundary, the equality of the $12$th power of the $2$-cocycle constructed by the first central extension and the product of integer powers of the $2$-cocycles constructed above by means of $\cup$-products (in multiplicative notation). As an application of this result we obtain the new topological Riemann-Roch theorem for a complex line bundle $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$, where $\pi :M \to B$ is a fibration in oriented circles. More precisely, we prove that in the group $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ the element $12 \, [ {\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is equal to the element $6 \, \pi_* ( c_1(L) \cup c_1(L))$, where $[{\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is the class of the determinant gerbe on $B$ constructed by $L$ and the determinant central extension.</p></details>

For every $k\geq 0,$ we obtain exact formulas for the quasimodular expressions of $\widehat{A}_k$ and $L_k$ as ``traces'' of partition Eisenstein series $$ \widehat{\mathcal{A}}_k(\tau)= \mathrm{Tr}_k(\phi_{\widehat{A}};\tau)\ \ \ \ \ \ {\text {and}}\ \ \ \ \ \ \mathcal{L}_k(\tau)= \mathrm{Tr}_k(\phi_L;\tau), $$ which are easily converted to the original topological expressions. Surprisingly, Ramanujan defined twists of the $\widehat{\mathcal{A}}_k(\tau)$ in his ``lost notebook'' in his study of derivatives of theta functions, decades before Borel and Hirzebruch rediscovered them in the context of spin manifolds.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A quasi-hereditary algebra is an algebra equipped with a certain partial order $\unlhd$ on its simple modules. Such a partial order -- called a quasi-hereditary structure -- gives rise to a characteristic tilting module $T_{\unlhd}$ by a classical result due to Ringel. A fundamental question is to determine which tilting modules can be realised as characteristic tilting modules. We answer this question by using the notion of IS-tilting module, which is a pair $(T,\unlhd)$ of a tilting module $T$ and a partial order $\unlhd$ on its direct summands such that iterative idempotent truncation along $\unlhd$ always reveals a simple direct summand. Specifically, we show that a tilting module $T$ is characteristic if, and only if, there is some $\unlhd$ so that $(T,\unlhd)$ is IS-tilting; in which case, we have $T=T_{\unlhd}$. This result enables us to study quasi-hereditary structures using tilting theory. As an application of the above result, we show that, for an algebra $A$, all tilting modules are characteristic if, and only if, $A$ is a quadratic linear Nakayama algebra. Furthermore, for such an $A$, we provide a decomposition of the set of its tilting modules that can be used to derive a recursive formula for enumerating its quasi-hereditary structures. Finally, we describe the quasi-hereditary structures of $A$ via `nodal gluing' and binary tree sequences.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the theory of integral weight harmonic Maass forms of manageable growth, two key differential operators, the Bol operator and the shadow operator, play a fundamental role. Harmonic Maass forms of manageable growth canonically split into two parts, and each operator controls one of these parts. A third operator, called the flipping operator, exchanges the role of these two parts. Maass--Poincar\'e series (of parabolic type) form a convenient basis of negative weight harmonic Maass forms of manageable growth, and flipping has the effect of negating an index. Recently, there has been much interest in locally harmonic Maass forms defined by the first author, Kane, and Kohnen. These are lifts of Poincar\'e series of hyperbolic type, and are intimately related to the Shimura and Shintani lifts. In this note, we prove that a similar property holds for the flipping operator applied to these Poincar\'e series.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the unweighted error-sum function $\mathcal{E}(x) \coloneqq \sum_{n \geq 0} ( x- p_n(x)/q_n(x) )$, where $p_n(x)/q_n(x)$ is the $n$th convergent of the continued fraction expansion of $x \in \mathbb{R}$. We prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of $\mathcal{E}$ is exactly $1$. Our proof is number-theoretic in nature and involves M\"obius inversion, summation over coprime convergent denominators, and precise upper bounds derived via continued fraction recurrence relations. As a supplementary result, we rederive the known upper bound of $3/2$ for the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of the relative error-sum function $P(x) \coloneqq \sum_{n \geq 0} (q_n(x)x-p_n(x))$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Uchimura, in 1987, introduced a probability generating function for a random variable $X$ and using properties of this function he discovered an interesting $q$-series identity. He further showed that the $m$-th cumulant with respect to the random variable $X$ is nothing but the generating function for the generalized divisor function $\sigma_{m-1}(n)$. Simon, Crippa, and Collenberg, in 1993, explored the $G_{n,p}$-model of a random acyclic digraph and defined a random variable $\gamma_n^{*}(1)$. Quite interestingly, they found links between limit of its mean and the generating function for the divisor function $d(n)$. Later in 1997, Andrews, Crippa and Simon extended these results using $q$-series techniques. They calculated limit of the mean and variance of the random variable $\gamma_n^{*}(1)$ which correspond to the first and second cumulants. In this paper, we generalize the result of Andrews, Crippa and Simon by calculating limit of the $t$-th cumulant in terms of the generalized divisor function. Furthermore, we also discover limit forms for identities of Uchimura and Dilcher. This provides a fourth side to the Uchimura-Ramanujan-divisor type three way partition identities expounded by the first four authors recently.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1973, Calder\'{o}n proved that an $m \times 2$ positive semidefinite (psd) biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of squares (sos) of ${3m(m+1) \over 2}$ quadratic forms. Very recently, by applying Hilbert's theorem, we proved that a $2 \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of squares of three quadratic forms. This improved Calder\'{o}n's result for $m=2$, and left the sos rank problem of $m \times 2$ biquadratic forms for $m \ge 3$ to further exploration. In this paper, we show that an $m \times n$ psd biquadratic form with a nontrivial zero {can} be expressed as an $(m-1) \times (n-1) \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic form. Furthermore, we show that an $m \times 2$ positive definite (pd) biquadratic form can be expressed as the sum of a square of a quadratic form, and an $(m-1) \times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic form. Thus, the sos rank problem of $m \times 2$ psd biquadratic forms is reduced to the sos rank problem of an $(m-1) \times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic forms. We then show that an $(m-1) \times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic form has at least two nontrivial zeros, and the discriminent of a $2 \times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic form can be expressed as the sum of the square of three cubic forms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we elucidate the advantage of examining the connections between Hilbert-Kamke equations and geometric designs, or Chebyshev-type quadrature, for classical orthogonal polynomials. We first establish that if a $5$-design with $6$ rational points for a symmetric classical measure is parametrized by rational functions, then the corresponding measure should be the Chebyshev measure $(1-t^2)^{-1/2}dt/\pi$ on $(-1,1)$. Our proof is based on the collaboration of a certain polynomial identity and some advanced techniques on the computation of the genus of a certain irreducible curve. Next, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of rational $5$-designs for the Chebyshev measure. Moreover, as one of our main theorems, we construct an infinite family of ideal solutions for the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott (PTE) problem by utilizing rational $5$-designs for the Chebyshev measure, and then establish that, up to affine equivalence over $\mathbb{Q}$, such ideal solutions are included in the famous parametric solutions found by Borwein (2002).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Last passage percolation (LPP) in an $n\times n$ lower triangular domain has nice connections with various generalizations of Schur measures. LPP along an anti-diagonal, from $(1,n)$ to $(n,1)$, gives a distribution of a highest column of a random composition with respect to a Demazure measure (a non-symmetric analog of a Schur measure). LPP along a main diagonal, from $(1,1)$ to $(n,n)$, is distributed as a marginal of a Pfaffian Schur process. In the first case we show that the asymptotics for the constant specialization is governed by the GOE Tracy-Widom distribution, in the second case - by the GSE Tracy-Widom distribution. In the latter case we were also able to study the truncated lower triangular case, obtaining an interesting generalization of the GSE Tracy-Widom distribution.</p></details>

Based on work of Lusztig and Yun, we make the Jordan decomposition for irreducible G-representations canonical.

Next we generalize these results, replacing the connected reductive group by a smooth group scheme with reductive neutral component. Again we establish canonical equivalences for both the rational and the geometric series of G-representations, in terms of unipotent representations of endoscopic groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a local field of characteristic $p$ and $G$ be a connected reductive group over $F$. Recall that Shalika's germ expansion of orbital integrals of regular semi-simple elements near the identity, when it exists, is a sum indexed by the set of unipotent conjugacy classes in $G(F)$. Observe that if $G=SL(2)$ this set is always compact; it is finite if $p\ne2$ while it is uncountable if $p= 2$. As a consequence, Shalika's germ expansion for elliptic elements does not make sense if $p=2$. On the other hand the endoscopic expansion of elliptic orbital integrals always exists and yields a germ expansion equivalent if $p\ne2$ (up to a Fourier transform) to Shalika's germ expansion but is new if $p=2$. A conjecture for arbitrary groups is stated.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Digital signatures are essential cryptographic tools that provide authentication and integrity in digital communications. However, privacy-sensitive applications, such as e-voting and digital cash, require more restrictive verification models to ensure confidentiality and control. Strong Designated Verifier Signature (SDVS) schemes address this need by enabling the signer to designate a specific verifier, ensuring that only this party can validate the signature. Existing SDVS constructions are primarily based on number-theoretic assumptions and are therefore vulnerable to quantum attacks. Although post-quantum alternatives, particularly those based on lattices, have been proposed, they often entail large key and signature sizes. In this work, we introduce $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$, a novel isogeny-based SDVS scheme that offers a compact, quantum-resistant alternative. Our construction builds on the ideal class group action framework of CSIDH and the signature techniques of CSI-FiSh, and relies on the hardness of the Multi-Target Group Action Inverse Problem (MT-GAIP). $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$ achieves strong security guarantees; namely, Strong Unforgeability under Chosen-Message Attacks (SUF-CMA), Non-Transferability (NT), and Privacy of Signer's Identity (PSI), in the random oracle model. Remarkably, both the keys and signatures in $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$ are of size $\mathcal{O}(\lambda)$, representing a significant improvement over the typical $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^2)$ bounds in existing post-quantum SDVS schemes, thereby making it among the most compact PQC-based SDVS schemes and the only post-quantum secure construction based on isogenies.</p></details>

Newman studied the modularity of eta-quotients, giving necessary and sufficient conditions for a function of the form \prod_{0 < m | N} eta(mz)^{r_m} to be a (weakly) holomorphic modular form of level N. We explain a proof of Newman's theorem, developed while teaching a class for talented high school students at Canada/USA Mathcamp. The key observation is that although Gamma_1(N) is not generated by its upper triangular and lower triangular subgroups, it is generated by those subgroups together with any congruence subgroup. Modularity with respect to some congruence subgroup is established using one simple identity involving the multiplier system of eta(z), whose proof is elementary in the sense that it avoids the use of Dedekind sums.</p></details>

We show that the asymptotic character of a module computes the equivariant multiplicity of its characteristic cycle. We then apply this construction to truncated shifted Yangians coming from simple, simply-laced Lie algebras and draw connections with characters of modules over KLR algebras using an equivalence of categories of arXiv:1806.07519. Our main theorem shows how this new formalism gives formulas relating equivariant multiplicities of Mirkovi\'{c}-Vilonen cycles and characters of modules over cyclotomic KLR algebras. We explain how this result provides evidence that the change-of-basis between Lusztig's dual canonical basis and the Mirkovi\'{c}-Vilonen basis of $\mathbb{C}[N]$ is computed by a characteristic cycle map whose domain is category $\mathcal{O}$ for truncated shifted Yangians, implying that the coefficients are non-negative integers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The descent method is one of the approaches to study the Brauer--Manin obstruction to the local--global principle and to weak approximation on varieties over number fields, by reducing the problem to ``descent varieties''. In recent lecture notes by Wittenberg, he formulated a ``descent conjecture'' for torsors under linear algebraic groups. The present article gives a proof of this conjecture in the case of connected groups, generalizing the toric case from the previous work of Harpaz--Wittenberg. As an application, we deduce directly from Sansuc's work the theorem of Borovoi for homogeneous spaces of connected linear algebraic groups with connected stabilizers. We are also able to reduce the general case to the case of finite (\'etale) torsors. When the set of rational points is replaced by the Chow group of zero-cycles, an analogue of the above conjecture for arbitrary linear algebraic groups is proved.</p></details>

To illustrate the utility of our point counts algorithm in addressing arithmetic questions, we prove that all automorphisms are Atkin--Lehner for many curves $X_0^D(N)$ with $DN\leq 10000$, and we determine all tetragonal curves $X_0^D(N)$ up to a small number of possible exceptions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to better understand a family of linear degenerations of the classical Lagrangian Grassmannians $\Lambda(2n)$. It is the special case for $k=n$ of the varieties $X(k,2n)^{sp}$, introduced in previous joint work with Evgeny Feigin, Martina Lanini and Alexander P\"utz. These varieties are obtained as isotropic subvarieties of a family of quiver Grassmannians $X(n,2n)$, and are acted on by a linear degeneration of the algebraic group $Sp_{2n}$. We prove a conjecture proposed in the paper above for this particular case, which states that the ordering on the set of orbits in $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ given by closure-inclusion coincides with a combinatorially defined order on what are called symplectic $(n,2n)$-juggling patterns, much in the same way that the $Sp_{2n}$ orbits in $\Lambda(2n)$ are parametrized by a type C Weyl group with the Bruhat order. The dimension of such orbits is computed via the combinatorics of bounded affine permutations, and it coincides with the length of some permutation in a Coxeter group of affine type C. Furthermore, the varieties $X(n,2n)$ are GKM, that is, they have trivial cohomology in odd degree and are equipped with the action of an algebraic torus with finitely many fixed points and 1-dimensional orbits. In this paper it is proven that $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ is also GKM.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In previous work we computed the number $C_n(q)$ of ideals of codimension $n$ of the algebra ${\mathbb{F}}_q[x,y,x^{-1}, y^{-1}]$ of two-variable Laurent polynomials over a finite field: it turned out that $C_n(q)$ is a palindromic polynomial of degree $2n$ in $q$, divisible by $(q-1)^2$. The quotient $P_n(q) = C_n(q)/(q-1)^2$ is a palindromic polynomial of degree $2n-2$. For each $n\geq 1$ there is a unique degree $n-1$ polynomial ${\overline{P}}_n(X) \in {\mathbb{Z}}[X]$ such that ${\overline{P}}_n(q+q^{-1}) = P_n(q)/q^{n-1}$. In this note we show that for any integer $N$ the integer value ${\overline{P}}_n(N)$ is close to the value at $N$ of the degree $n-1$ polynomial $F_{n-1}(X) = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \, {\overline{T}}_k(X)$, which is a sum of monic versions ${\overline{T}}_k(X)$ of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. We give a precise formula for ${\overline{P}}_n(X)$ as a linear combination of $F_k(X)$'s, each appearance of the latter being parametrized by an odd divisor of $n$. As a consequence, ${\overline{P}}_n(X) = F_{n-1}(X)$ if and only if $n$ is a power of $2$. We exhibit similar formulas for $C_n(q)$.</p></details>

Our construction is non-$\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant in general, but it uses the classical $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant motivic cohomology of smooth $\mathbb{Z}$-schemes as an input. The main new input of our construction is a global filtration on topological cyclic homology, whose graded pieces provide an integral refinement of derived de Rham cohomology and Bhatt--Morrow--Scholze's syntomic cohomology. Our theory satisfies various expected properties of motivic cohomology, including relations to \'etale cohomology and to non-connective algebraic $K$-theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we generalize the notion of character for 2-representations of finite 2-groups. The properties of 2-characters bear strong similarities to those classical characters of finite groups, including conjugation invariance, additivity, multiplicativity and orthogonality. With a careful analysis using homotopy fixed points and quotients for categories with 2-group actions, we prove that the category of class functors on a 2-group $\mathcal G$ is equivalent to the Drinfeld center of the 2-group algebra $\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathcal G}$, which categorifies the Fourier transform on finite abelian groups. After transferring the canonical nondegenerate braided monoidal structure from $\mathfrak Z_1(\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathcal G})$, we discover that irreducible 2-characters of $\mathcal G$ coincide with full centers of the corresponding 2-representations, which are in a one-to-one correspondence with Lagrangian algebras in the category of class functors on $\mathcal G$. In particular, the fusion rule of $2\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal G)$ can be calculated from the pointwise product of Lagrangian algebras as class functors. From a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) point of view, the commutative Frobenius algebra structure on a 2-character is induced from a 2D topological sigma-model with target space $\lvert \mathrm{B} \mathcal G \rvert$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Polynomial optimization problems often arise in sequences indexed by dimension, and it is of interest to produce bounds on the optimal values of all problems in the sequence. Examples include certifying inequalities between symmetric functions or graph homomorphism densities that hold over vectors and graphs of all sizes, and computing the value of mean-field games viewed as limits of games with a growing number of players. In this paper, we study such any-dimensional polynomial problems using the theory of representation stability, and we develop a systematic framework to produce hierarchies of bounds for their limiting optimal values in terms of finite-dimensional polynomial optimization problems. Our bounds converge at explicit rates, and they follow as a consequence of new de Finetti-type theorems pertaining to sequences of random arrays projecting onto each other in different ways. The proofs of these theorems are based on applying results from probability to representations of certain categories. We apply our framework to produce new bounds on problems arising in a number of application domains such as mean-field games, extremal graph theory, and symmetric function theory, and we illustrate our methods via numerical experiments.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Lapid and M\'{i}nguez gave a criterion of the irreducibility of the parabolic induction $\sigma \times \pi$, where $\sigma$ is a ladder representation and $\pi$ is an arbitrary irreducible representation of the general linear group over a non-archimedean field. Through quantum affine Schur-Weyl duality, when $k$ is large enough, this gives a criterion of the irreducibility of the tensor product of a snake module $L(M)$ and any simple module $L(N)$ of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_k})$. The goal of this paper is to add conditions to their criterion such that it works for any $k \geq 1$. We prove the criterion in the case where both modules are snake modules or one of them is a fundamental module at an extremity node and the other is any simple module. We also defined a similar criterion in the Grassmannian cluster algebra $\mathbb{C}[\mathrm{Gr}(k,n, \sim)]$, and show that for any $k \geq 1$, two ladders are compatible if and only if the corresponding tableaux satisfy the criterion. This generalizes Leclerc and Zelevinsky's result that two Pl\"{u}cker coordinates are compatible if and only if they are weakly separated.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>First, we prove an algebraization result for rig-smooth algebras over a general noetherian ring; this positively answers the question raised in [Sta24, Tag 0GAX]. Then we prove a general partial algebraization result in non-archimedean geometry. The result says that we can always algebraize a geometrically reduced affinoid rigid-analytic space in "one direction" in an appropriate sense. As an application of this result, we show the remaining cases of the Artin-Grothendieck Vanishing for affinoid algebras, which were previously conjectured in [BM21, {\S}7]. This allows us to deduce a stronger version of the rigid-analytic Artin-Grothendieck Vanishing Conjecture (see [Han20, Conj. 1.2]) over a field of characteristic 0. Using a completely different set of ideas, we also obtain a weaker version of this conjecture over a field of characteristic p>0.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Ingham (1940) proved that $N(\sigma,T)\ll T^{3(1-\sigma)/(2-\sigma)}\log^{5}{T}$, where $N(\sigma,T)$ counts the number of the non-trivial zeros $\rho$ of the Riemann zeta-function with $\Re\{\rho\}\geq\sigma\geq 1/2$ and $0<\Im\{\rho\}\leq T$. We provide an explicit version of this result with the exponent $3$ of the logarithmic factor. In addition, we also provide an explicit estimate with asymptotically correct main term for the fourth power moment of the Riemann zeta-function on the critical line.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the Theta Partial operator $\theta(y\mathbf{D}_{\lambda})$, based on the $\lambda$-derivative operator $\mathbf{D}_{\lambda}$, and use it to define the following generalization of the Lambert series \begin{equation*} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}\frac{x^{n+1}}{x-\lambda^ny}z^n. \end{equation*} Also, we define generalized Lambert-Mehler and Lambert-Rogers type series, double-sum bivariate generalized Lambert series and multivariate generalized Lambert series. A list of interesting generalized Lambert series is provided by using elementary functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give an overview of Darmon's program for resolving families of generalized Fermat equations with one varying exponent and survey what is currently known about this approach based on recent work of Billerey-Chen-Dieulefait-Freitas and Chen-Koutsianas. Additionally, we provide background material which is helpful to understand and apply the methods developed in these recent works. In particular, we explain the basic strategy for and simplified examples of each of the steps that is required in order to resolve a family of generalized Fermat equations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $G$ a finite group, $k$ a field of prime characteristic $p$, and $S$ a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$, the Sylow permutation module $\mathrm{Ind}^G_S(k)$ plays a role in diverse facets of representation theory and group theory, ranging from Alperin's weight conjecture to statistical considerations of $S$-$S$-double cosets in $G$. The Sylow permutation module breaks up along the block decomposition of the group algebra $kG$, but the resulting block components are not invariant under splendid Morita equivalences. We introduce a summand of the block component, which we call source permutation module, which is shown to be invariant under such equivalences. We investigate general structural properties of the source permutation module and we show that well-known results relating the self-injectivity of the endomorphism algebra of the Sylow permutation to Alperin's weight conjecture carry over to the source permutation module. We calculate this module in various cases, such as certain blocks with cyclic defect group and blocks with a Klein four defect group, and for some blocks of symmetric groups, prompted by a question in a recent paper by Diaconis-Giannelli-Guralnick-Law-Navarro-Sambale-Spink on the self-injectivity of the endomorphism algebra of the Sylow permutation module for symmetric groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine the exact group structure of the abelianization of $\text{SL}_2(A)$, where $A$ is a Dedekind domain of arithmetic type with infinitely many units. In particular, our results show that $\text{SL}_2(A)^\text{ab}$ is finite, with exponent dividing $12$ when $\text{char}(A)=0$, and dividing $6$ when $\text{char}(A)>0$. As illustrative cases, we compute $\text{SL}_2(A)^\text{ab}$ explicitly for instances where $A$ is the ring of integers of a real quadratic field or a cyclotomic extension.</p></details>
