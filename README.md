 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Meghan Lee &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An isolated point of degree $d$ is a closed point on an algebraic curve which does not belong to an infinite family of degree $d$ points that can be parameterized by some geometric object. We provide an algorithm to test whether a rational, non-CM $j$-invariant gives rise to an isolated point on the modular curve $X_0(n)$, for any $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, using key results from Menendez and Zywina. This work is inspired by the prior algorithm of Bourdon et al. which tests whether a rational, non-CM $j$-invariant gives rise to an isolated point on any modular curve $X_1(n)$. From the implementation of our algorithm, we determine that the set of $j$-invariants corresponding to isolated points on $X_1(n)$ is neither a subset nor a superset of those corresponding to isolated points on $X_0(n)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a noncommutative algebra $A$ and an antilinear automorphism $\rho$ of $A$ there is a notion of a positive trace. Positive traces appear in study of supersymmetric gauge theories. We classify positive traces on $A$ in two cases. The first case is when $A$ is a quantization of a Kleinian singularity of type $D$, with certain restriction on the quantization parameter. The second case is when $A=K^{\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C}[[t]])\rtimes \mathbb{C}_q^{\times}}(\mathrm{Gr}_{\mathrm{PGL}_2})$ is an algebra containing $K$-theoretic Coulomb branches of pure $\mathrm{SL}(2)$ and $\mathrm{PGL}(2)$ gauge theories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a simple Lie group, and $\mathfrak{g}$ its Lie algebra. It is well known that a $G$-module $V$ carrying an invariant symplectic form or an invariant scalar product gives rise to a Hamiltonian Poisson space with a quadratic moment maps $\mu$. We show that under condition ${\rm Hom}_{\mathfrak{g}}(\wedge^3 V, S^3V)=0$ this space can be viewed as a quasi-Poisson space with the same bivector, and with the group valued moment map $\Phi = \exp \circ \mu$. Furthermore, we show that by modifying the bivector by the standard $r$-matrix for $\mathfrak{g}$ one obtains a space with a Poisson action of the Poisson-Lie group $G$, and with the moment map in the sense of Lu taking values in the dual Poisson-Lie group $G^\ast$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gaurav Aggarwal, Anish Ghosh &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The L\'evy-Khintchine theorem is a classical result in Diophantine approximation that describes the asymptotic growth of the denominators of convergents in the continued fraction expansion of a typical real number. An effective version of this theorem was proved by Phillip and Stackelberg (\textit{Math. Annalen}, 1969) and Central Limit Theorems were proved by several authors \cites{Ibragimov, Misevicius, Morita, Vallee}. In this work, we develop a new approach towards quantifying the L\'evy-Khintchine theorem. Our methods apply to the setting of higher-dimensional simultaneous Diophantine approximation, thereby providing an effective version of a theorem of Cheung and Chevallier (\textit{Annales scientifiques de l'ENS}, 2024). Further, we prove a Central Limit Theorem for best approximations in all dimensions. Unlike previous approaches to the one-dimensional problem, our approach relies on techniques from homogeneous dynamics.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Alessandro Ardizzoni, Claudia Menini, Paolo Saracco &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Hopf envelope of a bialgebra is the free Hopf algebra generated by the given bialgebra. Its existence, as well as that of the cofree Hopf algebra, is a well-known fact in Hopf algebra theory, but their construction is not particularly handy or friendly. In this note, we offer a novel realisation of the Hopf envelope and of the cofree Hopf algebra of a finite-dimensional bialgebra as a particular quotient and sub-bialgebra, respectively, of the bialgebra itself. Our construction can also be extended to the infinite-dimensional case, provided that the bialgebra satisfies additional conditions, such as being left Artinian as an algebra or admitting a $n$-antipode, the latter being a notion hereby introduced. Remarkably, the machinery we develop also allows us to give a new description of the Hopf envelope of a commutative bialgebra and of the cofree cocommutative Hopf algebra of a cocommutative bialgebra.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 8 pages + references

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Denote by $E_r$ the $r^{th}$ elementary symmetric polynomial in $\dim V$ variables for a vector space $V$ over an infinite field $\Bbbk$. We describe the rational points on the Fano scheme $F_{d-1}(Z(E_{\dim V-1}))$ of projective $(d-1)$-spaces contained in the zero locus of $E_{\dim V-1}$. Isolated points exist precisely for $\dim V=2d$, in which case they are in bijection with the $1\cdot 3\cdots (2d-1)$ pairings on a $2d$-element set. This, in particular, confirming a conjecture of Ambartsoumian, Auel and Jebelli to the effect that (over $\mathbb{R}$) all isolated points are recoverable via integral star transforms with appropriate symbols.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 19 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We discuss the critical points of modular forms, or more generally the zeros of quasimodular forms of depth $1$ for $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb Z)$. In particular, we consider the derivatives of the unique weight $k$ modular forms $f_k$ with the maximal number of consecutive zero Fourier coefficients following the constant $1$. Our main results state that (1) every zero of a depth $1$ quasimodular form near the derivative of the Eisenstein series in the standard fundamental domain lies on the geodesic segment $\{z \in \mathbb H: \Re(z)=1/2\}$, and (2) more than half of zeros of $f_k$ in the standard fundamental domain lie on the geodesic segment $\{z \in \mathbb H: \Re(z)=1/2\}$ for large enough $k$ with $k\equiv 0 \pmod{12}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak g$ be a complex semisimple Lie algebra. We define what it means for a finite dimensional representation of $\mathfrak g$ to be rectangular and completely classify faithful rectangular representations. As an application, we obtain new $\lambda$-independence results on the algebraic monodromy groups of compatible systems of $\lambda$-adic Galois representations of number fields.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gérald Tenenbaum &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $r,\,f$ be multiplicative functions with $r\geqslant 0$, $f$ is complex valued, $|f|\leqslant r$, and $r$ satisfies some standard growth hypotheses. Let $x$ be large, and assume that, for some real number $\tau$, the quantities $r(p)-\Re\{f(p)/p^{i\tau}\}$ are small in various appropriate average senses over the set of prime numbers not exceeding $x$. We derive from recent effective mean-value estimates an effective comparison theorem between the mean-values of $f$ and of $r$ on the set of integers $\leqslant x$. We also provide effective estimates for certain weighted moments of additive functions and for sifted mean-values of non-negative multiplicative functions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gaurav Aggarwal, Anish Ghosh &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 19 Pages, Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish effective convergence rates in the Doeblin-Lenstra law, describing the limiting distribution of approximation coefficients arising from continued fraction convergents of a typical real number. More generally, we prove quantitative versions of the Doeblin-Lenstra law for best approximates in higher dimensions, as well as for points sampled from fractal measures on the real line, including the middle-third Cantor measure. Our method reduces the problem to proving effective convergence of Birkhoff averages for diagonal flows on spaces of unimodular lattices. A key step is to show that, despite the discontinuity of the observable of interest, it satisfies the regularity conditions on average required for effective ergodic theorems. For the fractal setting, we establish effective multi-equidistribution properties of self-similar measures under diagonal flow, extending recent work on single equidistribution by B\'enard, He and Zhang. As a consequence, we also obtain central limit theorems for these Diophantine statistics in both classical and fractal settings.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables. Submitted for publication. Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A well-studied statistic of an integer partition is the size of its Durfee square. In particular, the number $D_k (n)$ of partitions of $n$ with Durfee square of fixed size $k$ has a well-known simple rational generating function. We study the number $R_k (n)$ of partitions of $n$ with Durfee triangle of size $k$ (the largest subpartition with parts $1, 2, \ldots, k$). We determine the corresponding generating functions which are rational functions of a similar form. Moreover, we explicitly determine the leading asymptotic of $R_k (n)$, as $n \rightarrow \infty$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this short note we expand on recent results on the degenerate principle series $I(s,\chi)$ of classical groups associated to $s\in \mathbb{C}$ and a quadratic character $\chi$. In particular, we strengthen the result for $s\in \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$, which allows us to give as a corollary a new proof of the Howe duality conjecture for symplectic-orthogonal and unitary pairs.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Several arguments were refined. Appendix F was added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The local intertwining relation is an identity that gives precise information about the action of normalized intertwining operators on parabolically induced representations. We prove several instances of the local intertwining relation for quasi-split classical groups and the twisted general linear group, as they are required in the inductive proof of the endoscopic classification for quasi-split classical groups due to Arthur and Mok. In addition, we construct the co-tempered local $A$-packets by Aubert duality and verify their key properties by purely local means, which provide the seed cases needed as an input to the inductive proof. Together with further technical results that we establish, this makes the endoscopic classification conditional only on the validity of the twisted weighted fundamental lemma.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages, 0 figures, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a field $\mathbb{F}$, what are all functions $f \colon \mathbb{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ that satisfy the functional equation $f \left( (x+y)/(x-y) \right) = (f(x) + f(y))/(f(x) - f(y))$ for all $ x \neq y$ in $\mathbb{F}$? We solve this problem for the fields $\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}$, and a class of its subfields that includes the real constructible numbers, the real algebraic numbers, and all quadratic number fields. We also solve it over the complex numbers and on any subfield of $\mathbb{R}$, if $f$ is continuous over the reals. The proofs involve a mix of algebra in all fields, analysis over the real line, and some topology in the complex plane.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish the meromorphic continuation of certain multiple zeta functions of generalized Hurwitz type. From this meromorphic continuation, we obtain explicit formulas for their (derivative) values at nonpositive integers along a given direction. As an application, we provide explicit formulas for some values and derivative values of the Witten zeta functions $\zeta_{\mathfrak{g}_2}$ and $\zeta_{\mathfrak{so}(5)}$. Furthermore, by employing a Meinardus-type theorem, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the number of $n$-dimensional representations of the exceptional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 36 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>One construction of the Alexander polynomial is as a quantum invariant associated with representations of restricted quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at a fourth root of unity. We generalize this construction to define a link invariant $\Delta_{\mathfrak{g}}$ for any semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of rank $n$, taking values in $n$-variable Laurent polynomials. Focusing on the case $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_3$, we establish a direct relation between $\Delta_{\mathfrak{sl}_3}$ and the Alexander polynomial. We show that certain parameter evaluations of $\Delta_{\mathfrak{sl}_3}$ recover the Alexander polynomial on knots, despite the $R$-matrix not satisfying the Alexander-Conway skein relation at these points. We tabulate $\Delta_{\mathfrak{sl}_3}$ for all knots up to seven crossings and various other examples, including the Kinoshita-Terasaka knot and Conway knot mutant pair which are distinguished by this invariant.</p></details>

By utilizing this result, we show the validity of the Wakamatsu tilting conjecture for R in two cases: when R is a left Artinian local ring or when it is the group ring of a finite group G over a commutative Artinian ring.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we generalize the Tits construction for Lie superalgebras such that $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ acts by even derivations and decompose, as $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-module, into a direct sum of copies of the adjoint, the natural and the trivial representations. This construction generalizes the one provided by Elduque et al in \cite{EBCC23}, and it is possible to described the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-Lie superstructure in terms of $\mathcal{J}$-ternary superalgebras as a super version of the defined by Allison. We extend the Tits-Kantor-Koecher construction and the Tits-Allison-Gao functor that define a short $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-Lie superalgebra from a $\mathcal{J}$-ternary superalgebra $(\mathcal{J},\mathcal{M})$. Our setting includes and generalizes both \cite{EBCC23} and Shang's \cite{S22}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this note, we present examples showing that several natural ways of constructing lattices from error-correcting codes do not in general yield a correspondence between minimum-weight non-zero codewords and shortest non-zero lattice vectors. From these examples, we conclude that the main results in two works of Vl\u{a}du\c{t} (Moscow J. Comb. Number Th., 2019 and Discrete Comput. Geom., 2021) on constructing lattices with exponential kissing number from error-correcting codes are invalid. A more recent preprint (arXiv, 2024) that Vl\u{a}du\c{t} posted after an initial version of this work was made public is also invalid. Exhibiting a family of lattices with exponential kissing number therefore remains an open problem (as of July 2025).</p></details>

> **Comment:** 29 pages; v3: accepted for publication in special volume on Advances in Complex Lagrangians, Integrable Systems, and Quantization

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We explore a strong categorical correspondence between isomorphism classes of sheaves of arbitrary rank on a given algebraic curve and twisted pairs on another algebraic curve, mostly from a linear-algebraic standpoint. In a particular application, we realize a generic elliptic curve as a spectral cover of the complex projective line $\mathbb{P}^1$ and then construct examples of cyclic pairs and co-Higgs bundles over $\mathbb{P}^1$. By appealing to a composite push-pull projection formula, we conjecture an iterated version of spectral correspondence. We prove this conjecture for a particular class of spectral covers of $\mathbb {P}^1$ through Galois-theoretic arguments. The proof relies upon a classification of Galois groups into primitive and imprimitive types. In this context, we revisit a classical theorem of Ritt.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An abelian variety $A/K$ is heavenly at $\ell$ if the extension $K(A[\ell^{\infty}])/K(\mu_{\ell^{\infty}}\!)$ is both pro-$\ell$ and unramified away from $\ell$. It is known that for a fixed quadratic field $K$, the number of $K$-isomorphism classes of heavenly elliptic curves is finite, even running over all primes $\ell$. We prove a complementary result, that for a fixed prime $\ell \geq 7$, there are only finitely many such classes, even running over all quadratic fields. We demonstrate similar behavior between heavenly elliptic curves and elliptic curves with complex multiplication, in terms of Frobenius traces modulo $\ell$. We conjecture a stronger finiteness statement based on these new results. Finally, we produce an explicit list of elliptic curves with irrational $j$-invariants that contains all heavenly elliptic curves with complex multiplication defined over quadratic fields, supported by overwhelming computational evidence that every curve on the list is heavenly.

> **Comment:** 42 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Jiang and Rallis (1997) defined a family of local integrals attached to a cubic polynomial and proved explicit evaluations of them over a non-archimedean local field $F$, when either $F$ contains three third roots of unity, or the defining polynomial is reducible. The restriction on $F$ allowed them, among other things, to reduce the case of irreducible polynomials of the form $x^3-a$. Pleso (2009) began the work of removing the restriction on $F$ by expressing the integral as a sum of $16$ integrals for the cubic polynomial $x^3 - b x - c$ with $b,c\in F$, and computing nine of them. In this work, we compute $15$ of Pleso's integrals, and reduce the last to an elementary assertion about the number of points on a surface over a finite field, in the special case when $F$ is the $p$-adic numbers, $F=\mathbb{Q}_p$, and $p$ is equivalent to $5$ mod $6$. Our computations essentially complete Pleso's work in that special case. In the interim, Xiong (2020) has computed the integrals for an arbitrary non-archimedean local field by a totally different approach. Our direct approach might be more extendable to analogous integrals defined using quintic polynomials, in a higher-rank setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of a Young generating function for a probability measure on integer partitions. We use this object to characterize probability distributions over integer partitions satisfying a law of large numbers and those that satisfy a central limit theorem. We further establish a multilevel central limit theorem, which enables the study of random standard Young tableaux. As applications of these results, we describe the fluctuations of height functions associated with (i) the Plancherel growth process, (ii) random standard Young tableaux of fixed shape, and (iii) probability distributions induced by extreme characters of the infinite symmetric group $S_\infty$. In all cases, we identify the limiting fluctuations as a conditioned Gaussian Free Field.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) are used to generate secret keys in stream cipher cryptosystems. There are different kinds of key-stream generators like filter generators, combination generators, clock-controlled generators, etc. For a combination generator, the connection polynomial is the product of the connection polynomials of constituent LFSRs. For better cryptographic properties, the connection polynomials of the constituent LFSRs should be primitive with coprime degrees. The cryptographic systems using LFSRs as their components are vulnerable to correlation attacks. The attack heavily depends on the $t$-nomial multiples of the connection polynomial for small values of $t$. In 2005, Maitra, Gupta, and Venkateswarlu provided a lower bound for the number of $t$-nomial multiples of the product of primitive polynomials over GF(2). The lower bound is exact when $t=3$. In this article, we provide the exact number of $4$-nomial and $5$-nomial multiples of the product of primitive polynomials. This helps us to choose a more suitable connection polynomial to resist the correlation attacks. Next, we disprove a conjecture by Maitra, Gupta, and Venkateswarlu.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cases of Shimura varieties where the special fibre of a Rapoport-Zink space is simply the union of classical Deligne-Lusztig varieties are known as fully Hodge-Newton decomposable ones, and have been studied with great interest in the past. In recent times, the focus has shifted to identify tractable cases beyond the fully Hodge-Newton decomposable ones, and several instances have been identified where only products of classical Deligne-Lusztig varities with simpler spaces occur. In our paper, we provide a uniform framework to capture these phenomena. By studying liftings from the affine flag variety to the loop group and combining them with the Deligne-Lusztig reduction method, our main result is a powerful criterion to show that an affine Deligne-Lusztig variety is the product of a classical Deligne-Lusztig variety with affine spaces and pointed affine spaces. We introduce the class of elements that we call having geometric Coxeter type, strictly including previously studied notions such as positive Coxeter type or finite Coxeter type. These elements of geometric Coxeter type satisfy the conditions for our main result and also a condition on the Newton stratification introduced by Mili\'cevi\'c-Viehmann.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we focus on calculating a specific class of Berndt integrals, which exclusively involves (hyperbolic) cosine functions. Initially, this integral is transformed into a Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum via contour integration. Subsequently, a function incorporating theta is defined. By employing the residue theorem, the mixed Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum with both hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine in the denominator is converted into a simpler Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum, which contains only hyperbolic cosine or hyperbolic sine in the denominator. The simpler Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum is then evaluated using Jacobi elliptic functions, Fourier series expansions, and Maclaurin series expansions. Ultimately, the result is expressed as a rational polynomial of Gamma and \sqrt{pi}.Additionally, the integral is related to the Barnes multiple zeta function, which provides an alternative method for its calculation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work we study, in greater detail than before, J.H. Conway's topographs for integral binary quadratic forms. These are trees in the plane with regions labeled by integers following a simple pattern. Each topograph can display the values of a single form, or represent an equivalence class of forms. We give a new treatment of reduction of forms to canonical equivalence class representatives by employing topographs and a novel continued fraction for complex numbers. This allows uniform reduction for any positive, negative, square or non-square discriminant. Topograph geometry also provides new class number formulas, and short proofs of results of Gauss relating to sums of three squares. Generalizations of the series of Hurwitz for class numbers give evaluations of certain infinite series, summed over the regions or edges of a topograph.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by categorical representation theory, we define the wiggly complex, whose vertices are arcs wiggling around $n+2$ points on a line, and whose faces are sets of wiggly arcs which are pairwise pointed and non-crossing. The wiggly complex is a $(2n-1)$-dimensional pseudomanifold, whose facets are wiggly pseudotriangulations. We show that wiggly pseudotriangulations are in bijection with wiggly permutations, which are permutations of $[2n]$ avoiding the patterns $(2j-1) \cdots i \cdots (2j)$ for $i < 2j-1$ and $(2j) \cdots k \cdots (2j-1)$ for $k > 2j$. These permutations define the wiggly lattice, an induced sublattice of the weak order. We then prove that the wiggly complex is isomorphic to the boundary complex of the polar of the wigglyhedron, for which we give explicit and simple vertex and facet descriptions. Interestingly, we observe that any Cambrian associahedron is normally equivalent to a well-chosen face of the wigglyhedron. Finally, we recall the correspondence of wiggly arcs with objects in a category, and we develop categorical criteria for a subset of wiggly arcs to form a face of the wiggly complex.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a finite abelian group written multiplicatively, with $\hat{G} = G\sqcup \{0\}$ the pointed abelian group formed by adjoining an absorbing element $0$. There is an associated finitary, proto-abelian category $\mathrm{Vect}_{\hat{G}}$, whose objects can be thought of as finite-dimensional vector spaces over $\hat{G}$. The class of $\hat{G}$-linear monoids are then defined in terms of this category. In this paper, we study the finitary, proto-abelian category $\mathrm{Rep}(M,\hat{G})$ of finite-dimensional $\hat{G}$-linear representations of a $\hat{G}$-linear monoid $M$. Although this category is only a slight modification of the usual category of $M$-modules, it exhibits significantly different behavior for interesting classes of monoids. Assuming that the regular principal factors of $M$ are objects of $\mathrm{Rep}(M,\hat{G})$, we develop a version of the Clifford-Munn-Ponizovski\u i Theorem and classify the $M$ for which each non-zero object of $\mathrm{Rep}(M,\hat{G})$ is a direct sum of simple objects. When $M$ is the endomorphism monoid of an object in $\mathrm{Vect}_{\hat{G}}$, we discuss alternate frameworks for studying its $\hat{G}$-linear representations and contrast the various approaches.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present the Enhanced Multidimensional Chaotic Heuristic Sieve (EMCHS), a novel probabilistic framework that integrates chaotic perturbations and random matrix theory (RMT) to suggest improved bounds on prime gaps. Building upon the foundational sieves of Goldston-Pintz-Yildirim and Maynard, EMCHS heuristically suggests unconditional gaps of at most 180 and conditional gaps of at most 8 under a partial Elliott-Halberstam conjecture (EHC) with delta = 0.3. These heuristic suggestions surpass Maynard's unconditional bound of 246 through refined polytope optimizations and probabilistic enhancements. We provide rigorous proofs for certain analytic components (such as bounding chaotic perturbations via ergodic theory) and explicitly distinguish which arguments and conclusions are heuristic or conjectural. Numerical evidence for primes up to 10^18 supports the framework, and we discuss limitations and avenues for future rigorous work.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Consider $(G, V)$ a finite-dimensional representation of a connected reductive complex Lie group $G$ and $\mathbb{P}\left( V\right) $ the projective space of $V$. Denote by $G'$ the derived subgroup of $G$ and assume that the categorical quotient is one dimensional. In the case where the representation $(G, V)$ is also multiplicity-free, it is known from Howe-Umeda [4] that the algebra of $G$-invariant differential operators $\Gamma\left(V, \mathcal{D}_V\right)^G$ is a commutative polynomial ring. Suppose that the representation $(G, V)$ satisfies the abstract Capelli condition: $(G, V)$ is an irreducible multiplicity-free representation such that the Weyl algebra $\Gamma\left(V, \mathcal{D}_V\right)^G$ is equal to the image of the center of the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathrm{Lie}(G)$ under the differential $\tau: \mathrm{Lie}(G) \longrightarrow \Gamma\left(V, \mathcal{D}_V\right)$ of the $G$-action. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the quotient algebra of all $G'$-invariant differential operators by those vanishing on $G'$-invariant polynomials. The main aim of this paper is to prove that there is an equivalence of categories between the category of regular holonomic $\mathcal{D}_{\mathbb{P}\left( V\right)}$-modules on the complex projective space $\mathbb{P}\left( V\right) $ and the quotient category of finitely generated graded $\mathcal{A}$-modules modulo those supported by $\left\{ 0\right\} $. This result is a generalization of [12, Theorem 3.4] and of [13, Theorem 8]. As an application we give an algebraic/combinatorial classification of regular holonomic $\mathcal{D}_{\mathbb{P}\left( V\right) }$-modules on the projective space of skew-symmetric matrices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent years, significant progress has been made on Mazur's Program B, with many authors beginning a systematic classification of all possible images of $p$-adic Galois representations attached to elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$. Currently, the classification is only complete for $p \in \{2,3,13,17\}$. The main difficulty for other primes arises from the need to understand elliptic curves whose mod-$p^n$ Galois representations are contained in the normaliser of a non-split Cartan subgroup. Equivalently, this amounts to determining the rational points on the modular curves $X_{ns}^+(p^n)$. Here, we consider the case $p=7$ and show that the modular curve $X_{ns}^+(49)$, of genus 69, has no non-CM rational points. To achieve this, we establish a correspondence between the rational points on $X_{ns}^+(49)$ and the primitive integer solutions of the generalised Fermat equation $a^2 + 28b^3 = 27 c^7$, the resolution of which can be reduced to determining the rational points of several genus-three curves. Furthermore, we reduce the complete classification of $7$-adic images to the determination of the rational points of a single plane quartic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2015, Van den Bergh showed that complete 3-Calabi-Yau algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 are equivalent to Ginzburg dg algebras associated with quivers with potential. He also proved the natural generalisation to higher dimensions and non-algebraically closed ground fields. The relative version of the notion of Ginzburg dg algebra is that of Ginzburg morphism. For example, every ice quiver with potential gives rise to a Ginzburg morphism. We generalise Van den Bergh's theorem by showing that, under suitable assumptions, any morphism with a relative Calabi-Yau structure is equivalent to a Ginzburg(-Lazaroiu) morphism. In particular, in dimension 3 and over an algebraically closed ground field of characteristic 0, it is given by an ice quiver with potential. Thanks to the work of Bozec-Calaque-Scherotzke, this result can also be viewed as a non-commutative analogue of Joyce-Safronov's Lagrangian neighbourhood theorem in derived symplectic geometry.</p></details>

In this article, we use the stacky perspective on prismatic cohomology, due to Drinfeld and Bhatt--Lurie, to give a version of this comparison result with coefficients in a perfect complex of prismatic $F$-crystals on $X$. Our method is of an integral nature and suggests new tools to understand the relationship between torsion in de Rham and crystalline cohomology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop an obstruction theory for the extension of truncated minimal $A$-infinity bimodule structures over truncated minimal $A$-infinity algebras. Obstructions live in far-away pages of a (truncated) fringed spectral sequence of Bousfield--Kan type. The second page of this spectral sequence is mostly given by a new cohomology theory associated to a pair consisting of a graded algebra and a graded bimodule over it. This new cohomology theory fits in a long exact sequence involving the Hochschild cohomology of the algebra and the self-extensions of the bimodule. We show that the second differential of this spectral sequence is given by the Gerstenhaber bracket with a bimodule analogue of the universal Massey product of a minimal $A$-infinity algebra. We also develop a closely-related obstruction theory for truncated minimal $A$-infinity bimodule structures over (the truncation of) a fixed minimal $A$-infinity algebra; the second page of the corresponding spectral sequence is now mostly given by the vector spaces of self-extensions of the underlying graded bimodule and the second differential is described analogously to the previous one. We also establish variants of the above for graded algebras and graded bimodules that are $d$-sparse, that is they are concentrated in degrees that are multiples of a fixed integer $d\geq1$. These obstruction theories are used to establish intrinsic formality and almost formality theorems for differential graded bimodules over differential graded algebras. Our results hold, more generally, in the context of graded operads with multiplication equipped with an associative operadic ideal, examples of which are the endomorphism operad of a graded algebra and the linear endomorphism operad of a pair consisting of a graded algebra and a graded bimodule over it.</p></details>

As the latter is verified for general Shimura varieties by Pan and Camargo, we obtain the perfectoidness of every completed stalk of general Shimura varieties at infinite level at $p$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\rho: \Gamma \to G$ be an Anosov representation, with $\Gamma$ a word hyperbolic group and $G$ a semisimple Lie group. Previous works (by Guichard--Wienhard, Kapovich--Leeb--Porti, and recently Carvajales--Stecker) constructed an open domain of discontinuity $\Omega_\rho \subset G/H$, where $H$ is a parabolic or symmetric subgroup. In this paper, we extend the properly discontinuous $\Gamma$-action (via $\rho$) to the space of connections on the pullback of the tangent bundle over $\Omega_\rho$. When $\Omega_\rho$ is a complex surface, we show that the $\Gamma$-action is properly discontinuous on the union of the Higgs bundle structures of the $(1,0)$ part of the complexification of these pullback bundles. We further construct a topological free group $F$ generated by these holomorphic line bundles and show that $\rho(\Gamma)$ acts properly discontinuously on $F \setminus \{\mathrm{id}\}$. This free group is shown to be well-defined up to isomorphism over the character variety of Zariski dense Anosov representations. Finally, we endow the space of Anosov representations with a categorical structure and construct a natural functor to the category of free groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444.</p></details>

This extends the construction of arXiv:1601.03586 (where it was assumed that ${\mathbf M}={\mathbf N}\oplus{\mathbf N}^*$ for some representation $\mathbf N$ of $G$). Our construction goes through certain "universal" ring object in the twisted derived Satake category of the symplectic group $Sp(2n)$. The construction of this object uses a categorical version of the Weil representation; we also compute the image of this object under the (twisted) derived Satake equivalence and show that it can be obtained from the theta-sheaf introduced by S.Lysenko on $\mathrm{Bun}_{Sp(2n)}({\mathbb P}^1)$ via certain Radon transform. We also discuss applications of our construction to a potential mathematical construction of $S$-duality for super-symmetric boundary conditions in 4-dimensional gauge theory and to (some extension of) the conjectures of D.Ben-Zvi, Y.Sakellaridis and A.Venkatesh.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that a vector space valued TQFT constructed in work of De Renzi et al. [DGGPR23] extends naturally to a topological field theory which takes values in the symmetric monoidal category of linear cochains. Specifically, we consider a bordism category whose objects are surfaces with markings from the category of cochains Ch(A) over a given modular tensor category (such as the category of small quantum group representations), and whose morphisms are 3-dimensional bordisms with embedded ribbon graphs traveling between such marked surfaces. We construct a symmetric monoidal functor from the aforementioned ribbon bordism category to the category of linear cochains. The values of this theory on surfaces are identified with Hom complexes for Ch(A), and the 3-manifold invariants are alternating sums of the renormalized Lyubashenko invariant from [DGGPR23]. We show that our cochain valued TQFT furthermore preserves homotopies, and hence localizes to a theory which takes values in the derived $\infty$-category of dg vector spaces. The domain for this $\infty$-categorical theory is, up to some approximation, an $\infty$-category of ribbon bordism with labels in the homotopy $\infty$-category K(A). We suggest our localized theory as a starting point for the construction of a "derived TQFT" for the $\infty$-category of derived quantum group representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let R be a commutative Noetherian local ring. We give a characterization of when the completion of R has an isolated singularity. This result simultaneously improves a theorem of Dao and Takahashi and a theorem of Bahlekeh, Hakimian, Salarian, and Takahashi. As an application, we strengthen the Auslander-Huneke-Leuschke-Wiegand theorem in the form refined by Dao and Takahashi. We further investigate the ascent and descent of finite and countable syzygy representation type along the canonical map from R to its completion. As a consequence, we obtain a complete affirmative answer to Schreyer's conjecture. We also explore analogues of Chen's questions in the context of finite Cohen-Macaulay representation type over Cohen-Macaulay rings. The main result in this direction shows that if R is Cohen-Macaulay and there are only finitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules that are locally free on the punctured spectrum, then either R is a hypersurface or every Gorenstein projective module is projective, and every Gorenstein projective module over the completion of R is a direct sum of finitely generated ones. Finally, we study dominant local rings, introduced by Takahashi, under certain finite representation type conditions, and identify a new class of virtually Gorenstein rings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $S_k$ denote the space of cusp forms of weight $k$ and level one. For $0\leq t\leq k-2$ and primitive Dirichlet character $\chi$ mod $D$, we introduce twisted periods $r_{t,\chi}$ on $S_k$. We show that for a fixed natural number $n$, if $k$ is sufficiently large relative to $n$ and $D$, then any $n$ periods with the same twist but different indices are linearly independent. We also prove that if $k$ is sufficiently large relative to $D$ then any $n$ periods with the same index but different twists mod $D$ are linearly independent. These results are achieved by studying the trace of the products and Rankin-Cohen brackets of Eisenstein series of level $D$ with nebentypus. Moreover, we give two applications of our method. First, we prove certain identities that evaluate convolution sums of twisted divisor functions. Second, we show that Maeda's conjecture implies a non-vanishing result on twisted central $L$-values of normalized Hecke eigenforms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Markov numbers, i.e. positive integers appearing in solutions to $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz$, can be viewed as specializations of cluster variables. The second author and Matsushita gave a generalization of the Markov equation, $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k_1yz + k_2xz + k_3xy = (3+k_1+k_2+k_3)xyz$, whose solutions can be viewed as specializations of cluster variables in generalized cluster algebras. We give two families of matrices in $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}[x_1^\pm,x_2^\pm,x_3^\pm])$ associated to these cluster structures. These matrix formulas relate to previous matrices appearing in the context of Markov numbers, including Cohn matrices and generalized Cohn matrices given by the second author, Maruyama, and Sato, as well as matrices appearing in the context of cluster algebras, including matrix formulas given by Kanatarc{\i} O\u{g}uz and Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m. We provide a classification of the two families of matrices and exhibit an explicit family of each. The latter is done by realizing cluster variables in generalized Markov cluster algebras as weight-generating functions of order ideals in certain fence posets which are related to Christoffel words. An interesting observation is that these functions resemble Caldero-Chapoton functions for string modules, and a byproduct of our proofs is a new skein-like formula for such functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a possibly twisted loop group $LG$, and any character sheaf of its Iwahori subgroup, we identify the associated affine Hecke category with a combinatorial category of Soergel bimodules. In fact, we prove such results for affine Hecke categories arising from central extensions of the loop group $LG$. Our results work for mod $\ell$ or integral $\ell$-adic coefficients. As applications, we obtain endoscopic equivalences between affine Hecke categories, including the derived Satake equivalence for metaplectic groups, and a series of conjectures by Gaitsgory in quantum geometric Langlands.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The signs of Fourier coefficients of certain eta quotients are determined by dissecting expansions for theta functions and by applying a general dissection formula for certain classes of quintuple products. A characterization is given for the coefficient sign patterns for $$ \frac{(q^i;q^i)_{\infty}}{(q^p;q^p)_{\infty}} $$ for integers \( i > 1 \) and primes \( p > 3 \). The sign analysis for this quotient addresses and extends a conjecture of Bringmann et al. for the coefficients of \( (q^2;q^2)_{\infty}(q^5;q^5)_{\infty}^{-1} \). The sign distribution for additional classes of eta quotients is considered. This addresses multiple conjectures posed by Bringmann et al.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate trace and observability inequalities for Laplace eigenfunctions on the d-dimensional torus, with respect to arbitrary Borel measures $\mu$. Specifically, we characterize the measures $\mu$ for which the inequalities $$ \int |u|^2 d \mu \lesssim \int |u|^2 d x \quad \text{(trace)}, \qquad \int |u|^2 d \mu \gtrsim \int |u|^2 d x \quad \text{(observability)}$$ hold uniformly for all eigenfunctions $u$ of the Laplacian. Sufficient conditions are derived based on the integrability and regularity of $\mu$, while necessary conditions are formulated in terms of the dimension of the support of the measure. These results generalize classical theorems of Zygmund and Bourgain--Rudnick to higher dimensions. Applications include results in the spirit of Cantor--Lebesgue theorems, constraints on quantum limits, and control theory for the Schr\"odinger equation. Our approach combines several tools: the cluster structure of lattice points on spheres; decoupling estimates; and the construction of eigenfunctions exhibiting strong concentration or vanishing behavior, tailored respectively to the trace and observability inequalities.</p></details>
