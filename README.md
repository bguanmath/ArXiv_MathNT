### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14118v1'>2507.14118</a>\]&nbsp; **Multiple $\wp$-Functions and Their Applications**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hayato Kanno, Katsumi Kina &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce and study multiple $\wp$-functions, which generalize the classical Weierstrass $\wp$-function to iterated sums over lattice points, and we establish explicit formulas expressing them in terms of single $\wp$-functions with coefficients given by multiple Eisenstein series. As an application, we derive some relations among multiple Eisenstein series and multiple zeta values by exploiting the double periodicity of the multiple $\wp$-functions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sulakhana Chowdhury, Geetha Thangavelu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we construct the permutation modules and Young modules for Brauer algebras of type $C$ by extending the representation theory of the group algebra of hyperoctahedral groups. Additionally, we develop a stratifying system for Brauer algebras of type $C$, thereby extending the work of Hemmer-Nakano in \cite{HN} on Hecke algebras. This framework allows us to determine when the multiplicities of cell modules in any filtration are well-defined. As a result, we prove that if the characteristic of the field is neither $2$ nor $3$, then every permutation module of the Brauer algebra of type $C$ decomposes into a direct sum of indecomposable Young modules. We also establish certain cohomological criteria for the group algebra of the hyperoctahedral groups, which are necessary to prove the results for the Brauer algebras of type $C$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gaston Burrull, Nicolas Libedinsky, Rodrigo Villegas &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study Bruhat intervals in affine Weyl groups by viewing them as regions of alcoves. In type $\widetilde{A}_2$ we show that each interval coincides with a generalized permutohedron minus a star-shaped polygon, and we prove a subtler version inside the dominant chamber of type $\widetilde{A}_n$. Motivated by this geometry, we conjecture that whenever two Bruhat intervals are isomorphic, there exists an isomorphism realized by a piecewise isometry. We prove this when both endpoints are dominant in $\widetilde{A}_2$ and obtain partial results in $\widetilde{A}_n$. In the course of proving these results, we made the surprising observation that much of the information contained in a Bruhat interval is already encoded in a tiny portion of it.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 27 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>What might a combinatorial interpretation of the Kronecker coefficients even look like? We introduce a class of combinatorial objects called bitableaux, which we believe are a natural candidate, and we formulate a purely combinatorial problem which if resolved would give a combinatorial interpretation of the Kronecker coefficients. We make some partial progress on this problem -- enough to extract a combinatorial expansion for a Kronecker product of Schur functions in the monomial basis. We also explain how in this framework finding a combinatorial interpretation for Kronecker coefficients can be thought of as looking for a generalization of the RSK and dual RSK insertion algorithms.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Shoma Sugimoto &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 8 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the spirit of arXiv:2501.12985, we propose an abelian categorification of $\hat{Z}$-invariants for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds. It provides a blueprint for the expected dictionary between these $3$-manifolds and log VOAs; that is, the contribution from 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory via 3d-3d correspondence is recursively binary encoded in the abelian category of modules over the hypothetical log VOA, and is decoded by the recursive application of the theory of Feigin--Tipunin construction. In particular, the nested Weyl-type character formulas provide generalized characters reconstructing $\hat{Z}$. Our theory also implies vast extensions of W-algebras in a new direction.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>To the symmetric space of the (positive half) of a real loop group, we attach a Borel--Serre type bordification and equip it with a Hausdorff topology. The attached boundary, indexed by certain rational parabolics of the loop group, is shown to be homotopic to an affine, rational Tits building. A loop analogue of an arithmetic group is also shown to act continuously on the bordification and its quotient by this action is studied using the reduction theory of H. Garland. While the quotient is no longer compact (as in the Borel--Serre construction from finite-dimensions) we relate the non-compactness to the center of the loop group. We also introduce a notion of semi-stability for loop groups, following works of Harder--Narasimhan, Behrend, and most recently Chaudouard, and use this to describe a partition of our loop symmetric space. This partition is then related to the rational bordification and its quotient.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Judith Marquardt &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 33 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a gentle algebra. For every collection of string and band diagrammes, we consider the constructible subset of the variety of representations containing all modules with this underlying diagramme. We study degenerations of such sets. We show that these sets are defined by vectors of integers which we call $h$-vectors and which are related to a restricted version of the hom-order. We provide combinatorial criteria for the existence of a degeneration, involving the removal of an arrow or the resolving of a type of configuration called "reaching".</p></details>

> **Comment:** Comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a compatibility between parabolic restriction of Whittaker sheaves and restriction of representations under the geometric Casselman-Shalika equivalence. To do this, we establish various Hecke structures on geometric Eisenstein series functors, generalizing results of Braverman-Gaitsgory in the case of a principal parabolic. Moreover, we relate compactified and non-compactified geometric Eisenstein series functors via Koszul duality. We sketch a proof that the spectral-to-automorphic geometric Langlands functor commutes with constant term functors.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Approximation theorems for algebraic stacks over a number field $k$ are studied in this article. For G a connected linear algebraic group over a number field we prove strong approximation with Brauer-Manin obstruction for the classifying stack $BG$. This result answers a very concrete question, given $G$-torsors $P_v$ over $k_v$, where $v$ ranges over a finite number of places, when can you approximate the $P_v$ by a $G$-torsor $P$ defined over $k$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09190v2'>2402.09190</a>\]&nbsp; **Invariants of persistence modules defined by order-embeddings**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Claire Amiot, Thomas Brüstle, Eric J. Hanson &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** v2: improved exposition and relabeled main results as theorems. 23 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>One of the main objectives of topological data analysis is the study of discrete invariants for persistence modules, in particular when dealing with multiparameter persistence modules. In many cases, the invariants studied for these non-totally ordered posets $P$ can be obtained from restricting a given module to a subposet $X$ of $P$ that is totally ordered (or more generally, of finite representation type), and then computing the barcode (or the general direct sum decomposition) over $X$. We consider in this paper general order-preserving embeddings of representation-finite subposets $X$ into $P$ and study systematically the invariants obtained by decomposing the restriction of a given $P$-module $M$ to $X$ into its indecomposable summands. The restriction functor from $\mathrm{mod}\ P$ to $\mathrm{mod}\ X$ is well-studied, and it is known to be exact and admits both left and right adjoint functors, known as induction and co-induction functors. This allows us to obtain new homological insights, and also to re-interpret previous results. We use this approach also to determine bases of the image of these invariants, thus generalizing the concept of signed barcodes which is considered in the literature in relation to stability results. It turns out that considering only order-embeddings of one fixed poset $X$ into the poset $P$, and studying the set of all indecomposables obtained from $X$ introduces a lot of redundancy. We therefore also study iterated embeddings of several posets of increasing sizes, while limiting attention to only some indecomposables (that have not been obtained from embedding of smaller posets previously).</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ž. Baronėnas, P. Drungilas, J. Jankauskas &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We characterize all algebraic numbers $\alpha$ of degree $d\in\{4,5,6,7\}$ for which there exist four distinct algebraic conjugates $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, $\alpha_3$, $\alpha_4$ of $\alpha$ satisfying the relation $\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}=\alpha_{3}+\alpha_{4}$. In particular, we prove that an algebraic number $\alpha$ of degree 6 satisfies this relation with $\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}\notin\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if $\alpha$ is the sum of a quadratic and a cubic algebraic number. Moreover, we describe all possible Galois groups of the normal closure of $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ for such algebraic numbers $\alpha$. We also consider similar relations $\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}+\alpha_{3}+\alpha_{4}=0$ and $\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}+\alpha_{3}=\alpha_{4}$ for algebraic numbers of degree up to 7.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: Corrected the definition of the conjugate-filtered Hodge--Tate stack in the appendix. This is an edited version of part of the author's master's thesis arXiv:2409.10557 to be submitted for publication. Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use the approach to $p$-adic cohomology theories via stacks recently developed by Drinfeld and Bhatt--Lurie to formulate a stacky version of a comparison result between the Nygaard filtration on prismatic cohomology and the Hodge filtration on de Rham cohomology by Bhatt--Lurie and thereby also obtain a generalisation in the case of smooth and proper $p$-adic formal schemes which allows for coefficients in an arbitrary gauge. In the process, we develop a stacky approach to diffracted Hodge cohomology as introduced by Bhatt--Lurie which also captures the conjugate filtration and the Sen operator. In the appendix, we also introduce a stack computing the conjugate filtration on absolute Hodge--Tate cohomology.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 30 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide for a wide class of zero-free regions an upper bound for the error term in the Prime Number Theorem, refining works of Pintz (1980), Johnston (2024), and R\'ev\'esz (2024). Our method does not only apply to the Riemann zeta function, but to general Beurling zeta functions. Next we construct Beurling zeta functions having infinitely many zeros on a prescribed contour, and none to the right, for a wide class of such contours. We also deduce an oscillation result for the corresponding error term in the Prime Number Theorem, showing that our aforementioned refinement is close to being sharp.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the compatibility of the formal degree conjecture and the parabolic induction process in the simplest nontrivial case for quasi-split $p$-adic groups. For a generic discrete series $\pi$ induced from an irreducible supercuspidal $\sigma$ of a maximal Levi subgroup, we compute the quotient $d(\pi)/d(\sigma)$ of formal degrees under some assumptions. As an application, we verify the conjecture for discrete series of split $\mathrm{G}_2$ supported on maximal Levi subgroups.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jingyu Lu, Ke Ye &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 22 pages, 1 table

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical Cayley transform is a birational map between a quadratic matrix group and its Lie algebra, which was first discovered by Cayley in 1846. Because of its essential role in both pure and applied mathematics, the classical Cayley transform has been generalized from various perspectives. This paper is concerned with a representation theoretic generalization of the classical Cayley transform. The idea underlying this work is that the applicability of the classical Cayley transform heavily depends on how the Lie group is represented. The goal is to characterize irreducible representations of a Lie group, to which the classical Cayley transform is applicable. To this end, we first establish criteria of the applicability for a general Lie group. If the group is semisimple, we further obtain a geometric condition on the weight diagram of such representations. Lastly, we provide a complete classification for classical complex simple Lie groups and their compact real forms. Except for the previously known examples, spin representations of $\mathrm{Spin}(8)$ are the only ones on our list.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 33 pages; Comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the $p$-adic and $\ell$-adic monodromy operators associated with hyper-K\"ahler varieties over $p$-adic fields, in connection with Looijenga-Lunts-Verbitsky Lie algebras. We investigate a conjectural relation between the nilpotency indices of these monodromy operators on higher-degree cohomology groups and on the second cohomology, which may be viewed as an arithmetic analogue of Nagai's conjecture for degenerations of hyper-K\"ahler manifolds over a disk. We verify this arithmetic version of Nagai's conjecture for hyper-K\"ahler varieties over $p$-adic fields, assuming they belong to one of the four known deformation types. As part of our approach, we introduce a new method to analyze the $p$-adic cohomology of hyper-K\"ahler varieties via Sen's theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 65 pages. Final version accepted for publication in Publ. RIMS Kyoto Univ

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{g}_{\bar0}+\mathfrak{g}_{\bar1}$ be a basic classical Lie superalgebra over $\mathbb{C}$, and $e=e_{\theta}\in\mathfrak{g}_{\bar0}$ with $-\theta$ being a minimal root of $\mathfrak{g}$. Set $U(\mathfrak{g},e)$ to be the minimal finite $W$-superalgebras associated with the pair $(\mathfrak{g},e)$. In this paper we study the highest weight theory for $U(\mathfrak{g},e)$, introduce the Verma modules and give a complete isomorphism classification of finite-dimensional irreducible modules, via the parameter set consisting of pairs of weights and levels. Those Verma modules can be further described via parabolic induction from Whittaker modules for $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ or $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ respectively, depending on the detecting parity of $\textsf{r}:=\dim\mathfrak{g}(-1)_{\bar1}$. We then introduce and investigate the BGG category $\mathcal{O}$ for $U(\mathfrak{g},e)$, establishing highest weight theory, as a counterpart of the works for finite $W$-algebras by Brundan-Goodwin-Kleshchev and Losev, respectively. In comparison with the non-super case, the significant difference here lies in the situation when $\textsf{r}$ is odd, which is a completely new phenomenon. The difficulty and complicated computation arise from there.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A generalization of the well-known Fibonacci sequence is the $k$-Fibonacci sequence with some fixed integer $k\ge 2$. The first $k$ terms of this sequence are $0,0, \ldots, 1$, and each term afterwards is the sum of the preceding $k$ terms. In this paper, we find all Pell numbers that can be written as a product of two $k$-Fibonacci numbers. The proof of our main theorem uses lower bounds for linear forms in logarithms, properties of continued fractions, and a variation of a result of Dujella and Peth\H{o} in Diophantine approximation. This work generalizes a prior result of Alekseyev which dealt with determining the intersection of the Fibonacci and Pell sequences, a work of Ddamulira, Luca and Rakotomalala who searched for Pell numbers which are products of two Fibonacci numbers, and a result of Bravo, G\'omez, and Herrera, who found all Pell numbers appearing in the $k$-Fibonacci sequence.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Revised version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate pairs $(G,Y)$, where $G$ is a reductive algebraic group and $Y$ a purely-odd $G$-superscheme, asking when a pair corresponds to a quasi-reductive algebraic supergroup $\mathbb{G}$, that is, $\mathbb{G}_{\text{ev}}$ is isomorphic to $G$, and the quotient $\mathbb{G}\slash \mathbb{G}_{\text{ev}}$ is $G$-equivariantly isomorphic to $Y$. We prove that, if $Y$ satisfies certain conditions (basic quasi-reductive root data), then the question has a positive answer given by an existence and uniqueness theorem. The corresponding supergroups are said to be basic quasi-reductive, which can be classified, up to isogeny. We then decide the structure of connected quasi-reductive algebraic supergroups provided that: (i) the root system does not contain $0$; (ii) $\mathfrak{g}:=\text{Lie}(\mathbb{G})$ admits a non-degenerate even symmetric bilinear form. (iii) all odd reflections are invertible. Remarkably, those supergroups are exactly basic quasi-reductive supergroups of monodromy type.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As a sequel to [Duan-Shu-Yao], we introduce here a category $\mathscr{LC}$ arising from the BGG category $\mathcal{O}$ defined in [Duan-Shu-Yao] for Lie algebras of polynomial vector fields. The objects of $\mathscr{LC}$ are so-called Lie-Cartan modules which admit both Lie-module structure and compatible $R$-module structure ($R$ denotes the corresponding polynomial ring). This terminology is natural, coming from affine connections in differential geometry through which the structure sheaves in topology and the vector fields in geometry are integrated for differential manifolds. In this paper, we study Lie-Cartan modules and their categorical and cohomology properties. The category $\mathscr{LC}$ is abelian, and a ``highest weight category" with depths. Notably, the set of co-standard objects in the category $\mathcal{O}$ turns out to represent the isomorphism classes of simple objects of $\mathscr{LC}$. We then establish the cohomology for this category (called the $\mathscr{uLC}$-cohomology), extending Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology theory.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Standard prime-number counting functions, such as $\psi(x)$, $\theta(x)$, and $\pi(x)$, have error terms with limiting logarithmic distributions once suitably normalized. The same is true of weighted versions of those sums, like $\pi_r(x) = \sum_{p\le x} \frac1p$ and $\pi_\ell(x) = \sum_{p\le x} \log(1-\frac1p)^{-1}$, that were studied by Mertens. These limiting distributions are all identical, but passing to the limit loses information about how these error terms are correlated with one another. In this paper, we examine these correlations, showing, for example, that persistent inequalities between certain pairs of normalized error terms are equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis (RH). Assuming both RH and LI, the linear independence of the positive imaginary parts of the zeros of $\zeta(s)$, we calculate the logarithmic densities of the set of real numbers for which two different error terms have prescribed signs. For example, we conditionally show that $\psi(x) - x$ and $\sum_{n\le x} \frac{\Lambda(n)}n - (\log x - C_0)$ have the same sign on a set of logarithmic density $\approx 0.9865$.</p></details>

We identify this subgroup to be the Iwahori subgroup in the supersingular case, and $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Z}_p)$ in the principal series case. As an application, we relate the action of parahoric subgroups to the action of the inertia group of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbf{Q}}_p/\mathbf{Q}_p)$, and we prove that if an irreducible Banach space representation $\Pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Q}_p)$ has infinite $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Z}_p)$-length then a twist of $\Pi$ has locally algebraic vectors. This answers a question of Dospinescu. We make the simplifying assumption that $p > 3$ and that all our representations are generic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The 2-switch-degree of $G$ is the number of distinct 2-switches acting on a graph $G$. In this work we study structural properties of the 2-switch-degree, with a focus on split graphs. Our approach is motivated by the Tyshkevich decomposition, which uniquely expresses any graph as a composition $G_r \circ \ldots \circ G_1$ of irreducible graphs, where $G_2, \ldots, G_r$ are split. Our key tool is the factor graph $\Phi(S)$, a multigraph associated with a split graph $S$ that encodes 2-switch-degree information via edge multiplicities between independet vertices of $S$. By leveraging $\Phi(S)$, we reduce the problem of classifying irreducible split graphs to enumerating and analyzing unlabeled connected multigraphs of fixed size. Using this method, we fully classify irreducible split graphs of degrees 1, 2, 3, and 4. Further, we introduce and investigate the $\Delta$-property, a surprising connection between Graph Theory and Number Theory that arises from $n$-simple triangles (3-cycles with uniform edge multiplicity $n$) of the factor graph.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct and analyze the "syntomic Steenrod algebra", which acts on the mod $p$ syntomic cohomology (also known as etale-motivic cohomology) of algebraic varieties in characteristic $p$. We then apply the resulting theory to resolve the last open cases of a 1966 Conjecture of Tate, concerning the existence of a symplectic form on the Brauer groups of smooth proper surfaces over finite fields. More generally, we exhibit symplectic structure on the higher Brauer groups of even dimensional varieties over finite fields. Although the applications are classical, our methods rely on recent advances in perfectoid geometry and prismatic cohomology, which we employ to define a theory of "spectral syntomic cohomology" with coefficients in motivic spectra. We then organize the resulting cohomology theories into a category of "spectral prismatic $F$-gauges", generalizing the prismatic $F$-gauges of Drinfeld and Bhatt--Lurie, for which we establish a ``spectral Serre duality'' extending classical coherent duality. These abstract constructions are leveraged to explicitly compute the syntomic Steenrod operations.</p></details>

Among other things, we establish bounds for Frobenius eigenvalues, show a strong version of Grothendieck's local monodromy theorem, prove mixedness of the nearby cycle sheaf, and show that for any formal model, the IC sheaf on the special fiber is captured by the nearby cycles of the IC sheaf on the generic fiber. We also prove a local version of Deligne's weight-monodromy conjecture, by a novel perfectoid analysis of nearby cycles. Along the way, we develop the theory of "constructible $\ell$-adic complexes on Deligne's topos" (six operations, perverse t-structure, a notion of mixedness, etc.), which is prerequisite to a precise discussion of the Galois action on nearby cycles for algebraic and rigid analytic varieties over non-archimedean fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathsf{E}/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve. By the modularity theorem, it admits a surjection from a modular curve $X_0(N) \to \mathsf{E}$, and the minimal degree among such maps is called the modular degree of $\mathsf{E}$. By the Mordell--Weil Theorem, $\mathsf{E}(\mathbb{Q})\simeq \mathbb{Z}^r \oplus T$ for some nonnegative integer $r$ and some finite group $T$. Watkins' Conjecture predicts that $2^r$ divides the modular degree, thus suggesting an intriguing link between these geometrically- and algebraically-defined invariants. We offer some new cases of Watkins' Conjecture, specifically for elliptic curves with additive reduction at $2$, good reduction outside of at most two odd primes, and a rational point of order two.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recent advances have linked various statements involving sumsets and cardinalities with corresponding statements involving sums of random variables and entropies. In this vein, this paper shows that the quantity $2{\bf H}\{X, Y\} - {\bf H}\{X+Y\}$ is a natural entropic analogue of the additive energy $E(A,B)$ between two sets. We develop some basic theory surrounding this quantity, and demonstrate its role in the proof of Tao's entropy variant of the Balog--Szemer\'edi--Gowers theorem. We examine the regime where entropic additive energy is small, and discuss a family of random variables related to Sidon sets. In finite fields, one can define an entropic multiplicative energy as well, and we formulate sum-product-type conjectures relating these two entropic energies.</p></details>

In this paper, we give new proofs of these identities. For the non-binomial identities, we give bijective proofs using the original Andrews--Gordon and Bressoud identities as key ingredients. These proofs are based on particle motion introduced by Warnaar and extended by the first and third authors and Konan. For the binomial identities, we use the Bailey lemma and key lemmas of McLaughlin and Lovejoy, and the order in which we apply the different lemmas plays a central role in the result. We also give an alternative proof of the non-binomial identities using the Bailey lattice. With each of these proofs, new Stanton-type generalisations of classical identities arise naturally, such as generalisations of Kur\c{s}ung\"oz's analogue of Bressoud's identity with opposite parity conditions, and of the Bressoud--G\"ollnitz--Gordon identities.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the vertex functions of finite type $A$ bow varieties. Vertex functions are $K$-theoretic analogs of $I$-functions, and 3d mirror symmetry predicts that the $q$-difference equations satisfied by the vertex functions of a variety and its 3d mirror dual are the same after a change of variable swapping the roles of the various parameters. Thus the vertex functions are related by a matrix of elliptic functions, which is expected to be the elliptic stable envelope of M. Aganagic and A. Okounkov. We prove all of these statements. The strategy of our proof is to reduce to the case of cotangent bundles of complete flag varieties, for which the $q$-difference equations can be explicitly identified with Macdonald difference equations. A key ingredient in this reduction, of independent interest, involves relating vertex functions of the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety with those of a ``finer" flag variety. Our formula involves specializing certain K\"ahler parameters (also called Novikov parameters) to singularities of the vertex functions. In the $\hbar \to \infty$ limit, this statement is expected to degenerate to an analogous result about $I$-functions of flag varieties.</p></details>

An application to computing the set of isolated $j$-invariants in $\mathbb{Q}$ is also given.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by constructions from applied topology, there has been recent interest in the homological algebra of linear representations of posets, particularly in the context of homological algebra relative to non-standard exact structures. A prominent example is the spread exact structure on the category of representations of a fixed poset, in which the indecomposable projectives are the spread representations (that is, the indicator representations of convex and connected subsets). The spread-global dimension is known to be finite for finite posets and not uniformly bounded on the collection of all Cartesian products between two arbitrary finite total orders. It was conjectured in [AENY23] that the spread-global dimension is uniformly bounded on the collection of all Cartesian products between a fixed finite total order and an arbitrary finite total order. We provide a positive answer to this conjecture and, more generally, prove that the spread-global dimension is uniformly bounded on the collection of all Cartesian products between a fixed finite poset and an arbitrary finite total order. In doing so, we also establish the existence of finite spread-resolutions for finitely presented representations of arbitrary grid posets.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the asymptotic distribution of the Galois orbits of generic sequences of algebraic points of small height in a projective variety over a number field. Our main result is a generalization of Yuan's equidistribution theorem that applies to heights for which Zhang's lower bound for the essential minimum is not necessarily an equality. It extends to all projective varieties a theorem of Burgos Gil, Philippon, Rivera-Letelier and the second author for toric varieties. It also applies to sums of canonical heights for an algebraic dynamical system, and in particular it recovers K\"uhne's semiabelian equidistribution theorem. We also generalize previous work of Chambert-Loir and Thuillier to obtain new logarithmic equidistribution results. Finally we extend our main result to the quasi-projective setting recently introduced by Yuan and Zhang.</p></details>

We also describe a concrete algorithm, implementable in principle on a computer, which provably computes all maximal orbit closures which are 'atypical' in a sense described by Filip. The same methods also give a general algorithm for computing atypical special loci associated to systems of differential equations, and in particular give an effective and o-minimal free proof of the geometric Zilber-Pink conjecture for variations of mixed Hodge structures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present new techniques for removing arrows of bound quiver algebras, reducing thus the Finitistic Dimension Conjecture $\mathsf{(FDC)}$ for a given algebra to a smaller one. Unlike the classic arrow removal operation of Green-Psaroudakis-Solberg, our methods allow for removing arrows even when they occur in every generating set for the defining admissible ideal of the algebra. Our first main result establishes an equivalence for the finiteness of the finitistic (and global) dimensions of a ring $\Lambda$ and its quotient $\Lambda/K$, under specific homological and structural conditions on the ideal $K$, in the broader context of left artinian rings. The application of this result to bound quiver algebras suggests the notion of removability for sets of arrows, and we prove that successive arrow removals of this sort lead to a uniquely defined arrow reduced version of the algebra. Towards the opposite direction, we characterize generalized arrow removal algebras via removable multiplicative bimodules, and introduce trivial one-arrow extensions as a novel combinatorial construction for adding arrows while preserving the finiteness of the finitistic (and global) dimensions. All these new techniques are illustrated through various concrete bound quiver algebras, for which confirming the $\mathsf{(FDC)}$ had previously seemed intractable to the best of our knowledge.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G \leq \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ be a non-trivial finite group, acting on $R = \mathbb{C}[x_1, x_2, x_3]$. We continue our investigation from arXiv:2505.10683 [math.RT] into when the resulting skew-group algebra $R \ast G$ is a $3$-preprojective algebra of a $2$-representation infinite algebra. We consider the subgroups arising from $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{C}) \hookrightarrow \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$, called type (B), as well as the exceptional subgroups, called types (E) -- (L). For groups of type (B), we show that a $3$-preprojective structure exists on $R \ast G$ if and only if $G$ is not isomorphic to a subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ or $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$. For groups $G$ of the remaining types (E) -- (L), every $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective structure, except for type (H) and (I). To prove our results for type (B), we explore how the notion of isoclinism interacts with the shape of McKay quivers. We compute the McKay quivers in detail, using a knitting-style heuristic. For the exceptional subgroups, we compute the McKay quivers directly, as well as cuts, and we discuss how this task can be done algorithmically. This provides many new examples of $2$-representation infinite algebras, and together with arXiv:2401.10720 [math.RT], arXiv:2505.10683 [math.RT] completes the classification of finite subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ for which $R \ast G$ is a $3$-preprojective algebra.</p></details>

We show that isomorphism classes of operadic coverings of the real form $\overline{F}_n(\mathbb{R})$ are naturally one-to-one with equivalence classes of concrete coboundary monoidal categories (i.e. coboundary monoidal categories that admit a faithful monoidal functor to sets) with certain semisimplicity and finiteness conditions. Following the strategy of arXiv:1708.05105, for any complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, we recover Kashiwara $\mathfrak{g}$-crystals, as a concrete coboundary category, from the coverings given by Bethe eigenlines for inhomogeneous Gaudin models. Using this, we compute the monodromy of Bethe eigenlines for trigonometric Gaudin models over two different real loci. In the particular case of minuscule highest weights, this can be regarded as combinatorial version of the wall-crossing conjecture of Bezrukavnikov and Okounkov for quantum cohomology of symplectic resolutions in the case of minuscule resolutions of slices in the affine Grassmannian.</p></details>

We show that under the assumption of an exceptional character $\chi$ with $L(1,\chi)=o\left((\log D)^{-5}\right)$, for any $q<x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$, the asymptotic $$\psi(x,q,a)=\frac{\psi(x)}{\phi(q)}\left(1-\chi\left(\frac{aD}{(D,q)}\right)+o(1)\right)$$ holds for almost all $a$ with $(a,q)=1$.

Previous prime equidistribution results under the assumption of Siegel zeroes (by Friedlander-Iwaniec and the current author) have found that the above asymptotic holds either for all $a$ and $q$ or on average over a range of $q$ (i.e. for the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture), but only under the assumption that $q<x^{\theta}$ where $\theta=\frac{30}{59}$ or $\frac{16}{31}$, respectively.</p></details>

As a consequence, we express the Betti numbers of $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ in terms of well-known combinatorial invariants in the classical cases.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For every positive integer $m$ LeVeque (1953) defined the $U_m$-numbers as the transcendental numbers that admit very good approximation by algebraic numbers of degree $m$, but not by those of smaller degree. In these terms, Mahler's $U$-numbers are the transcendental numbers which are $U_m$ for some $m$. In 1965 Mahler showed that (properly defined) lacunary power series with integers coefficients take $U$-values at algebraic numbers, unless the value is algebraic for an obvious reason. However, his argument does not specify to which $U_m$ the value belongs. In this article, we introduce the notion of generalized Liouville series, and give a necessary and sufficient condition for their values to be $U_m$. As an application, we show that a generalized Liouville series takes a $U_m$-value at a simple algebraic integer of degree $m$, unless the value is algebraic for an obvious reason.

We show that support tau-tilting modules of a gentle algebra index a unimodular triangulation of its turbulence polyhedron. In the representation-infinite case, this triangulation is not complete and we give two different larger polyhedral dissections given by adding lower-dimensional walls to the picture. The turbulence polyhedron has a quotient map to what we define as the g-polyhedron lying in the ambient space of the g-vector fan, proving that gentle algebras are g-convex. Moreover, the images of our two types of walls under this quotient map provide two different interpretations for the complement of the g-vector fan of a gentle algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>One of the ultimate goals of the Hassett-Keel program is the determination of the log canonical models of the moduli spaces of pointed rational curves $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}$. In this paper, we study log canonical models of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,5}$ with \textit{asymmetric} boundary divisors. Our results generalize previous work by Alexeev-Swinarski, Fedorchuk-Smyth, Kiem-Moon and Simpson for the case $n=5$. We prove that all moduli spaces of weighted pointed rational curves $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,\mathcal{A}}$ arise as log canonical models of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,5}$ for suitable choices of boundary coefficients, thereby also recovering a theorem of Fedorchuk and Moon. In addition, we relate these moduli spaces to Deligne-Mostow ball quotients. We further study log canonical models of the moduli spaces $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n\cdot (1/k)}$ with symmetric weight, which differ from $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a more general version of the gluings of hyperbolic orbifolds in the spirit of Gromov and Piatetski-Shapiro, where the gluing pieces, called the building blocks, are no longer assumed to be arithmetic or incommensurable. We prove that if such a general hyperbolic gluing along a common finite-volume totally geodesic hypersurface is quasi-arithmetic (this is a broader notion than that of arithmeticity) then each building block must be quasi-arithmetic as well and, moreover, with the same ambient group and adjoint trace field. We also show that there exist arithmetic gluings whose building blocks are incommensurable even despite the reflection with respect to the lift of the gluing locus commensurates the fundamental group of the gluing. On the other hand, we provide an example of nonarithmetic but quasi-arithmetic orbifolds such that a specific gluing of such an orbifold with itself along the boundary gives rise to an arithmetic hyperbolic orbifold. We illustrate the above results in the setting of reflection groups and hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedra and apply them to rule out the (quasi-)arithmeticity of a family of ideal hyperbolic right-angled $3$-polyhedra, namely, certain ``twisted'' ideal right-angled antiprisms, which play an important role in low-dimensional geometry and topology.</p></details>

Distinct local descriptions of a (singular) point correspond to distinct choices of $X$, giving rise to a family of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs each without a Higgs branch. These local descriptions directly translate into nilpotency relations in the operator product expansions. We test our conjecture across a variety of (generalized) Argyres-Douglas (AD) theories.</p></details>

A longstanding folklore conjecture asserts that the only solutions are the ``trivial'' ones with $y=-1$. We confirm the conjecture unconditionally for $p\leq 13$, and prove the conjecture holds for $p>1831$ through a careful application of lower bounds for linear forms in two logarithms. We also show that any ``nontrivial'' solution must satisfy $y > 10^{1000}$. In addition, we establish auxiliary results that may support future progress on the problem, and we revisit prior claims in the literature regarding unresolved cases of the equation.</p></details>

Specifically, we address the factorization in two distinct settings determined by the order of vanishing of associated $L$-unctions at their central critical values-namely, the rank (1,1) and rank (0,2) cases. Our results generalize the algebraic factorization framework developed by B\"{u}y\"{u}kboduk et al. in higher rank scenario to the setting of real quadratic fields.

Using the generating function for this sequence, one can construct sequences of quasimodular forms of all nonnegative integer weights with minimal input: a weight 1 modular form and a power series $F(X)$. Using the weight 1 form $\theta(q)^2$ and $F(X)=e^{X/2}$, we obtain a sequence $\{Y_n(q)\}$ of weight $n$ quasimodular forms on $\Gamma_0(4)$ whose symmetric function avatars $\widetilde{Y}_n(\pmb{x}^k)$ are the symmetric polynomials $T_n(\pmb{x}^k)$ that arise naturally in the study of syzygies of numerical semigroups. With this information, we settle two conjectures about the $T_n(\pmb{x}^k).$ Finally, we note that these polynomials are systematically given in terms of the Borel-Hirzebruch $\widehat{A}$-genus for spin manifolds, where one identifies power sum symmetric functions $p_i$ with Pontryagin classes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a diagrammatic approach to the representation theory of the quantum symmetric pairs corresponding to orthosymplectic Lie superalgebras inside general linear Lie superalgebras. Our approach is based on the disoriented skein category, which we define as a module category over the framed HOMFLYPT skein category. The disoriented skein category admits full incarnation functors to the categories of modules over the iquantum enveloping algebras corresponding to the quantum symmetric pairs, and it can be viewed as an interpolating category for these categories of modules. We define an equivalence of module categories between the disoriented skein category and the iquantum Brauer category (also known as the $q$-Brauer category), after endowing the latter with the structure of a module category over the framed HOMFLYPT skein category. The disoriented skein category has some advantages over the iquantum Brauer category, possessing duality structure and allowing the incarnation functors to be strict morphisms of module categories. Finally, we construct explicit bases for the morphism spaces of the disoriented skein and iquantum Brauer categories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\varphi\colon R \rightarrow A$ be a finite ring homomorphism, where $R$ is a two-sided Noetherian ring, and let $M$ be a finitely generated left $A$-module. Under suitable homological conditions on $A$ over $R$, we establish a close relationship between the classical transpose of $M$ over $A$ and the Gorenstein transpose of a certain syzygy module of $M$ over $R$. As an application, for each integer $k>0$, we provide a sufficient condition under which $M$ is $k$-torsionfree over $A$ if and only if a certain syzygy of $M$ over $R$ is $k$-torsionfree over $R$, extending a result of Zhao. We introduce the notion of quasi-faithfully flat extensions and show that, under suitable assumptions, the extension closedness of the category of $k$-torsionfree modules over $R$ is equivalent to that over $A$. An application is an affirmative answer to a question posed by Zhao concerning quasi $k$-Gorensteiness, in the case where both $R$ and $A$ are Noetherian algebras. Finally, when $\varphi$ is a separable split Frobenius extension, it is proved that the category of $k$-torsionfree $R$-modules has finite representation type if and only if the same holds over $A$, with applications to skew group rings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study tensor categories that interpolate the representation categories of finite classical groups. There are (at least) two ways to approach these categories: via ultraproducts and via oligomorphic groups. Both have strengths and weaknesses. The ultraproduct categories are easy to define, but their structure is not clear. On the other hand, the oligomorphic approach requires a certain kind of measure as an input, and the space of measures is not obvious. Furthermore, it is not a priori clear that the two approaches yield the same categories in general. We handle all of these issues: we determine all measures on the oligomorphic groups, and we show that the oligomorphic and ultraproduct categories agree, which gives us basic structural results about the latter. Our results rely upon (and in some sense repackage) enumerative results in finite geometry.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The transition measure is a foundational concept introduced by Sergey Kerov to represent the shape of a Young diagram as a centered probability measure on the real line. Over a period of decades the transition measure turned out to be an invaluable tool for many problems of the asymptotic representation theory of the symmetric groups. Kerov also showed how to expand this notion for a wider class of continual diagrams so that the transition measure provides a homeomorphism between a subclass of continual diagrams (having a specific support) and a class of centered probability measures with a support contained in a specific interval. We quantify the modulus of continuity of this homeomorphism. More specifically, we study the dependence of the cumulative distribution function of Kerov transition measure on the profile of a diagram at the locations where the profile is not too steep.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We derive a family of approximations for L-functions of Hecke cusp eigenforms, according to a recipe first described by Matiyasevich for the Riemann xi function. We show that these approximations converge to the true L-function and point out the role of an equidistributional notion in ensuring the approximation is well-defined, and along the way we demonstrate error formulas which may be used to investigate analytic properties of the L-function and its derivatives, such as the locations and orders of zeros. Together with the Euler product expansion of the L-function, the family of approximations also encodes some of the key features of the L-function such as its functional equation. As an example, we apply this method to the L-function of the modular discriminant and demonstrate that the approximation successfully locates zeros of the L-function on the critical line. Finally, we derive via Mellin transforms a convolution-type formula which leads to precise error bounds in terms of the incomplete gamma function. This formula can be interpreted as an alternative definition for the approximation and sheds light on Matiyasevich's procedure.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $q$ be an odd prime and $k$ be a natural number. We show that a finite subset of integers $S$ that does not contain any perfect $q^{th}$ power, contains a $q^{th}$ power residue modulo almost every natural numbers $N$ with at most $k$ prime factors if and only if $S$ corresponds to a $k$-blocking set of $\PG(\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n})$. Here, $n$ is the number of distinct primes that divides the $q$-free parts of elements of $S$. Consequently, this geometric connection enables us to utilize methods from Galois geometry to derive lower bounds for the cardinalities of such sets $S$ and to completely characterize such $S$ of the smallest and the second smallest cardinalities. Furthermore, the property of whether a finite subset of integers contains a $q^{th}$ power residue modulo almost every integer $N$ with at most $k$ prime factors is invariant under the action of projective general linear group $\mathrm{PGL}(n, q)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The global analogue of a Henselian local ring is a Henselian pair: a ring A and an ideal I which satisfy a condition resembling Hensel's lemma regarding lifting coprime factorizations of polynomials over A/I to factorizations over A. The geometric counterpart is the notion of a Henselian scheme, which is an analogue of a tubular neighborhood in algebraic geometry. In this paper we revisit the foundations of the theory of Henselian schemes. The pathological behavior of quasi-coherent sheaves on Henselian schemes in characteristic 0 makes them poor models for an "algebraic tube" in characteristic 0. We show that such problems do not arise in positive characteristic, and establish good properties for analogues of smooth and \'etale maps in the general Henselian setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The arithmetic average of the first $n$ primes, $\bar p_n = {1\over n} \sum_{i=1}^n p_i$, exhibits very many interesting and subtle properties. Since the transformation from $p_n \to \bar p_n$ is extremely easy to invert, $p_n = n\bar p_n - (n-1)\bar p_{n-1}$, it is clear that these two sequences $p_n \longleftrightarrow \bar p_n$ must ultimately carry exactly the same information. But the averaged sequence $\bar p_n$, while very closely correlated with the primes, ($\bar p_n \sim {1\over2} p_n$), is much "smoother'', and much better behaved. Using extensions of various standard results I shall demonstrate that the prime-averaged sequence $\bar p_n$ satisfies prime-averaged analogues of the Cramer, Andrica, Legendre, Oppermann, Brocard, Fourges, Firoozbakht, Nicholson, and Farhadian conjectures. (So these prime-averaged analogues are not conjectures, they are theorems.) The crucial key to enabling this pleasant behaviour is the "smoothing'' process inherent in averaging. Whereas the asymptotic behaviour of the two sequences is very closely correlated the local fluctuations are quite different.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\ell\in\{0,1,\dots,n\}$, we consider the function extracting the $\ell$th coefficient of the Ehrhart polynomials of lattice polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^n$. These functions form a basis of the space of unimodular invariant valuations. We show that, in even dimensions, these functions are in fact simultaneous symplectic Hecke eigenfunctions. We leverage this and apply the theory of spherical functions and their associated zeta functions to prove analytic, asymptotic, and combinatorial results about the arithmetic functions averaging $\ell$th Ehrhart coefficients.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(F_r M)_{r\in\mathbb{Z}}$ be a finite filtration on an object $M$ of a neutral Tannakian category $\mathbf{T}$ in characteristic zero. Let $u(M)=u^F(M)$ be the Lie algebra of the subgroup of the Tannakian fundamental group of $M$ that acts trivially on the associated graded $Gr^FM$. The filtration $F_\bullet M$ induces a filtration on the internal Hom $\underline{Hom}(M,M)$, which in turn induces a filtration $F_\bullet u(M)$ on $u(M)$. This filtration on $u(M)$ is concentrated in negative degrees. In this paper, we give a description of the graded piece $Gr^F_{-1}u( M)$ in terms of the extensions $F_{r+1}M/F_{r-1}M\in Ext^1(Gr^F_{r+1}M, Gr^F_{r}M)$. In particular, these extensions determine $Gr^F_{-1}u(M)$. Note that here we neither assume the filtration is functorial, nor we assume that $Gr^FM$ is semisimple. The problem of studying $u(M)$ in this generality is motivated by the desire to understand Tannakian groups associated to a mixed motive and its realizations, including realizations for which semisimplicity of realizations of pure motives is not known and realizations that lack an interesting functorial weight filtration. We also give two related applications. The first is an equivalent condition in the generality described above for when $u(M)$ coincides with its trivial upper bound $F_{-1}\underline{Hom}(M,M)$. This result generalizes earlier criteria for maximality of $u(M)$ obtained by various authors in special contexts or under limiting conditions. In the second application, we apply the results to the setting of a neutral Tannakian category with a functorial weight filtration $W_\bullet$. Combining the constructions of [arXiv:2307.15487] with our general maximality criterion we prove a result about the structure of the set of isomorphism classes of objects $M$ for which $Gr^WM$ is isomorphic to a given graded object $A$ and $u^W(M)=W_{-1}\underline{Hom}(M,M)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Certain foams and relations on them are introduced to interpret functors and natural transformations in categories of representations of iterated wreath products of cyclic groups of order two. We also explain how patched surfaces with defect circles and foams relate to separable field extensions and Galois theory and explore a relation between overlapping foams and Sylvester double sums. In the appendix, joint with Lev Rozansky, we compare traces in two-dimensional TQFTs coming from matrix factorizations with those in field extensions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a nonempty set $A \subset \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$, define the mask polynomial $A(X)=\sum_{a\in A} X^a$. Suppose that there are $s_1,\dots,s_k\in\nn\setminus\{1\}$ such that the cyclotomic polynomials $\Phi_{s_1},\dots,\Phi_{s_k}$ divide $A(X)$. What is the smallest possible size of $A$? For $k=1$, this was answered by Lam and Leung in 2000. Less is known about the case when $k\geq 2$; in particular, one may ask whether (similarly to the $k=1$ case) the optimal configurations have a simple ``fibered" structure on each scale involved. We prove that this is true in a number of special cases, but false in general, even if further strong structural assumptions are added. Results of this type are expected to have a broad range of applications, including Favard length of product Cantor sets, Fuglede's spectral set conjecture, and the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture on integer tilings.</p></details>
