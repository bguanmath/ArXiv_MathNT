### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03177v2'>2511.03177</a>\]&nbsp; **A Lie algebra associated with adjoint multiple zeta values**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Takumi Anzawa &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Jarossay (arXiv math.NT1412.5099) introduced adjoint multiple zeta values and, by using Racinet's dual formulation of the generating series of multiple zeta values, found $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic relations among them, referred to as the \textit{adjoint double shuffle relations}. Additionally, Jarossay defined the affine scheme $\mathrm{AdDMR}_0$ determined by the adjoint double shuffle relations and posed a question whether $\mathrm{AdDMR}_0$ is isomorphic to Racinet's double shuffle group $\mathrm{DMR}_0$ (Publ. Math. Inst. Hautes Études Sci. (2002), no. 95). In this paper, we refine Jarossay's question by introducing the condition referred to as the adjoint conditions, and, based on this refinement, we study the corresponding Lie algebraic aspect. Within this framework, we construct the Lie algebra associated with the adjoint double shuffle relations by imposing Hirose's parity results.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Elisa Bellah, Claire Dunn, Vernon Naidu, Alette Wells &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is conjectured that the Markoff equation $X^2+Y^2+Z^2=3XYZ$ satisfies the special Diophantine property that every mod $p$ solution lifts to an integer solution. Progress toward this conjecture has been made by studying the connectedness of the graphs obtained from the action of the Vieta group on the nonzero mod $p$ solutions to the Markoff equation. In this paper, we use results on Pisano periods of the Fibonacci sequence to obtain explicit results on the connectedness of special points in this graph for primes $p$ where $p+1$ has large $2$-adic valuation. In particular, for Mersenne primes $p \equiv \pm 2 \,(\text{mod}\, 5)$, we show that the special point $(1, 1, 1)$ which is fixed under reduction modulo $p$ lies in a component of this graph which is known to be connected.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 16 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we prove that for each number field $F$ there exists a uniform bound on the prime levels $p$ of elliptic curves $E/F$ for which $F(E[p])=F(ζ_p)$. Under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, we also give uniform bounds on $p$ for which $F(E[p])/F$ is abelian, provided that $F$ has no rational complex multiplication. These are generalizations of results of González-Jiménez and Lozano-Robledo to general number fields.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Stein Meereboer, Philip Schlösser &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A general theory of matrix-spherical functions for dual Hopf algebras and right coideal subalgebras is developed. We establish their existence and define their orthogonality relations. When specialized to Kolb and Letzter's quantum symmetric pair coideal subalgebras, we associate, to each classical commutative triple, a unique corresponding quantum commutative triple. This leads to families of vector-valued orthogonal polynomials, which diagonalize a commutative algebra of difference-reflection operators and are invariant under sending $q \mapsto q^{-1}$. Various examples of these vector-valued orthogonal polynomials are given and identified with Intermediate Macdonald polynomials</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Félicien Comtat &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Updated the bibliography and fixed some minor mathematical inaccuracies

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a weighted Sato-Tate law for the Satake parameters of automorphic forms on $\rm{GSp}_4$ with respect to a fairly general congruence subgroup $H$ whose level tends to infinity. When the level is squarefree we refine our result to the cuspidal spectrum. The ingredients are the $\rm{GSp}_4$ Kuznetsov formula and the explicit calculation of local integrals involved in the Whittaker coefficients of $\rm{GSp}_4$ Eisenstein series. We also discuss how the problem of bounding the continuous spectrum in the level aspect naturally leads to some combinatorial questions involving the double cosets in $P \backslash G / H$, for each parabolic subgroup $P$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be an odd prime, Jianqiang Zhao has established a curious congruence, which is $$ \sum_{i+j+k=p \atop i,j,k > 0} \frac{1}{ijk} \equiv -2B_{p-3}\pmod p , $$ where $B_{n}$ denotes the $n$-th Bernoulli number. In this paper, we will generalize this kind of sums and prove a family of similar congruences modulo prime powers $p^r$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 136 pages, comments welcome; v2: corrections and minor improvements

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a general theory of cluster categories, applying to a 2-Calabi-Yau extriangulated category $\mathcal{C}$ and cluster-tilting subcategory $\mathcal{T}$ satisfying only mild finiteness conditions. We show that the structure theory of $\mathcal{C}$ and the representation theory of $\mathcal{T}$ give rise to the rich combinatorial structures of seed data and cluster ensembles, via Grothendieck groups and homological algebra. We demonstrate that there is a natural dictionary relating cluster-tilting subcategories and their tilting theory to A-side tropical cluster combinatorics and, dually, relating modules over $\underline{\mathcal{T}}$ to the X-side; here $\underline{\mathcal{T}}$ is the image of $\mathcal{T}$ in the triangulated stable category of $\mathcal{C}$. Moreover, the exchange matrix associated to $\mathcal{T}$ arises from a natural map $p_{\mathcal{T}}\colon\mathrm{K}_0(\mathrm{mod}\underline{\mathcal{T}})\to\mathrm{K}_0(\mathcal{T})$ closely related to taking projective resolutions. Via our approach, we categorify many key identities involving mutation, g-vectors and c-vectors, including in infinite rank cases and in the presence of loops and 2-cycles. We are also able to define A- and X-cluster characters, which yield A- and X-cluster variables when there are no loops or 2-cycles, and which enable representation-theoretic proofs of cluster-theoretical statements. Continuing with the same categorical philosophy, we give a definition of a quantum cluster category, as a cluster category together with the choice of a map closely related to the adjoint of $p_{\mathcal{T}}$. Our framework enables us to show that any Hom-finite exact cluster category admits a canonical quantum structure, generalising results of Geiß--Leclerc--Schröer.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Alain Connes, Walter D. van Suijlekom &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.OA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 26 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a real distribution $\mathcal{D}$ on the interval $[0,L]$ with $\tilde{\mathcal{ D}}$ the associated even distribution on the interval $[-L, L]$, we prove that if the associated quadratic form with Schwartz kernel $\tilde{\mathcal{D}}(x - y)$ defines a lower-bounded selfadjoint operator on $L^2([-\frac{L}{2}, \frac{L}{2}])$, whose lowest spectral value $λ$ is a simple, isolated eigenvalue with even eigenfunction $ξ$, then all the zeros of the entire function $\widehat ξ(z)$, the Fourier transform of $ξ$, lie on the real line. The proof proceeds in five steps. (1) We give a C*-algebraic proof of a corollary of Carathéodory-Fejér's 1911 structure Theorem for Toeplitz matrices: if $T \in M_n(\mathbb{C})$ is a Hermitian, positive semidefinite Toeplitz matrix of rank $n - 1$, and $ξ\in \ker T$, then the polynomial $P(z) = \sum ξ_j z^j$ has all its zeros on the unit circle. (2) We formulate and prove a continuous analogue of this result, replacing the Toeplitz matrix with a convolution operator with continuous kernel $h(x - y)$, and the polynomial $P(z)$ with the Fourier transform of the eigenfunction corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. (3) We analyze finite-dimensional truncations of the quadratic forms defined by real, even distributions $\mathcal{D}$ on $[-L, L]$, and observe that the resulting matrices exhibit a structure previously encountered in perturbative expansions of the spectral action. (4) We establish an analogue of Carathéodory-Fejér's corollary for matrices of this specific structure, thereby extending the zero localization result beyond the classical Toeplitz setting. (5) Finally, we apply a classical theorem of Hurwitz concerning the zeros of uniform limits of holomorphic functions to deduce the general result stated above.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hai-Liang Wu, Yue-Feng She &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 14 pages. Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, by using the arithmetic theory of ternary quadratic forms, we study some refinements on Lagrange's four-square theorem. For example, given positive integers $a,b$ satisfying some algebraic conditions and a positive integer $C\ge3$, we will show that for any sufficiently large integer $n$ with $\ord_2(n)\le C$, there exist non-negative integers $x,y,z,w$ such that $$ \begin{cases} x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2=n, ax+by\in\mathcal{S}, \end{cases} $$ where $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of all squares over $\mathbb{Z}$. In particular, we obtain some progress on Zhi-Wei Sun's $x+24y$ conjecture.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a new quadratic Chabauty method to compute the integral points on certain even degree hyperelliptic curves. Our approach relies on a nontrivial degree zero divisor supported at the two points at infinity to restrict the $p$-adic height to a linear function; we can then express this restriction in terms of holomorphic Coleman integrals under the standard quadratic Chabauty assumption. Then we use this linear relation to extract the integral points on the curve. We also generalize our method to integral points over number fields. Our method is significantly simpler and faster than all other existing versions of the quadratic Chabauty method. We give examples over $\Q$ and $\Q(\sqrt{7})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $χ(x)\in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ be a monic polynomial whose roots are distinct integers. We study the ideal class monoid and the ideal class group of the ring $\mathbb{Z}[x]/(χ(x))$. We obtain formulas for the orders of these objects, and study their asymptotic behavior as the discriminant of $χ(x)$ tends to infinity, in analogy with the Brauer-Siegel theorem. Finally, we describe the structure of the ideal class group when the degree of $χ(x)$ is $2$ or $3$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16399v4'>2507.16399</a>\]&nbsp; **The SOS Rank of Biquadratic Forms**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Liqun Qi, Chunfeng Cui, Yi Xu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1973, Calderón proved that an $m \times 2$ positive semidefinite (psd) biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of ${3m(m+1) \over 2}$ squares of quadratic forms. Very recently, by applying Hilbert's theorem on ternary quartics, we proved that a $2 \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of three squares of bilinear forms. This improved Calderón's result for $m=2$, and left the sos (sum-of-squares) rank problem of $m \times 2$ biquadratic forms for $m \ge 3$ to further exploration. In this paper, we show that an $3 \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as four squares of bilinear forms. We make a conjecture that an $m \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as $m+1$ squares of bilinear forms.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the average shifted convolution sum $$ B(H,N):= \frac{1}{H} \sum_{h \sim H} \sum_{n \sim N} A_{π_1}(n)\, A_{π_2}(n+h), $$ where $A_{π_i}(n)$ denotes the Fourier coefficients of a Hecke--Maass cusp form $π_i$ for $SL(d_i,\mathbb{Z})$ with $d_i\ge 4$, $i=1,2$. For the cases $d_1 = d_2 + 1$ and $d_1 = d_2$, we establish a nontrivial power-saving bound of $B(H,N)$ for the range of the shift $H\ge N^{1-\frac{4}{d_1+d_2}+\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon>0$, extending beyond the results of Friedlander and Iwaniec. In particular, when $d_1 = d_2$, we reach the critical threshold $H\ge N^{1-2/d+\varepsilon}$ such that any further improvement in this range yields a subconvexity bound for the corresponding standard $L$-function in the $t$-aspect.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 14 pages, to appear in Linear Algebra and Its Applications

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Trades are important objects in combinatorial design theory that may be realized as certain elements of kernels of inclusion matrices. Total trades were introduced recently by Ghorbani, Kamali and Khosravshahi, who showed that over a field of characteristic zero the vector space of trades decomposes into a direct sum of spaces of total trades. In this paper, we show that the vector space spanned by the permutations of a total trade is an irreducible representation of the symmetric group. As a corollary, the previous decomposition theorem is recovered. Also, a basis is obtained for the module of total trades in the spirit of Specht polynomials. More generally, in the second part of the paper we consider intersection matrices and determine the irreducible decompositions of their images. This generalizes previously known results concerning ranks of special cases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a Hecke--Maass cusp form for $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$ with the Langlands parameter $μ_{F}=\big(μ_{F,1},μ_{F,2},μ_{F,3}\big)$ and the associated $L$-function $L(s, F)$. Define $S_F(t)=π^{-1}\arg L(1/2+\mathrm{i}t, F)$. When $μ_{F}$ is in generic position, we establish an unconditional asymptotic formula for the moments of $S_F(t)$. Previously, such a formula was only known to hold under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. The key ingredient is a weighted zero-density estimate in the spectral aspect for $L(s, F)$, which has recently been proved by Sun and Wang in arXiv:2412.02416.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $S(t,f)=π^{-1}\arg L(1/2+it, f)$, where $f$ is a holomorphic Hecke cusp form of weight $2$ and prime level $q$. In this paper, we establish an unconditional asymptotic formula for the moments of $S(t,f)$, providing a level aspect analogue of Selberg's classical work on $S(t)$. As a consequence, we derive a weighted central limit theorem for the distribution of $S(t,f)$ normalized by $\sqrt{\log\log q}$. To this end, we develop a precise approximation for $S(t,f)$ via a truncated Dirichlet series and employ a weighted zero-density estimate for the corresponding family of $L$-functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study abstract dynamical systems with discrete phase spaces. One example of such a system is induced by the $3 x{+}1$-map on the set of all natural numbers, also known as the Collatz map. Our main focus is on dynamical systems induced by maps on countable discrete sets that satisfy a bounded condition. When these maps satisfy the bounded and a separating conditions, a minimality of the induced dynamical systems is equivalent to the irreducibility of certain $C^{*}$-algebras on certain Hilbert spaces. For a map $f$ on a general discrete phase space, we consider $f$-invariant sets and investigate their properties. When the phase space is countable and the map satisfies the bounded condition, we construct an order-preserving injection from the family of $f$-invariant sets to the family of reducing subspaces for the corresponding $C^{*}$-algebra. By introducing the totally uniqueness condition for $f$, we show that this injection is a bijection if $f$ satisfies this condition. This condition is crucial in providing a symbolic representation of the dynamical system induced by $f$, and we discuss the relationship between this symbolic representation and that of a topological dynamical system.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a sufficient characterization for subsets $\mathcal{A}$ of the polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}_q[t]$ for which partial sums of Steinhaus random multiplicative functions approach a complex standard normal distribution. This extends recent work of Soundararajan and Xu to the function field setting. We apply this characterization to deduce central limit theorems in four cases: polynomials in short intervals, polynomials with few prime factors, shifted primes, and rough polynomials. In doing so, we also establish an explicit Hildebrand inequality for smooth polynomials in short intervals, a function field form of Shiu's theorem for multiplicative functions, and an explicit Chebyshev bound for rough polynomials in short intervals.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an odd prime $p$, we say a polynomial $f\in \mathbb F_p[X]$ computes square roots if $f(a)^2=a$ for all nonzero, perfect squares $a\in \mathbb F_p$. When $p\equiv 3 \mod 4$, it is easy to see that $f(X)=X^{\frac{p+1}{4}}$ is the smallest such polynomial. For $p\equiv 1 \mod 4$, the situation is less clear. Tonelli-Shanks offers an algorithm for constructing polynomials that compute square roots, but the question of whether their degree is minimal remains. In this paper, we study the various degrees and structures of polynomials computing square roots.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a local-global principle for representations of binary by quaternary quadratic forms. One of the main ingredients is a recent measure rigidity result of Einsiedler and Lindenstrauss for diagonalizable actions on quotients of products of $\mathrm{SL}_2$'s. Based on this, it suffices to show that limits of the uniform measures on the associated rank one adelic toral packets have more entropy than one half of the maximal entropy. The latter is proved using the Siegel mass formula and the determinant method as developed by Bombieri and Pila as well as Heath-Brown.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is well known that tau functions of the KP hierarchy satisfy addition formulas. We consider the general addition formula in the determinant form and take a certain limit of it. It expresses certain shifts of a tau function in terms of the Wronskian determinants of wave functions at various values of the spectral parameter. As an application the relation between solutions created by vertex operators and those created by Darboux transformations is clarified. As another application the new addition formula for Riemann's theta functions of Riemann surfaces is obtained by considering theta function solutions of the KP hierarchy. This addition formula is different from any of formulas in Fay's book.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Version 8 corrects Definition 5.4 (integral operator), which was ill-defined in Version 7. The regularization procedure now properly accounts for boundary identifications of the fundamental domain

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper constructs weight-shifting integral operators for Maass forms on the full modular group SL(2,Z). Under the weight parity condition t = k (mod 2), the operator utilizes an automorphic kernel constructed via Poincare series from a seed kernel. The seed kernel is defined as the product of a covariant factor and an invariant factor with respect to the diagonal action of SL(2,R). A spectral condition is imposed that the kernel must be an eigenfunction of the weight-t hyperbolic Laplacian. This problem reduces to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the invariant factor, which is identified as a Papperitz-Riemann equation. By transforming this equation into the Gauss Hypergeometric Differential Equation (HDE), the hypergeometric type of the operator is established. Analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the hypergeometric solutions yields the convergence conditions for the automorphic kernel and the integral operator, requiring the selection of the subdominant solution. The operator is defined via regularization based on the Hyperbolic Cauchy Principal Value to handle the diagonal singularities of the kernel. The automorphy of the transformed function is verified under the assumption of absolute convergence. A necessary condition for the intertwining property, namely the coincidence of the kernel's spectral parameter and the input Maass form's Laplacian eigenvalue, is conditionally derived. Analysis of the smoothness and the behavior at the cusp of the transformed function is deferred to subsequent research. Finally, the relevance of the hypergeometric structure to Hecke algebra compatibility and motivic interpretation is discussed.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>While Kronecker coefficients $g(λ,μ,ν)$ with bounded rows are polynomial-time computable via lattice-point methods, no explicit closed-form formulas have been obtained for genuinely three-row cases in the 87 years since Murnaghan's foundational work. This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse. We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge. We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \mod 2)$ for all $n \geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Admissible chains of i-boxes are important combinatorial tools in the monoidal categorification of cluster algebras, as they provide seeds of the cluster algebra. In this paper, we explore the properties of maximal commuting families of i-boxes in a more general setting, and define a certain matrix associated with such a family, which we call the exchange matrix. It turns out that, when considering the cluster algebra structure on the Grothendieck rings, this matrix is indeed the exchange matrix of the seed associated with the family, both in certain categories of modules over quantum affine algebras and over quiver Hecke algebras. We prove this by constructing explicit short exact sequences that represent the mutation relations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the Smith forms of the powers of an integer square matrix behave in an eventually periodic manner. More precisely, if $\mathrm{SF}(M)$ denotes the Smith form of $M \in \Z^{m \times m}$, then for every $A \in \Z^{m \times m}$ there exist $n_0 \in \N$, an integer $T \geq 1$, and a constant diagonal matrix $D \in \Z^{m \times m}$ such that $n \geq n_0$ implies $\mathrm{SF}(A^{n+T})=D \cdot \mathrm{SF}(A^n)$. This provides an eventually affirmative answer to a conjecture posed in 2013 by R. Bruner. We also show that both $n_0$ and $T$ can be arbitrarily large.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2019, Andrews investigated integer partitions in which all parts of a given parity are smaller than those of the opposite parity and introduced eight partition functions based on the parity of the smaller parts and parts of a given parity appearing at most once or an unlimited number of times. Recently, Bringmann, Craig and Nazaroglu studied the asymptotic behavior of the eight partition functions proved several inequalities for sufficiently large $n$. At the end of their paper, they asked for combinatorial proofs of those inequalities. In this paper, we prove that an inequality on partitions separated by parity holds for $n\geq 373$ by a combinatorial method. This answers a question posed by Bringmann, Craig and Nazaroglu.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the distribution of a sequence of points in the circle generated by rotations by a fixed irrational number $ρ$ with initial condition $x_0$, that is: $\{x_0+iρ\}_{i=1}^n$. The \emph{discrepancy} as defined by Pisot and Van Der Corput \cite{VdCP}, quantifies how evenly distributed such a sequence is. Consider the ergodic or Birkhoff sum of mean zero $S(ρ,n,x):=\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\{x+iρ\}-1/2)$, where $\{\cdot\}$ denotes the fractional part. This is a piecewise-linear map in the variable $x$ with $n$ branches, each with slope $n$. For fixed $n$ and $ρ$, let $ν(ρ,n,z)$ be the number of pre-images of $S(ρ,n,x)=z$ divided by $n$. Then $ν(ρ,n,z)$ is a probability density. We call the associated measures Birkhoff measures. We investigate how the graph of $ν(ρ,n,z)$ varies with $n$. We prove that the length of the support of the Birkhoff measure $ν(ρ,n,z)dz$ can be expressed in terms of the discrepancy. We also show that if $n$ is a continued fraction denominator of $ρ$, then the graph of $ν(ρ,n,z)$ an approximate isosceles trapezoid. We also give new, brief, proofs of two classical results, one by Ramshaw \cite{Ramshaw} and one found by Kuipers-Niederreiter \cite{KN}. These results allow efficient computation of both Birkhoff sums and discrepancies.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that $p$-primary cohomology classes of a torus $T$ over a global function field of characteristic $p$ may be split by suitable separable $p$-primary extensions. More precisely, we show that such cohomology classes will split in any ``large'' $p$-primary extension (and in fact, prove the same for $\ell$-primary classes over ``large'' $\ell$-primary extensions for every prime $\ell$, including $\ell \neq \mathrm{char}(K)$), and we prove that $p^n$-torsion classes may be split by a (solvable) separable $p$-primary extension of degree $\leq (p^n)^{1+cm\mathrm{log}(m)^3}$ for an explicitly computable universal constant $c > 0$, where $m$ is the degree of a finite Galois extension splitting the torus $T$. Along the way, we also prove Grunwald-Wang type results of independent interest which allow one to approximate a given finite list of abelian $p$-primary local extensions of places of a global function field by a suitable global extension.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 34 pages, 4 Figures, to appear in EMS series Lectures Notes in Mathematics Title : Applications of Noncommutative Geometry to Gauge Theories, Field Theories, and Quantum Space-Time

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose and investigate a strategy toward a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis based on a spectral realization of its non-trivial zeros. Our approach constructs self-adjoint operators obtained as rank-one perturbations of the spectral triple associated with the scaling operator on the interval $[λ^{-1}, λ]$. The construction only involves the Euler products over the primes $p \leq x = λ^2$ and produces self-adjoint operators whose spectra coincide, with striking numerical accuracy, with the lowest non-trivial zeros of $ζ(1/2 + i s)$, even for small values of $x$. The theoretical foundation rests on the framework introduced in "Spectral triples and zeta-cycles" (Enseign. Math. 69 (2023), no. 1-2, 93-148), together with the extension in "Quadratic Forms, Real Zeros and Echoes of the Spectral Action" (Commun. Math. Phys. (2025)) of the classical Caratheodory-Fejer theorem for Toeplitz matrices, which guarantees the necessary self-adjointness. Numerical experiments show that the spectra of the operators converge towards the zeros of $ζ(1/2 + i s)$ as the parameters $N, λ\to \infty$. A rigorous proof of this convergence would establish the Riemann Hypothesis. We further compute the regularized determinants of these operators and discuss the analytic role they play in controlling and potentially proving the above result by showing that, suitably normalized, they converge towards the Riemann $Ξ$ function.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we extend the results of Michel-Venkatesh and Hu-Michel-Nelson to establish an upper bound for triple product and Rankin-Selberg L-functions of the form $$L(π_1 \otimes π_2 \otimes π_3,\frac{1}{2})\ll_{π_3,ε}C(π_1\otimesπ_2)^{\frac{1}{2} + ε} \left( \frac{C(π_1 \otimes π_2)}{C(π_2 \otimes π_2)}\right)^{-δ}$$ in the spectral aspect, allowing conductor dropping. In particular, we obtain a subconvexity bound when $π_1\otimesπ_2$ stays uniformly away from QUE-like case. The new ingredient is a stationary phase analysis of the analytic newvectors introduced by Jana and Nelson in \cite{JN19}, for both $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{C})$, which is applied to a test vector conjecture for local triple product periods.</p></details>

To begin, we shall define our Satake groupoid, as we shall call it, as a topological groupoid, and as a special case of a general construction of Omar Mohsen. Then we shall give a Lie-theoretic account of the Satake groupoid, borrowing from work of Toshio Oshima. Finally we shall identify the Satake groupoid with the purely geometric $b$-groupoid of the Satake compactification, using the structure of the compactification as a smooth manifold with corners. In a subsequent paper we shall use the Satake groupoid to present a new proof of Harish-Chandra's principle, that all the tempered irreducible representations of $G$ may be constructed from discrete series representations using parabolic induction.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 44 pages. A new refinement of Siegel's linear independence criterion is used to correct an error pointed out by a referee and Ludovic Mistiaen. It turns out that the coefficient matrix of the linear forms we construct does not have always maximal rank: it satifies only a weaker assumption, proved to be sufficient in Siegel's linear independence criterion

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that among 1 and the odd zeta values $ζ(3)$, $ζ(5)$, \ldots, $ζ(s)$, at least $ 0.21 \sqrt{s}/\sqrt{\log s}$ are linearly independent over the rationals, for any sufficiently large odd integer $s$. This is the first asymptotic improvement on the lower bound, logarithmic in $s$, obtained by Ball-Rivoal in 2001. The proof is based on Siegel's lemma to construct non-explicit linear forms in values at odd integers of the Riemann zeta function, instead of using explicit well-poised hypergeometric series. A new refinement of Siegel's linear independence criterion is applied, together with a multiplicity estimate (namely a generalization of Shidlovsky's lemma). The result is also adapted to deal with values of the first $s$ polylogarithms at a fixed algebraic point in the unit disk, improving bounds of Rivoal and Marcovecchio.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This is a considerable extension of version 1

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a survey on the general effective reduction theory of integral polynomials and its applications. We concentrate on results providing the finiteness for the number of `$\mathbb{Z}$-equivalence classes' and `$GL_2(\mathbb{Z})$-equivalence classes' of polynomials of given discriminant. We present the effective finiteness results of Lagrange from 1773 and Hermite from 1848, 1851 for quadratic resp. cubic polynomials. Then we formulate the general ineffective finiteness result of Birch and Merriman from 1972, the general effective finiteness theorems of Győry from 1973, obtained independently, and of Evertse and Győry from 1991, and a result of Hermite from 1857 not discussed in the literature before 2023. We briefly outline our effective proofs which depend on Győry's effective results on unit equations, whose proofs involve Baker's effective theory of logarithmic forms. Then we focus on our joint paper with Bhargava, Remete and Swaminathan from 2023, where Hermite's finiteness result from 1857 involving `Hermite equivalence classes' is compared with the above-mentioned modern results involving $\mathbb{Z}$-equivalence and $GL_2(\mathbb{Z})$-equivalence, and where it is confirmed that Hermite's result from 1857 is much weaker than the modern results mentioned. The results of Győry from 1973 and Evertse and Győry from 1991 together established a general effective reduction theory of integral polynomials with given non-zero discriminant, which has significant consequences and applications, including Győry's effective finiteness theorems from the 1970's on monogenic orders and number fields. We give an overview of these in our paper. We also give an overview of bounds on the number of times a given order is monogenic or rationally monogenic. In the Appendix we discuss related topics not strictly belonging to the reduction theory of integral polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an analogue of Kida's formula for the Iwasawa invariants of the Mazur-Tate elements attached to elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$. Let $p$ be an odd prime and let $L/K$ be a Galois extension of abelian number fields with $p$-power Galois group. For an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$, we study the Mazur-Tate elements over the finite layers of the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of $K$ and $L$. We show that the vanishing of the $μ$-invariant is preserved in the extension: if the level-$n$ Mazur-Tate element over $K$ has $μ= 0$, then the corresponding element over $L$ also has $μ= 0$. Moreover, the associated $λ$-invariants satisfy an explicit transition formula. This parallels the work of Hachimori-Matsuno on Selmer groups and of Matsuno on $p$-adic $L$-functions. As an application, we obtain an analogue of Kida's formula for the analytic Iwasawa invariants associated to Pollack's signed $p$-adic $L$-functions. Since our results apply to elliptic curves with any reduction type at $p$ under mild hypotheses, including those with additive reduction, we also obtain a Kida-type formula for the $p$-adic $L$-functions constructed by Delbourgo for elliptic curves with unstable additive reduction. In particular, because Mazur-Tate elements approximate $p$-adic $L$-functions in the limit, our results unify all previously known cases of Kida's formula for analytic Iwasawa invariants.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a given positive integer $n$ and $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ a finite extension of ramification degree $e$, we determine the number of finite Galois extensions $L/K$ with inertia degree $f$ and a single nonnegative ramification jump at $n$ as long as $(p,e)$ is outside of a finite set. This builds upon the tamely ramified case, which is a classical consequence of Serre's Mass Formula, exhibiting a more restrictive behavior than in the tamely ramified case because the degrees of such extensions are bounded. We do this by working in a fixed Lubin-Tate extension and exploiting the surjectivity of a map corresponding to the ramification jump to reconstruct the $U^1$ part of the norm subgroup (coming from local class field theory) from its fibers and then by understanding how the fibers interact by studying them in terms of properties of the formal logarithm and partitions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** V2: typos fixed, ready for submission

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a set $E \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$, the distance set is defined as $Δ(E) := \{\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\| : \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in E\}$, where $\|\cdot\|$ denotes the standard quadratic form. We investigate the Erdős--Falconer distance problem within the flexible class of $(u, s)$--Salem sets introduced by Jonathan M. Fraser, with emphasis on the even case $u = 4$. By exploiting the exact identity between $\|\widehat{E}\|_4$ and the fourth additive energy $Λ_4(E)$, we prove that quantitative gains in $Λ_4(E)$ force the existence of many distances. In particular, for a $(4, s)$--Salem set $E\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ with $d \geq 2$, if $$ |E|\gg q^{\min\left\{\frac{d+2}{4s+1}, \frac{d+4}{8s}\right\}}, $$ then $E$ determines a positive proportion of all distances. This strictly improves Fraser's threshold of $\frac{d}{4s}$ and the Iosevich-Rudnev bound of $q^{\frac{d+1}{2}}$ in certain parameter ranges. As applications, we obtain improved thresholds for multiplicative subgroups and sets on arbitrary varieties, and establish a sharp incidence bound for Salem sets that is of independent interest in incidence geometry. Moreover, our methods give sharp lower bounds for the number of distinct distances determined by two different sets. We also propose a unified conjecture for $(4, s)$--Salem sets that reconciles known bounds and pinpoints the odd-dimensional sphere regime: in odd dimensions $d \geq 3$, the often-cited $\frac{d-1}{2}$ threshold does not follow without additional structures. This provides a clear picture of the spherical distance conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ and $B$ be sets in a finite vector space. In this paper, we study the magnitude of the set $A\cap f(B)$, where $f$ runs through a set of transformations. More precisely, we will focus on the cases that the set of transformations is given by orthogonal matrices or orthogonal projections. We prove that if $A, B\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ satisfy some natural conditions, then, for almost every $g\in O(d)$, there are at least $\gg q^d$ elements $z\in \mathbb{F}_q^d$ such that $$|A\cap (g(B)+z)| \sim \frac{|A||B|}{q^d}.$$ This implies that $|A-gB|\gg q^d$ for almost every $g\in O(d)$. In the flavor of expanding functions, with $|A|\le |B|$, we also show that the image $A-gB$ grows exponentially. In two dimensions, the result simply says that if $|A|=q^x$ and $|B|=q^y$, as long as $0<x\le y<2$, then for almost every $g\in O(2)$, we can always find $ε=ε(x, y)>0$ such that $|A-gB|\gg |B|^{1+ε}$. To prove these results, we need to develop new and robust incidence bounds between points and rigid motions by using a number of techniques including algebraic methods and discrete Fourier analysis. Our results are essentially sharp in odd dimensions. In the prime field plane, we further employ recent $L^2$ distance bounds and point-line/plane incidence machinery to derive improvements. Notable applications include a strong prime field analogue of a question of Mattila related to the Falconer distance problem, the Rotational Erdős-Falconer distance problem, and a quadratic expansion law. Taken together, the results in this paper present a robust two-way link between intersection phenomena and distance problems over finite fields, with dimension-uniform consequences and sharpness in several ranges.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is a finishing touch to the (over 200 years) {\em classical} `Galois Theory' of {\em arbitrary} finite field extensions, i.e. the goal of it is to describe intermediate subfields of an arbitrary finite field extension via {\em invariants} of `natural/obvious' objects that are associated with subfields via two Galois-type correspondences. The classical Galois Theory covers the case of finite Galois field extensions. For finite Galois field extensions the objects are their Galois groups and their invariants. In \cite{GaloisTh-RingThAp}, we introduce a new (ring theoretic) approach to the Galois Theory which is based on the {\em principle of maximal symmetry}. In \cite{AnGaloisTh-NORMAL-Fields}, the maximal symmetry of {\em normal} finite field extensions yields an analogue of the Galois Theory for them. For a normal finite field extension $L/K$ the `natural/obvious' objects are the subalgebra $\CD (L/K)\rtimes G(L/K)$ of $\End (L/K)$ that is generated by the automorphism group $G(L/K)$ and the algebra $\CD (L/K)$ of differential operators on $L/K$ and its `invariants'. The `maximal symmetry' means the equality $\End (L/K)=\CD (L/K)\rtimes G(L/K)$ which turns out to be a characteristic property of {\em normal} finite field extensions, \cite{AnGaloisTh-NORMAL-Fields}. The aim of this paper is to obtain an analogue of the Galois Theory for {\em arbitrary} finite field extensions based on results and ideas of \cite{GaloisTh-RingThAp} and \cite{AnGaloisTh-NORMAL-Fields}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a split reductive $p$-adic Lie group. This paper is the first in a series on the construction of locally analytic $G$-representations which do not lie in the principal series. Here we consider the case of the general linear group $G=GL_{n+1}$ and locally analytic representations which are induced by cuspidal modules of the Lie algebra. We prove that they are ind-admissible and satisfy the homological vanishing criterion in the definition of supercuspidality in the sense of Kohlhaase. In the case of $n=1$ we give a proof of their topological irreducibility for certain cuspidal modules of degree 1.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a new definition of a Frobenius structure on an algebra object in a monoidal category, generalising Frobenius algebras in the category of vector spaces. Our definition allows Frobenius forms valued in objects other than the unit object, and can be seen as a categorical version of Frobenius extensions of the second kind. When the monoidal category is pivotal we define a Nakayama morphism for the Frobenius structure and explain what it means for this morphism to have finite order. Our main example is a well-studied algebra object in the (additive and idempotent completion of the) Temperley-Lieb category at a root of unity. We show that this algebra has a Frobenius structure and that its Nakayama morphism has order 2. As a consequence, we obtain information about Nakayama morphisms of preprojective algebras of Dynkin type, considered as algebras over the semisimple algebras on their vertices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be an odd prime number and let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field in which $p$ is split. Let $f$ be a modular form with good reduction at $p$. We study the variation of the Bloch--Kato Selmer groups and the Bloch--Kato--Shafarevich--Tate groups of $f$ over the anticyclotomic $\mathbf{Z}_p$-extension $K_\infty$ of $K$. In particular, we show that under the generalized Heegner hypothesis, if the $p$-localization of the generalized Heegner cycle attached to $f$ is primitive and certain local conditions hold, then the Pontryagin dual of the Selmer group of $f$ over $K_\infty$ is free over the Iwasawa algebra. Consequently, the Bloch--Kato--Shafarevich--Tate groups of $f$ vanish. This generalizes earlier works of Matar and Matar--Nekovář on elliptic curves. Furthermore, our proof applies uniformly to the ordinary and non-ordinary settings.</p></details>

> **Comment:** generalized formulae and generalized conjecture

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Schanuel Conjecture contains all ``reasonable" statements that can be made on the values of the exponential function. In particular it implies the Lindemann-Weierstrass Theorem. In my Ph.D. I showed that Schanuel Conjecture has a geometrical origin: it is equivalent to the Grothendieck-André periods Conjecture applied to a 1-motive without abelian part. In this paper, we state a conjecture in Schanuel style, which will imply conjectures in Lindemann-Weierstrass style, for the semi-elliptic exponential function, that is for the exponential map of an extension G of an elliptic curve E by a multiplicative group. We propose the semi-elliptic Conjecture, which concerns the exponential function, the Weierstrass $\wp,$ $ζ$ functions and Serre functions. The case of a trivial extension has been treated in \cite{BW}, where we introduced the split semi-elliptic Conjecture. As in Schanuel's case, we expect that the semi-elliptic Conjecture contains all ``reasonable" statements that can be made on the values of the exponential function, of the Weierstrass $\wp$, $ζ$ functions and of Serre functions. We show that the semi-elliptic Conjecture has a geometrical origin (as Schanuel Conjecture): it is equivalent to the Grothendieck-André periods Conjecture applied to a 1-motive whose underlying abelian part is an elliptic curve. We prove the Grothendieck-André periods Conjecture for 1-motives defined by an elliptic curve with algebraic invariants and complex multiplication and by torsion points. We introduce the $σ$-Conjecture which involves the Weierstrass $\wp$, $ζ$ and $σ$ functions and we show that this conjecture is a consequence of the Grothendieck-André periods Conjecture applied to an adequate 1-motive.</p></details>

It turns out that the automorphism groups of one-point algebraic geometry codes agree with that of the Abdón--Torres function field except for the trivial cases. Moreover, we provide a family of maximal function fields with explicit defining equations via considering fixed subfields with respect to some subgroups of automorphism group of the Abdón--Torres function field.</p></details>

We consider two types of algebraic extensions in this paper; one is of extensions obtained by adjoining the coordinates of certain points of various semiabelian varieties; the other is of extensions obtained as the fixed subfield in an algebraically closed field by a finite number of automorphisms. Some of such fields turn out to be new examples of Kummer-faithful fields which are not sub-$p$-adic. Among them, we find both examples of Kummer-faithful fields over which the Mordell--Weil group modulo torsion can be free of infinite rank and not free.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Stone duality establishes a contravariant equivalence between the category of Boolean algebras and the category of compact, Hausdorff, totally disconnected topological spaces (Stone spaces). These spaces are precisely the profinite spaces and form the natural environment for arithmetic objects such as the $p$-adic integers, absolute Galois groups, and profinite completions. In this article we give a rigorous and self-contained development of the construction of the Stone space associated to a Boolean algebra, prove Stone's representation theorem, and describe profinite spaces as inverse limits of finite systems. From there we introduce the Stone--Čech compactification via its universal property and discuss central arithmetic examples (such as $β\mathbb{N}$ and profinite completions), emphasizing their structural role in arithmetic geometry and in the framework of Condensed Mathematics of Clausen--Scholze. The text is aimed at advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students, as well as readers interested in the interface between topology, number theory, and new categorical formulations of topology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Skein algebras of surfaces quantize character varieties of topological surfaces, and in low genus, these quantizations are often related to algebras arising in representation theory. For example, Terwilliger defined a universal $SL_2$ spherical double affine Hecke algebra $A$; a combination of results in the literature shows $A$ is isomorphic to the $SL_2$ skein algebra of the punctured torus. Stated skein algebras are a generalization which quantize decorated character varieties. In this paper, we used stated skein algebras to construct a new embedding of $A$ into a rank 6 quantum torus, and we show that each marked 3-manifold with a torus boundary produces a module over $A$. We also determine a generating set for the stated skein algebra of $T^2\setminus D^2$, and we find many relations; however, finding a complete list of relations is still an open problem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the underlying geometry of the Spence--Kummer functional equation for the trilogarithm. Our geometry determines a certain path system on the projective line minus three points, connecting the standard tangential base point to the nine variables of the $Li_{3}$ terms in the equation, which reflects the geometry of the so-called non-Fano arrangement. Consequently, we derive a precise form of the Spence--Kummer equation together with its $\ell$-adic Galois analogue by using algebraic relations between polylogarithm generating series arising from the path system. We apply the tensor and homotopy criteria for functional equations of iterated integrals due to Zagier and Nakamura--Wojtkowiak. To compute the lower-degree terms of the functional equation in both the complex and the $\ell$-adic Galois cases, we also focus on a diagram of three geometric objects: the moduli space $M_{0,5}$, the complement to the Coxeter arrangement of type ${\rm B_3}$, and the complement to the non-Fano arrangement.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the torus-equivariant homology $H_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_G)$ of the affine Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}_G$, where $G=\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ is the symplectic group. This homology admits a natural ring structure and a Schubert basis, giving rise to a well-defined Schubert calculus. We realize $H_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_G)$ in terms of symmetric functions. Our first main result introduces a new family of symmetric functions, called the \emph{dual affine Schur $P$-functions}, which represent the Schubert classes. These functions are defined through the action of the affine nil-Hecke algebra, and specialize, in the stable limit as $n\to \infty$, to the dual factorial $P$-functions of Nakagawa and Naruse. Our second main result gives a precise comparison between this symmetric function model and the geometric construction of $H_*^T (\mathrm{Gr}_G)$ due to Ginzburg and Peterson, which identifies it with a coordinate ring of a centralizer family in the Langlands dual group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent work by Botkin, Dawsey, Hemmer, Just and the present author, a deterministic model of prime number distribution is developed based on properties of integer partitions that gives almost exact estimates for $π(n)$, the number of primes less than or equal to positive integer $n$, up to $n=10{,}000$. In this follow-up paper, the author summarizes the ideas behind this partition-theoretic model of primes and formulates a computational model that is practically exact in its estimates of $π(n)$ up to $n=100,000$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We verify the conjecture on continuous-trace subquotients for $C^*$-algebras of nilpotent linear dynamical systems, where by linear dynamical system we mean a continuous action of the additive group of real numbers by linear maps on a finite-dimensional real vector space. In addition, we show that the dimension of the ambient vector space can be recovered from the corresponding $C^*$-algebra and, if the action is nilpotent of degree two, the corresponding group is $C^*$-rigid within the class of 1-connected nilpotent Lie groups with coadjoint orbits of dimension $\le 2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using a previous novel way of defining kernel functions for Laplacian integral operators on a compact $p$-adic analytic manifold $X$, one such operator $Δ_0^s$ with $s\in\mathds{R}$ is applied to hearing the Serre invariant $i(X)$ by showing that a wavelet eigenvalue is always congruent to $i(X)$ modulo $q-1$, where $q$ is the cardinality of the residue field $k$ attached to a $p$-adic number field $K$. It is shown how the number of $k$-rational points of the special fibre of the Néron model of an elliptic curve defined over $K$ relates to the wavelet spectrum of $Δ^s_0$, and this then leads to the realisation that the Serre invariant $i(E(X))$ in the case of an elliptic curve $E$ with split multiplicative reduction vanishes modulo $q-1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A class number formula is proved for extended ring class fields $L_{\mathcal{O},9}$ over imaginary quadratic fields $K_d = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d})$, in which the prime $p = 3$ splits, by determining the fields generated by the periodic points of a well-chosen algebraic function. The number of periodic points of a given period $n \ge 2$ for this algebraic function equals six times the sum of class numbers of imaginary quadratic orders $\textsf{R}_{-d}$, for which the Artin symbol for a prime ideal divisor $\wp_3$ in $K_d$ of $3$ has order $n$ in the Galois group of $F_d/K_d$, where $F_d$ is the inertia field of $\wp_3$ in $L_{\mathcal{O},9}/K_d$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix primes $p$ and $\ell$ with $\ell\neq p$. If $(A,λ)$ is a $g$-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety, an $(\ell)^g$-isogeny of $(A,λ)$ has kernel a maximal isotropic subgroup of the $\ell$-torsion of $A$; the image has a natural principal polarization. We define three isogeny graphs associated to such $(\ell)^g$-isogenies -- the big isogeny graph $\mathit{Gr}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$, the little isogeny graph $\mathit{gr}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$, and the enhanced isogeny graph $\widetilde{\mathit{gr}}_{\!g}(\ell, p)$. We prove that all three isogeny graphs are connected. One ingredient of the proof is strong approximation for the quaternionic unitary group, which has previously been applied to moduli of abelian varieties in charateristic $p$ by Chai, Ekedahl/Oort, and Chai/Oort. The adjacency matrices of the three isogeny graphs are given in terms of the Brandt matrices defined by Hashimoto, Ibukiyama, Ihara, and Shimizu. We study some basic properties of these Brandt matrices and recast the theory using the notion of Brandt graphs. We show that the isogeny graphs $\mathit{Gr}_{\!g}(\ell, p)$ and $\mathit{gr}_{\!g}(\ell, p)$ are in fact our Brandt graphs. We give the $\ell$-adic uniformization of $\mathit{gr}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$ and $\widetilde{\mathit{gr}}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$. The $(\ell+1)$-regular isogeny graph $\mathit{Gr}_1(\ell,p)$ for supersingular elliptic curves is well known to be Ramanujan. We calculate the Brandt matrices for a range of $g>1$, $\ell$, and $p$. These calculations give four examples with $g>1$ where the regular graph $\mathit{Gr}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$ has two vertices and is Ramanujan, and all other examples we computed with $g>1$ and two or more vertices were not Ramanujan. In particular, the $(\ell)^g$-isogeny graph is not in general Ramanujan for $g>1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the problem of representing the fraction $5/P$ as a sum of three distinct unit fractions $1/A+1/B+1/C$ with $A<B<C$ and $A,B,C\in\mathbb{N}$. The case of primes $P\equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ is analyzed, where two constructive types of solutions arise: ED1 (exactly one denominator divisible by $P$, namely $C=cP$) and ED2 (exactly two denominators divisible by $P$, namely $B=bP$ and $C=cP$). Parametric constructions and enumeration algorithms are developed, including explicit transitions between ED1 and ED2. A deterministic algorithm is proposed, based on the intersection of a parametric lattice defined by pairs $(α,d')$ with bounded boxes. For each fixed prime $P\equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ the algorithm constructively produces a solution. Using analytic methods such as the Bombieri--Vinogradov theorem and the Chebotarev density theorem, it is shown that the density of admissible parameters is high, which yields polylogarithmic search complexity in the average case. A strict complexity guarantee for all primes remains conditional and depends on the finite covering hypothesis. This study extends previous work for coefficient $4$ (the Erdős--Straus conjecture) to coefficient $5$, transferring the same structure of parametrization and constructive solutions. Analytic applications provide averaging tools used for density estimates in parametric boxes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates the distribution of rational and algebraic points of bounded weighted height in weighted projective spaces over number fields. For a weighted projective space with weights q over a number field k of degree m, we derive an asymptotic formula for the count of such points, featuring a leading term D times X raised to m e Q, plus an error term, where e is the extension degree and Q is the sum of the weights. The constant D combines geometric aspects of the weights with an arithmetic obstruction given by the reciprocal of the gcd of the least common multiple of the weights and Euler's totient of m e. This obstruction stems from the non-surjectivity of the natural morphism from the weighted space to ordinary projective space on rational points, linked to nontrivial torsors under groups of roots of unity. We provide a cohomological interpretation, analogous to the Brauer-Manin obstruction. These findings refine a weighted version of the Batyrev-Manin conjecture and open avenues for applications in moduli theory and arithmetic geometry.</p></details>
