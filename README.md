### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16975v1'>2601.16975</a>\]&nbsp; **Explicit Brauer-Manin obstructions on plane quartics**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nils Bruin, Brendan Creutz &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe a method to show a plane quartic over a number field has no rational points. The method can be adapted to show that a curve does not have divisors of degree 1 or 2 and can be generalized to arbitrary smooth projective curves. Our approach significantly improves on the applicability over previous 2-cover descent methods by not requiring the computation of the full $S$-unit group of the étale algebras involved. We illustrate the practicality with several examples, including examples where we determine plane quartics to be of index 2 or 4 when the maximum local index is strictly smaller.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Chahat Ahuja &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The visibility of lattice points from the origin along a polynomial family of curves constitutes a significant generalization of visibility along straight lines. Following the classical notion, where the density equals 1/2, and its generalization to monomial curves of the form y = a x^b, where the density equals 1/(b+1), we study a family of polynomial curves defined by y = q(a_n x^n + ... + a_1 x), where q is a positive rational number. We introduce a new criterion based on a polynomial greatest common divisor condition that provides a lower bound on the number of visible lattice points in N^2. Conversely, we derive conditions under which a given lattice point becomes the next visible point along such a polynomial curve. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we also obtain an exact double-sum formula for the number of pairs (a, b) less than or equal to N that are visible with respect to this polynomial family. Finally, we extend the framework to related problems and pose several open questions concerning gap distributions and quantitative bounds for non-visible points. This work provides a broader theoretical foundation for lattice point visibility beyond linear and monomial settings.</p></details>

A deformed version of this isomorphism was established in the previous paper of the author. For the Steinberg block of $\mathcal{O}$, we construct an abelian equivalence to the category of equivariant sheaves on the Springer resolution.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gabriele Bogo, Yingkun Li &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Generalizing the work of Atkin and Kaneko-Zagier in the elliptic case, we describe the non-ordinary locus of a genus-zero non-compact curve $Y$ in a Hilbert modular variety in terms of the zeros of generalized Atkin's orthogonal polynomials. The argument relies on the recent construction of lifts of partial Hasse invariants for $Y$. We further describe these orthogonal polynomials as denominators of Padé approximants to the logarithmic derivatives of solutions of the Picard-Fuchs differential equations associated with $Y$. This provides a new link between Padé approximation and the geometry of the non-ordinary locus, extending a classical observation of Igusa for the Legendre family and applying, in particular, to situations where the Picard-Fuchs equations do not admit modular solutions. As applications, we determine the three-term recurrence relations for Atkin polynomials attached to triangle curves via hypergeometric identities, and compute the supersingular locus of a double cover of the Teichmüller curve $W_{17}$. In the latter case, we conjecture that the associated supersingular polynomial is self-reciprocal, implying that supersingular points occur in pairs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the (graded) Jordan-Hölder multiplicities of (mixed) tilting sheaves on flag varieties admit a geometric interpretation as the hypercohomology of certain sheaves on Richardson varieties in the Langlands dual flag variety. These sheaves are a motivic variant of geometric extensions, and provide a replacement for parity sheaves on the Richardson variety. We also provide an explicit formula for these multiplicities in terms of $\ell$-Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct characteristic-zero lifts of partial Hasse invariants for genus zero non-compact curves in Hilbert modular varieties. The construction is based on recent results on the associated Picard-Fuchs differential equations. As an application, we relate the size of the non-ordinary locus of the modulo $p$ reduction of these curves to the dimension of spaces of (twisted) modular forms. We compute it explicitly for several Teichmüller curves, obtaining Deuring-like formulae. Moreover, we study the modulo $p$ reduction of (twisted) modular forms on not necessarily arithmetic genus-zero Fuchsian groups with modular embedding.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study canonical basis elements in higher-level Fock spaces associated with the quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_\infty)$, which are conjecturally related to Calogero-Moser theory for complex reflection groups. We generalize the Leclerc-Miyachi formula to arbitrary levels by introducing new explicit constructions based on symbols, including a column removal theorem and closed formulas in several cases. These results provide explicit descriptions of canonical basis elements with applications to Calogero-Moser cellular characters and to the decomposition matrices of Ariki-Koike algebras.</p></details>

We also compute the action of differentials $d_N$ in Rasmussen spectral sequences from HOMLFY-PT to $\mathfrak{gl}(N)$ homology of $(n,n+1)$ torus knots.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Skolem Problem asks to determine whether a given linear recurrence sequence (LRS) has a zero term. Showing decidability of this problem is equivalent to giving an effective proof of the Skolem-Mahler-Lech Theorem, which asserts that a non-degenerate LRS has finitely many zeros. The latter result was proven over 90 years ago via an ineffective method showing that such an LRS has only finitely many $p$-adic zeros. In this paper we consider the problem of determining whether a given LRS has a $p$-adic zero, as well as the corresponding function problem of computing exact representations of all $p$-adic zeros. We present algorithms for both problems and report on their implementation. The output of the algorithms is unconditionally correct, and termination is guaranteed subject to the $p$-adic Schanuel Conjecture (a standard number-theoretic hypothesis concerning the $p$-adic exponential function). While these algorithms do not solve the Skolem Problem, they can be exploited to find natural-number and rational zeros under additional hypotheses. To illustrate this, we apply our results to show decidability of the Simultaneous Skolem Problem (determine whether two coprime linear recurrences have a common natural-number zero), again subject to the $p$-adic Schanuel Conjecture.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Vladimir Shchigolev &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the space of all bimodule homomorphisms $R_x\otimes_R R(\underline{t})\otimes_R R_y\to R_z\otimes_R R(\underline{t}')\otimes_R R_w$ as a one-sided module, where $R_x,R_y,R_z,R_w$ are standard twisted bimodules and $R(\underline{t})$ and $R(\underline{t}')$ are the Bott-Samelson bimodules corresponding to sequences of reflections $\underline{t}$ and $\underline{t}'$ respectively. We prove that this module is always reflexive under some reasonable restrictions on the representation of the underlying Coxeter group. However, unlike the case where $\underline{t}$ and $\underline{t}'$ contain only simple reflections, this module does not need any longer to be free. We provide a series of counterexamples already for the symmetric groups $S_n$, where $n\ge4$. The projective dimension of the modules dual to them is $n-3$ and thus serves to measure the deviation from the free modules. When placed within a geometric framework, these examples show how to find fibers of points fixed by the compact torus in the Bott-Samelson resolutions (as in the original definition by Raoul Bott and Hans Samelson) with non-vanishing odd cohomology.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hideto Asashiba, Etienne Gauthier, Enhao Liu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Major updates: (1) a general formula for computing interval multiplicity (resp. rank) invariants of persistence modules under any (resp. rank) compression system $ξ$; (2) clearer definition of essential covers (relative to $ξ$); (3) added GitHub link for interval rank invariant and replacement computations (under tot and ss); (4) fixed typos and refined notions

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define two notions. The first one is a $rank\ compression\ system$ $ξ$ for a finite poset $\mathbf{P}$ that assigns each interval subposet $I$ to an order-preserving map $ξ_I \colon I^ξ \to \mathbf{P}$ satisfying some conditions, where $I^ξ$ is a connected finite poset. An example is given by the $total$ compression system that assigns each $I$ to the inclusion of $I$ into $\mathbf{P}$. The second one is an $I$-$rank$ of a persistence module $M$ under $ξ$, the family of which is called the $interval\ rank\ invariant$ of $M$ under $ξ$. A compression system $ξ$ makes it possible to define the $interval\ replacement$ (also called the interval-decomposable approximation) not only for 2D persistence modules but also for any persistence modules over any finite poset. We will show that the forming of the interval replacement preserves the interval rank invariant, which is a stronger property than the preservation of the usual rank invariant. Moreover, to know what is preserved by the replacement explicitly, we will give a formula of the $I$-rank of $M$ under $ξ$ in terms of the structure linear maps of $M$ for any compression system $ξ$. The formula leads us to a concept of essential cover, which gives us a sufficient condition for the $I$-rank of $M$ under $ξ$ to coincide with that under another compression system $ζ$. This is applied to the case where $ξ= \mathrm{tot}$, the value of $I$-rank under which is equal to the generalized rank invariant introduced by Kim--Mémoli, to give an alternative proof of the Dey--Kim--Mémoli theorem computing the generalized rank invariant by using a zigzag path.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The depth of a subgroup $H$ of a finite group $G$ is a positive integer defined with respect to the inclusion of the corresponding complex group algebras $\mathbb{C}H \subseteq \mathbb{C}G$. This notion was originally introduced by Boltje, Danz and Külshammer in 2011, and it has been the subject of numerous papers in recent years. In this paper, we study the depth of core-free subgroups, which allows us to apply powerful computational and probabilistic techniques that were originally designed for studying bases for permutation groups. We use these methods to prove a wide range of new results on the depth of subgroups of almost simple groups, significantly extending the scope of earlier work in this direction. For example, we establish best possible bounds on the depth of irreducible subgroups of classical groups and primitive subgroups of symmetric groups. And with the exception of a handful of open cases involving the Baby Monster, we calculate the exact depth of every subgroup of every almost simple sporadic group. We also present a number of open problems and conjectures.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 27 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop and numerically analyze an algebraic-geometric framework for spin-adapted coupled-cluster (CC) theory. Since the electronic Hamiltonian is SU(2)-invariant, physically relevant quantum states lie in the spin singlet sector. We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct automata with input(s) in base $k$ recognizing some basic relations and study their number of states. We also consider some basic operations on $k$-automatic sequences and discuss their state complexity. We find a relationship between subword complexity of the interior sequence $(h'(i))_{i \geq 0}$ and state complexity of the linear subsequence $(h(ni+c))_{i \geq 0}$. We resolve a recent question of Zantema and Bosma about linear subsequences of $k$-automatic sequences with input in most-significant-digit-first format. We also discuss the state complexity and runtime complexity of using a reasonable interpretation of Büchi arithmetic to actually construct some of the studied automata recognizing relations or carrying out operations on automatic sequences.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Chabauty--Kim method was developed with the aim of approaching effective Faltings', the problem of explicitly determining the finite set of rational points on a hyperbolic curve. This method has seen success with the more particular Quadratic Chabauty method, but this method still applies only to certain curves. Previous applications of Chabauty--Kim beyond the quadratic level, as pursued by the authors, by S. Wewers, and by others, use mixed Tate motives and the $p$-adic period map of Chatzistamatiou-Ünver to approach the particular hyperbolic curve $\mathbb{P}^1\setminus\{0,1,\infty\}$. The main purpose of this article is to lay foundations for extending the above approach to more general hyperbolic curves, in particular by defining an analogous $p$-adic period map for more general categories of motives and their non-conjectural cousins such as systems of realizations and $p$-adic Galois representations. We use this to describe a general setup for non-abelian Chabauty for an arbitrary hyperbolic curve. Our period map also connects the study of $p$-adic iterated integrals with Goncharov's theory of motivic iterated integrals, and allows us to investigate Goncharov's conjectures from a $p$-adic point of view. In particular, it suggests the possibility of evaluating syntomic regulators by writing elements of $K$-theory in terms of motivic iterated integrals. Lastly, it forms the basis for a certain generalization of the $p$-adic period conjecture of Yamashita for mixed Tate motives well-suited to applications in Chabauty--Kim theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A diagram consisting of differential graded (dg for short) categories and dg functors is formulated in this paper as a colax functor $X$ from a small category $I$ to the 2-category $\mathbf{k}$-dgCat of small dg categories, dg functors and dg natural transformations over a fixed commutative ring $\mathbf{k}$. If $I$ is a group regarded as a category with only one object $*$, then $X$ is nothing but a colax action of the group $I$ on the dg category $X(*)$. In this sense, this $X$ can be regarded as a generalization of a dg category with a colax action of a group. We define a notion of standard derived equivalence between such colax functors by generalizing the corresponding notion between dg categories with a group action. Our first main result gives some characterizations of this notion, one of which is given in terms of generalized versions of a tilting object and a quasi-equivalence. On the other hand, for such a colax functor $X$, the dg categories $X(i)$ with $i$ objects of $I$ can be glued together to have a single dg category $\int_I X$, called the Grothendieck construction of $X$. Our second main result asserts that for such colax functors $X$ and $X'$, the Grothendieck construction $\int_I X'$ is derived equivalent to $\int_I X$ if there exists a standard derived equivalence from $X'$ to $X$. These results generalize the first-named author's results to the dg case, respectively. Even for dg categories with group actions, these results are new. In particular, the second result gives a new tool to show the derived equivalence between the orbit categories of dg categories with group actions, which will be illustrated in some examples.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the low lying zeros of $GL(2) \times GL(2)$ Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions. Assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis, we compute the $1$-level density of the low-lying zeroes of $L(s, f \otimes g)$ averaged over families of Rankin-Selberg convolutions, where $f, g$ are cuspidal newforms with even weights $k_1, k_2$ and prime levels $N_1, N_2$, respectively. The Katz-Sarnak density conjecture predicts that in the limit, the $1$-level density of suitable families of $L$-functions is the same as the distribution of eigenvalues of corresponding families of random matrices. The 1-level density relies on a smooth test function $φ$ whose Fourier transform $\widehatφ$ has compact support. In general, we show the Katz-Sarnak density conjecture holds for test functions $φ$ with $\mathrm{supp} \widehatφ\subset (-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$. When $N_1 = N_2$, we prove the density conjecture for $\mathrm{supp} \widehatφ\subset (-\frac{5}{4}, \frac{5}{4})$ when $k_1 \ne k_2$, and $\mathrm{supp} \widehatφ\subset (-\frac{29}{28}, \frac{29}{28})$ when $k_1 = k_2$. A lower order term emerges when the support of $\widehatφ$ exceeds $(-1, 1)$, which makes these results particularly interesting. The main idea which allows us to extend the support of $\widehatφ$ beyond $(-1, 1)$ is an analysis of the products of Kloosterman sums arising from the Petersson formula. We also carefully treat the contributions from poles in the case where $k_1 = k_2$. Our work provides conditional lower bounds for the proportion of Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions which are non-vanishing at the central point and for a related conjecture of Keating and Snaith on central $L$-values.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a criterion for non-vanishing of period integrals on automorphic representations of a general linear group over a division algebra. We consider three different periods: linear periods, twisted-linear periods and Galois periods. Our criterion is a local-global principle, which is stated in terms of local distinction, a further local obstruction, and poles of certain global L-functions associated to the underlying involution via the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence. Our local-global principle follows from a new method, relying on the Maass-Selberg relations and a careful analysis of singularities of local and global intertwining periods. Our results generalize to inner forms, known results for split general linear groups. Moreover, our result for twisted linear periods is new even in the split situation. As a consequence of our local-global principle, we complete the proof of one direction of the Guo-Jacquet conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study higher uniformity properties of the von Mangoldt function $Λ$, the Möbius function $μ$, and the divisor functions $d_k$ on short intervals $(x,x+H]$ for almost all $x \in [X, 2X]$. Let $Λ^\sharp$ and $d_k^\sharp$ be suitable approximants of $Λ$ and $d_k$, $G/Γ$ a filtered nilmanifold, and $F\colon G/Γ\to \mathbb{C}$ a Lipschitz function. Then our results imply for instance that when $X^{1/3+\varepsilon} \leq H \leq X$ we have, for almost all $x \in [X, 2X]$, $$ \sup_{g \in \text{Poly}(\mathbb{Z} \to G)} \left| \sum_{x < n \leq x+H} (Λ(n)-Λ^\sharp(n)) \overline{F}(g(n)Γ) \right| \ll H\log^{-A} X $$ for any fixed $A>0$, and that when $X^{\varepsilon} \leq H \leq X$ we have, for almost all $x \in [X, 2X]$, $$ \sup_{g \in \text{Poly}(\mathbb{Z} \to G)} \left| \sum_{x < n \leq x+H} (d_k(n)-d_k^\sharp(n)) \overline{F}(g(n)Γ) \right| = o(H \log^{k-1} X). $$ As a consequence, we show that the short interval Gowers norms $\|Λ-Λ^\sharp\|_{U^s(X,X+H]}$ and $\|d_k-d_k^\sharp\|_{U^s(X,X+H]}$ are also asymptotically small for any fixed $s$ in the same ranges of $H$. This in turn allows us to establish the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture and the divisor correlation conjecture with a short average over one variable. Our main new ingredients are type $II$ estimates obtained by developing a "contagion lemma" for nilsequences and then using this to "scale up" an approximate functional equation for the nilsequence to a larger scale. This extends an approach developed by Walsh for Fourier uniformity.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 27 pages. No figures. Part of a six-paper series on Algebraic Phase Theory

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop the representation theory intrinsic to Algebraic Phase Theory (APT) in regimes where defect and canonical filtration admit faithful algebraic realisation. This extends the framework introduced in earlier work by incorporating a representation-theoretic layer that is compatible with defect and filtration. In this setting, algebraic phases act naturally on filtered module categories rather than on isolated objects, and classical irreducibility must be replaced by a filtration-compatible notion of indecomposability forced by defect. As a central application, we analyse the Frobenius Heisenberg algebraic phase, which occupies a rigid boundary regime within the broader APT landscape, and show that it satisfies the axioms of APT in a strongly admissible form. We study the representations realising this phase and show that their non-semisimplicity and rigidity properties are consequences of the underlying algebraic structure rather than analytic or semisimple hypotheses. In particular, we establish a Stone von Neumann type rigidity theorem for Heisenberg groups associated with finite Frobenius rings. For each such ring $R$, we construct a canonical Schrödinger representation of the Frobenius Heisenberg group $H_R$, and show that, for a fixed nontrivial central character, every centrally faithful representation of $H_R$ is equivalent to this model. The proof is entirely algebraic and uses no topology, unitarity, Fourier analysis, or semisimplicity. Instead, rigidity emerges as a boundary phenomenon governed by defect and canonical filtration. The Frobenius hypothesis is shown to be sharp: it precisely delineates the structural boundary within APT at which Heisenberg rigidity persists, and outside the Frobenius class this rigidity necessarily fails.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a new class of functions that arise naturally in quaternionic analysis, we call them "quasi regular functions". Like the well-known quaternionic regular functions, these functions provide representations of the quaternionic conformal group. However, unlike the regular functions, the quasi regular ones do not admit an invariant unitary structure but rather a pseudounitary equivalent. The reproducing kernels of these functions have an especially simple form: (Z-W)^{-1}. We describe the K-type bases of quasi regular functions and derive the reproducing kernel expansions. We also show that the restrictions of the irreducible representations formed from the quasi regular functions to the Poincare group have three irreducible components. Our interest in the quasi regular functions arises from an application to the study of conformal-invariant algebras of quaternionic functions. We also introduce a factorization of certain intertwining operators between tensor products of spaces of quaternionic functions. This factorization is obtained using fermionic Fock spaces constructed from the quasi regular functions.</p></details>

When the support of $μ$ is finite and includes an irrational rotation satisfying a Diophantine condition, we establish a local central limit theorem (LCLT) for $Y_N$ down to super-polynomially small scales. When $μ$ includes rotations satisfying a further algebraic condition, we prove that a LCLT holds down to the scale $\exp(-cN^{1/3}/(\log N)^2)$. Due to group-theoretic obstructions, this is sharp for symmetric $μ$, up to the $\log$ factor. Lastly for a special class of asymmetric $μ$, we obtain an LCLT down to the much finer scale $\exp(-cN^{1/2})$. The proofs relate the fine-scale distribution of $Y_N$ to a question about the values of integer polynomials on the unit circle.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study skein modules of 3-manifolds by embedding them into the Hilbert spaces of 4d ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theories. When the 3-manifold has reduced holonomy, we present an algorithm to determine the dimension and the list of generators of the skein module with a general gauge group. The analysis uses a deformation preserving ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry to express the dimension as a sum over nilpotent orbits. We find that the dimensions often differ between Langlands-dual pairs beyond the A-series, for which we provide a physical explanation involving chiral symmetry breaking and 't Hooft operators. We also relate our results to the structure of $\mathbb{C}^*$-fixed loci in the moduli space of Higgs bundles. This approach helps to clarify the relation between the gauge-theoretic framework of Kapustin and Witten with other versions of the geometric Langlands program, explains why the dimensions of skein modules do not exhibit a TQFT-like behavior, and provides a physical interpretation of the skein-valued curve counting of Ekholm and Shende.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1980, Odoni initiated the study of the fixed-point proportion of iterated Galois groups of polynomials motivated by prime density problems in arithmetic dynamics. The main goal of the present paper is to completely settle the longstanding open problem of computing the fixed-point proportion of geometric iterated Galois groups of polynomials. Indeed, we confirm the well-known conjecture that Chebyshev polynomials are the only complex polynomials whose geometric iterated Galois groups have positive fixed-point proportion. Our proof relies on methods from group theory, ergodic theory, martingale theory and complex dynamics. This result has direct applications to the proportion of periodic points of polynomials over finite fields. The general framework developed in this paper applies more generally to rational functions over arbitrary fields and generalizes, via a unified approach, previous partial results, which have all been proved with very different methods.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show the failure of the pointwise convergence of averages along the Omega function in a number field. As a consequence, we show, for instance, that the averages $$ \frac{1}{N^2}\sum_{1\leq m,n \leq N} f(T^{Ω(m^2+n^2)}x)$$ do not converge pointwise in ergodic systems, addressing a question posed by Le, Moreira, Sun, and the second author. On the other hand, using number-theoretic methods, we establish the pointwise convergence of averages along the $Ω$ function defined on the ideals of a number field in uniquely ergodic systems. Using this dynamical framework, we also derive several natural number-theoretic consequences of independent interest.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field of characteristic different from $2$ and of residual characteristic $p$. We generalise the theory of the Weil representation over $F$ with complex coefficients to $\ell$-modular representations \textit{i.e.} when the complex coefficients are replaced by a coefficient field $R$ of characteristic $\ell \neq p$. We obtain along the way a generalisation of the Stone-von Neumann theorem to the $\ell$-modular setting, together with the Weil representation with coefficients in $R$ on the $R$-metaplectic group. Surprisingly enough, the latter $R$-metaplectic group happens to be split over the symplectic group if $\ell = 2$. The theory also makes sense when $F$ is a finite field of odd characteristic. We also establish the irreducibility of the theta lift in the cuspidal case as long as $\ell$ does not divide the pro-orders of the groups at stake and we provide a compatibility to congruences in this setting via an integral version of the theta lift.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Extend the previous results to general Hecke elements

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>According to the relative Langlands functoriality conjecture, an admissible morphism between the $L$-groups of spherical varieties should induce a functorial transfer of the corresponding local and global automorphic spectra. Via the relative trace formula approach, two basic problems are the local transfer and the fundamental lemma on the geometric side of the relative trace formulae. In this paper, we consider the rank one spherical variety case, where the admissible morphism between the $L$-groups is the identity morphism, in which case, Y. Sakellaridis has already established the local transfer. We formulate the statement of the fundamental lemma for the general rank one spherical variety case and prove the fundamental lemma for the rank one spherical varieties of classical types.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the category of $C_1$-cofinite modules for the universal $N=1$ super Virasoro vertex operator superalgebra $\mathcal{S}(c,0)$ at any central charge $c$ is locally finite and admits the vertex algebraic braided tensor category structure of Huang-Lepowsky-Zhang. For central charges $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t)=\frac{15}{2}-3(t+t^{-1})$ with $t\notin\mathbb{Q}$, we show that this tensor category is semisimple, rigid, and slightly degenerate, and we determine its fusion rules. For central charge $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(1)=\frac{3}{2}$, we show that this tensor category is rigid and that its simple modules have the same fusion rules as $\mathrm{Rep}\,\mathfrak{osp}(1\vert 2)$, in agreement with earlier fusion rule calculations of Milas. Finally, for the remaining central charges $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t)$ with $t\in \mathbb{Q}^\times$, we show that the simple $\mathcal{S}(c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t),0)$-module $\mathcal{S}_{2,2}$ of lowest conformal weight $h^{\mathfrak{ns}}_{2,2}(t)=\frac{3(t-1)^2}{8t}$ is rigid and self-dual, except possibly when $t^{\pm 1}$ is a negative integer or when $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t)$ is the central charge of a rational $N=1$ superconformal minimal model. As $\mathcal{S}_{2,2}$ is expected to generate the category of $C_1$-cofinite $\mathcal{S}(c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t),0)$-modules under fusion, rigidity of $\mathcal{S}_{2,2}$ is the first key step to proving rigidity of this category for general $t\in\mathbb{Q}^\times$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Anderson t-modules are analogs of abelian varieties in positive characteristic. Associated to such a t-module, there are its t-motive and its dual t-motive. When dealing with these objects, several questions occur which one would like to solve algorithmically. For example, for a given t-module one would like to decide whether its t-motive is indeed finitely generated free, and determine a basis. Reversely, for a given object in the category of t-motives one would like to decide whether it is the t-motive associated to a t-module, and determine that t-module. In this article, we positively answer such questions by providing the corresponding algorithms. As it turned out, the main part of all these algorithms stem from a single algorithm in non-commutative algebra, and hence the first part of this article doesn't deal with Anderson's objects at all, but are results on finitely generated modules over skew polynomial rings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the rationality problem for multinorm one tori, a natural generalization of norm one tori. For multinorm one tori that split over finite Galois extensions with nilpotent Galois group, we prove that stable rationality and retract rationality are equivalent, and give a criterion for the validity of the above two conditions. This generalizes the result of Endo (2011) on the rationality problem for norm one tori. To accomplish it, we introduce a generalization of character groups of multinorm one tori. Moreover, we establish systematic reduction methods originating in work of Endo (2001) for an investigation of the rationality problem for arbitrary multinorm one tori. In addition, we provide a new example for which the multinorm principle holds.</p></details>

In this introductory article, we explore the combinatorial structure of these operators and discuss a general framework for constructing their higher-dimensional analogues from the representation-theoretic perspective on branching problems. The exposition is based on lectures delivered by the authors during the thematic semester ``Representation Theory and Noncommutative Geometry", held in Spring 2025 at the Henri Poincaré Institute in Paris.</p></details>

We aim for a self-contained treatment, not relying on previous work on algebraic or analytic motives. Applying the theory to discrete fields, one still recovers the etale version of Voevodsky's theory. Two notable features of our setting which do not hold in other settings are that over any base, the cancellation theorem holds true, and under only minor assumptions on the base, the stable $\infty$-category of motivic sheaves is rigid dualizable.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a condensable algebra in a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$. We define an action of the fusion category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ on the morphism space $\mbox{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(x,A)$ for any $x$ in $\mathcal{C}$, whose characters are generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of the Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\mathcal{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\mathcal{B}$ to $A^\mathcal{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOAs, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\mathcal{C}_A}$ where $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{M}_U$ is the category of $U$-modules. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\mathcal{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$</p></details>

> **Comment:** 44 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the mode transition algebras and Zhu algebras in the setting of $\mathbb{Z}$-graded vertex algebras, with particular focus on the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 (also known as bosonic ghosts or the $βγ$-system). We show that the mode transition algebras of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 admit unity elements that form a family of strong unities in the sense of Damiolini-Gibney-Krashen. The existence of unities for the mode transition algebra of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 allows us to explicitly construct all higher level Zhu algebras of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2. We further analyze weak modules of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 induced from Zhu algebras, proving that every such module is already induced from the level-zero Zhu algebra. We then prove that all indecomposable reducible weight modules induced from a Zhu algebra are not weakly interlocked, and hence not strongly interlocked in the sense of Barron-Batistelli-Orosz Hunziker-Yamskulna. More generally, we show that the property of being weakly interlocked is preserved under the action of an invertible Li's $\mathbfΔ$ operator. As an application, we prove that all indecomposable reducible weight modules of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 obtained via spectral flow of Zhu-induced modules are likewise not weakly interlocked. These results clarify the role of being weakly interlocked in the modularity properties of bosonic ghost modules previously studied by Ridout-Wood and Allen-Wood.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $V$ be an $\mathbb{N}$-graded, simple, self-contragredient, $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra. We show that if the $S$-transformation of the character of $V$ is a linear combination of characters of $V$-modules, then the category $\mathcal{C}$ of grading-restricted generalized $V$-modules is a rigid tensor category. We further show, without any assumption on the character of $V$ but assuming that $\mathcal{C}$ is rigid, that $\mathcal{C}$ is a factorizable finite ribbon category, that is, a not-necessarily-semisimple modular tensor category. As a consequence, we show that if the Zhu algebra of $V$ is semisimple, then $\mathcal{C}$ is semisimple and thus $V$ is rational. The proofs of these theorems use techniques and results from tensor categories together with the method of Moore-Seiberg and Huang for deriving identities of two-point genus-one correlation functions associated to $V$. We give two main applications. First, we prove the conjecture of Kac-Wakimoto and Arakawa that $C_2$-cofinite affine $W$-algebras obtained via quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction of admissible-level affine vertex algebras are strongly rational. The proof uses the recent result of Arakawa and van Ekeren that such $W$-algebras have semisimple (Ramond twisted) Zhu algebras. Second, we use our rigidity results to reduce the "coset rationality problem" to the problem of $C_2$-cofiniteness for the coset. That is, given a vertex operator algebra inclusion $U\otimes V\hookrightarrow A$ with $A$, $U$ strongly rational and $U$, $V$ a pair of mutual commutant subalgebras in $A$, we show that $V$ is also strongly rational provided it is $C_2$-cofinite.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For Iwahori-spherical genuine representations of central covers with positive real Satake parameters, we prove the upper bound inequality for their geometric wavefront sets, formulated for general genuine representations in an earlier work by Gao--Liu--Lo--Shahidi. Meanwhile, we show the equality is attained for covers of type A groups and for some representations of covers of the exceptional groups. We also verify the equality for certain Iwahori-spherical representations occurring in regular unramified principal series; this uses and generalizes the earlier work of Karasiewicz--Okada--Wang on theta representations. Lastly, we determine the leading coefficients in the Harish-Chandra character expansion of a theta representation when its geometric wavefront set is of a special type.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate certain generalizations of Camina pairs. Let $H$ be a nontrivial proper subgroup of a finite group $G$. We first show that every nontrivial irreducible complex character of $H$ induces homogeneously to $G$ if and only if for every $x\in G\setminus H$, the element $x$ is conjugate to $xh$ for all $h\in H$. Furthermore we prove that if $xh$ is conjugate to either $x$ or $x^{-1}$ for all $h\in H$ and all $x\in G\setminus H$, then the normal closure $N$ of $H$ in $G$ also satisfies the same condition, and $N$ is nilpotent. Finally, we determine the structure of $H$ under the assumption that for every element $x\in G\setminus H$ of odd order, the coset $xH$ consists entirely of elements of odd order.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Consider the $(\mathfrak{g}, K)$-modules $L_λ$ for unitary highest weight representations of the real reductive group $G_{\mathbb{R}} = \mathrm{U}(p,q)$, $\mathrm{Mp}(2n, \mathbb{R})$, or $\mathrm{O}^*(2n)$, where $\mathrm{Mp}(2n,\mathbb{R})$ denotes the metaplectic double cover of $\mathrm{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{R})$. Let $k$ be a positive integer. Corresponding to $G_{\mathbb{R}}$ via Howe duality is the compact group $\mathrm{U}(k)$, $\mathrm{O}(k)$, or $\mathrm{Sp}(k)$, respectively, for which every irreducible representation $σ$ corresponds to a unique $L_λ = L_{λ(σ)}$. Nishiyama-Ochiai-Taniguchi (2001) expressed the Bernstein degree $\mathrm{Deg} L_{λ(σ)}$ as the product of $\dim σ$ and the degree of the associated variety of $L_{λ(σ)}$; this result is valid when $k \leq r :=$ the real rank of $G_{\mathbb{R}}$. In this paper, for arbitrary $k$, we give a new combinatorial interpretation $\mathrm{Deg} L_{λ(σ)} = \#(\mathcal{Q}_k(σ) \times \mathcal{P}_k)$, where $\mathcal{Q}_k(σ)$ is a certain set of semistandard tableaux, whose cardinality (for $k \geq r$) interpolates between $\dim σ$ and the dimension of the simple $K$-module with highest weight $λ(σ)$. The set $\mathcal{P}_k$ consists of certain plane partitions that encode the Hilbert series of the associated variety. We exhibit analogous sets $\mathcal{P}_k$ of plane partitions for all real reductive groups of Hermitian type, including the exceptional groups.</p></details>

Using Colmez's theory of periods of CM abelian varieties, we propose a definition for the height of a partial CM-type and prove that the Colmez conjecture follows from an arithmetic period formula for surfaces. We give an explicit conjecture for the form of this period formula, which relates the height of special points on a Shimura surface with special values of $L$-functions. Further, we relate the heights of periods given by Colmez to arithmetic degree of Hermitian line bundles and thus give a formulation of Colmez's full conjecture in geometric terms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper aims to employ a cluster-theoretic approach to provide a class of Diophantine equations whose solutions can be obtained by starting from initial solutions through mutations. We establish a novel framework bridging cluster theory and Diophantine equations through the lens of cluster symmetry. On the one hand, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for Laurent polynomials to remain invariant under a given cluster symmetric map. On the other hand, we construct a discriminant algorithm to determine whether a given Laurent polynomial has cluster symmetry and whether it can be realized in a generalized cluster algebra. As applications, we solve Markov-cluster equations, describe some invariant Laurent polynomial rings, and resolve the questions posed by Gyoda and Matsushita.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 53 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent work, Harman and Snowden constructed a symmetric tensor category associated to an oligomorphic group equipped with a measure. The oligomorphic group $\mathbb{G}$ of order preserving automorphisms of the real line admits exactly four measures. The category $\mathcal{C}$ associated to the first measure is called the (first) Delannoy category; it is semi-simple and pre-Tannakian, with numerous special properties. In this paper, we study the (non-abelian) category $\mathcal{A}$ associated to the second measure, which we call the second Delannoy category. We construct a new pre-Tannakian category $\mathcal{D}$ together with a fully faithful tensor functor $Ψ\colon \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{D}$. The category $\mathcal{D}$ is the correct ``abelian version'' of the second Delannoy category. Like $\mathcal{C}$, it has remarkable properties: for instance, it is non-semi-simple, but behaves uniformly in the coefficient field (e.g., it has the same Grothendieck ring and $\mathrm{Ext}^1$ quiver over any field). Additionally, we completely solve the problem of understanding how $\mathcal{A}$ relates to general pre-Tannakian categories. We show that $\mathcal{A}$ admits exactly two local abelian envelopes: the functor $Ψ$, and a previously constructed functor $Φ\colon \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{C}$. This is the first case where the local envelopes of a category have been completely determined, outside of cases where there is at most one envelope. This work opens the door to constructing abelian versions of other oligomorphic tensor categories that do not admit a unique envelope.</p></details>

In addition, we use this computation and a sieve-theoretic argument to show that there exists a number with at most 2 prime factors (counting multiplicity) between $n^3$ and $(n+1)^3$ for all $n\geq 1$. Our sieving argument uses a logarithmic weighting procedure attributed to Richert, which yields significant numerical improvements over previous approaches.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a perfect field with $\mathrm{char}(k)\neq 2,3$, set $K=k(t)$, and let $\mathcal{W}_n^{\min}$ be the moduli stack of minimal elliptic curves over $K$ of Faltings height $n$ from the height-moduli framework of Bejleri-Park-Satriano applied to $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1,1}\simeq \mathcal{P}(4,6)$. For $[E]\in \mathcal{W}_n^{\min}$, let $S \to \mathbb{P}^1_{k}$ be the associated elliptic surface with section. Motivated by the Shioda-Tate formula, we consider the trivariate motivic height zeta function $$ \mathcal{Z}(u,v;t):= \sum_{n\ge0}\Bigl(\sum_{[E]\in \mathcal{W}_n^{\min}} u^{T(S)}v^{\mathrm{rk}(E/K)}\Bigr)t^n \in K_0(\mathrm{Stck}_k)[u,v][[t]] $$ which refines the height series by weighting each height stratum with the trivial lattice rank $T(S)$ and the Mordell--Weil rank $\mathrm{rk}(E/K)$. We prove rationality for the trivial lattice specialization $Z_{\mathrm{Triv}}(u;t)=\mathcal{Z}(u,1;t)$ by giving an explicit finite Euler product. We conjecture irrationality for the Néron-Severi $Z_{\mathrm{NS}}(w;t)=\mathcal{Z}(w,w;t)$ and the Mordell-Weil $Z_{\mathrm{MW}}(v;t)=\mathcal{Z}(1,v;t)$ specializations.</p></details>

The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $γ+δ/e=\mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $γ^{(n)}+δ^{(n)}/e=η^{(n)}$, $n\ge0$ for sequences of constants $γ^{(n)}$, $δ^{(n)}$, and $η^{(n)}$ (given respectively by raw, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). Investigating the $γ^{(n)}=\left(-1\right)^{n}Γ^{(n)}(1)$ through recurrence relations, we find that the $γ^{(n)}$ are transcendental infinitely often and that at least two of each set {$γ,γ^{(n)},γ^{(n+1)},...,γ^{(2n)}$}, for $2\leq n\leq26$, are transcendental (with analogous results for $Γ^{(n)}(1)$). We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $η^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent, and therefore transcendental, for all $n\ge0$, implying that at least one of each pair, {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e$} and {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e,δ^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n\ge1$. Further analysis of the $γ^{(n)}$ and $η^{(n)}$ reveals that the $δ^{(n)}/e$ and $δ^{(n)}$ are transcendental infinitely often with asymptotic densities of at least 1/2. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tildeδ^{(n)}$ and $\tildeη^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $γ^{(n)}+\tildeδ^{(n)}/e=\tildeη^{(n)}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a deterministic polynomial time algorithm to compute the endomorphism ring of a supersingular elliptic curve in characteristic p, provided that we are given two noncommuting endomorphisms and the factorization of the discriminant of the ring $\mathcal{O}_0$ they generate. At each prime $q$ for which $\mathcal{O}_0$ is not maximal, we compute the endomorphism ring locally by computing a q-maximal order containing it and, when $q \neq p$, recovering a path to $\text{End}(E) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_q$ in the Bruhat-Tits tree. We use techniques of higher-dimensional isogenies to navigate towards the local endomorphism ring. Our algorithm improves on a previous algorithm which requires a restricted input and runs in subexponential time under certain heuristics. Page and Wesolowski give a probabilistic polynomial time algorithm to compute the endomorphism ring on input of a single non-scalar endomorphism. Beyond using techniques of higher-dimensional isogenies to divide endomorphisms by a scalar, our methods are completely different.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Dirichlet's Lemma states that every primitive quadratic Dirichlet character $χ$ can be written in the form $χ(n) = (\fracΔn)$ for a suitable quadratic discriminant $Δ$. In this article we define a group, the separant class group, that measures the extent to which Dirichlet's Lemma fails in general number fields $F$. As an application we will show that over fields with trivial separant class groups, genus theory of quadratic extensions can be made as explicit as over the rationals.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that for a non-isotrivial abelian scheme over a smooth curve, the genus of a generic sequence of multi-sections with small heights tends to infinity. As an application, we give a new proof of the uniform boundedness of $\ell$-primary torsion points on fibers of an abelian scheme over a smooth curve, a result originally proved by Cadoret and Tamagawa. Furthermore, our approach allows us to resolve a conjecture of Cadoret and Tamagawa without additional assumptions. Our approach is based on the theory of Betti foliations and the arithmetic equidistribution theorem.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yuhao Cheng &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>At the beginning of this century, Langlands introduced a strategy known as \emph{Beyond Endoscopy} to attack the principle of functoriality. Altuğ studied $\mathsf{GL}_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ in the unramified setting. The first step involves isolating specific representations, especially the residual part of the spectral side, in the elliptic part of the geometric side of the trace formula. We generalize this step to the case with ramification at $S=\{\infty,q_1,\dots,q_r\}$ with $2\in S$, thereby fully resolving the problem of isolating these representations over $\mathbb{Q}$ which remained unresolved for over a decade. Such a formula that isolates the specific representations is derived by modifying Altuğ's approach. We use the approximate functional equation to ensure the validity of the Poisson summation formula. Then, we compute the residues of specific functions to isolate the desired representations.</p></details>
