 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Weiwen Zhang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article we will introduce a central problem in additive combinatorics, which arised from the famous van der Waerden theorem and an early conjecture of Erdős and Turán. The first important theorem was due to Roth in 1953. There were a number of generalized or improved results afterwards, which we call Roth-type theorems. We will list them and try to give concise expositions to the ideas in some of the proofs without much prior knowledge.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In our paper from 1985 we have constructed two integrals of the Riemann's function $Z^2(t)$ over two disconnected sets with asymptotically equal measures such that these two integrals differ by considerably big excess. In the present paper we use the formula for that excess to construct a new $ζ$-equivalent of the Fermat-Wiles theorem on a two-parametric set of lemniscates of Bernoulli.</p></details>

> **Comment:** extended abstract of 9 pages, 1 figure, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this extended abstract, we study special tropical prevarieties which we call Coxeter Dressians. They arise from equations capturing a generalization of valuated symmetric basis exchange for Coxeter matroids. In particular, we study subdivisions of the associated Coxeter matroid polytopes. We show that the subdivisions induced by points of the Coxeter Dressian consist of cells which are strong Coxeter matroidal. This generalizes well-known results in type $A$ to other Lie types. Finally, we implement explicit computations of Coxeter Dressians in OSCAR.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 27 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we construct recollements and ladders for Brieskorn-Pham singularities via reduction/insertion functors, and study the singularity categories of the Brieskorn-Pham singularities using these ladders. In particular, we construct a class of tilting objects, called the extended tilting $n$-cuboids, whose endomorphism algebras are $n$-fold tensor products of certain Nakayama algebras. Moreover, we show that such an endomorphism algebra is derived equivalent to a certain replicated algebra. This generalizes the Happel-Seidel symmetry to the context of Brieskorn-Pham singularities.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 9 pages (+ references)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the geometric Sen morphism of a de Rham torsor over a smooth rigid analytic variety over a $p$-adic field is the unique lift, along a natural map, of the Kodaira--Spencer morphism of the associated filtered torsor with integrable connection. This extends previous computations in the minuscule case, and implies that the geometric Sen morphism is the derivative of the lattice Hodge period map. The computation applies, in particular, to non-minuscule period domains generalizing local Shimura varieties, furnishing new examples of towers satisfying He's stalkwise perfectoidness.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 1 page (+ references)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $C/\mathbb{Q}_p$ a complete algebraically closed field, we construct a collection of non-isomorphic rank two $\mathbb{Q}_p$-local systems on $\mathbb{P}^1_C$ indexed by $C$. This implies that the de Jong fundamental group $π_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^1_C)$ depends on $C$ and, if $C$ has cardinality $>2^{\mathbb{N}}$, that $π_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^1_C)$ is not topologically countably generated. The argument in fact applies to any connected rigid analytic variety over $C$ with a non-constant function to $\mathbb{P}^1_C$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Heizo Sakamoto &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 60pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Kashiwara-Kim-Oh-Park introduced a wide family of monoidal categories of finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras, which provide monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras. In this paper, we prove that, for types $ADE$, some of these categories provide monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras of affine type. Moreover, by means of the combinatorial theory of affine type cluster algebras, we give a complete classification of real and imaginary simple modules in these categories. In particular, we show that, in these cases, the conjecture asserting that real simple modules correspond exactly to cluster monomials holds.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Job Daisie Rock, Hugh Thomas &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 31 pages, 7 figures, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a continuous version of preprojective algebras of type $A$. In particular, we are interested in the preprojective category over an open, bounded subinterval $\mathbb{I}$ of $\mathbb{R}$, denoted $Λ_{\mathbb{I}}$. We study the representable projective modules and define a useful type of sub- and quotient module called decorous modules. These are completely described by a function from the closure $\overline{\mathbb{I}}$ of $\mathbb{I}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ whose 'slopes' are not too steep anywhere. We later use these to describe permuton ideals, a generalization of the support $τ$-tilting ideals of preprojective algebras of type $A_n$, which we call permutation ideals. Once we have our generalization, we show that permutation ideals can be recovered from permuton ideals. Moreover, permutation ideals are $τ$-rigid and we show an analogous property for our permuton ideals. Along the way, we classify all the brick $Λ_{\mathbb{I}}$-modules.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Edison H L Au-Yeung &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Division polynomials associated to an elliptic curve $E/K$ are polynomials $φ_n, ψ_n^2$ that arise from the sequence of points $\{nP\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ on this curve. If one wishes to study $\mathbb{Z}$--linear combination of points on $E(K)$, we can use net polynomials $Φ_{v}, Ψ_{v}^2$ which are higher--dimensional analogue of division polynomials. It turns out they are also elliptic nets, an $n$--dimensional array with values in $K$ satisfying the same nonlinear recurrence relation that division polynomials do as well. Now further assume the elliptic curve $E/K$ has complex multiplication by an order of a quadratic imaginary field $F \subseteq K$, we will prove a formula for the common valuation of $Φ_{v}$ and $Ψ_{v}^2$ associated to multiples of points by elements of an order in $F$. As an application, we will use the formula to show that elliptic divisibility sequences associated to multiples of points indexed by elements of an order also satisfy a recurrence relation when indexed by elements of an order, subject to certain conditions on the indices. Additionally, we also expect that the formula may also be used in computing $\mathcal{O}_K$--integral points of an elliptic curve of rank $2$ with complex multiplication (this is future work).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the coordinate ring of the Vinberg monoid of a simply connected semisimple complex group is an upper cluster algebra. As an application, we construct cluster structures on a large class of flat reductive monoids. After localization, we obtain cluster structures on any connected reductive group whose commutator group is simply connected.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Periodic lattices are natural generalizations of lattices, which arise naturally in diophantine approximations with rationals of bounded denominators. In this paper, we prove analogues of classical theorems in geometry of numbers for periodic lattices in function fields.

> **Comment:** 23 pages. v2: corrected the proof of Lemma 6.10; added Example 6.16

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Geiss, Leclerc and Schröer introduced a class of 1-Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras $H$ associated to symmetrizable Cartan matrices with acyclic orientations, generalizing the path algebras of acyclic quivers. They also proved that indecomposable rigid $H$-modules of finite projective dimension are in bijection with non-initial cluster variables of the corresponding Fomin-Zelevinsky cluster algebra. In this article, we prove in all affine types that their conjectural Caldero-Chapoton type formula on these modules coincide with the Laurent expression of cluster variables. By taking generic Caldero-Chapoton functions on varieties of modules of finite projective dimension, we obtain bases for affine type cluster algebras with full-rank coefficients containing all cluster monomials.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kaiji. Kondo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the present paper, we study the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local fields from the point of view of anabelian geometry. In particular, we show that, under certain mild assumptions, the image of the natural homomorphism from the automorphism group of a mixed-characteristic local field to the outer automorphism group of the associated absolute Galois group is not a normal subgroup. Furthermore, we show that, for the absolute Galois group of a mixed-characteristic local field satisfying certain assumptions, there exist a continuous representation and a continuous automorphism of the group such that the former is irreducible, abelian, and crystalline, but the continuous representation obtained as the composite of the former with the latter is not even Hodge-Tate. These results significantly generalize previous works by Hoshi and Nishio. A key observation in obtaining these results is to focus on the analogy between the mapping class groups of topological surfaces and the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local fields. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first work applying results from the theory of mapping class groups to the anabelian geometry of mixed-characteristic local fields, going beyond a mere analogy between the two.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine the Brauer group of the Deligne-Mumford stack $\mathscr{Y}_0(2)$, the moduli space of elliptic curves with a marked $2$-torsion subgroup over bases of arithmetic interest. Antieau and Meier determine the Brauer group for $\mathscr{M}_{1,1}$, the moduli stack of elliptic curves by exploiting the fact it is covered by the Legendre family and using the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence. Over an algebraically closed field, Shin uses the coarse space map to determine the Brauer group of $\mathscr{M}_{1,1}$. We combine techniques from both papers to determine the Brauer group of $\mathscr{Y}_0(2)$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gabriele Bogo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the holomorphic solutions of Picard-Fuchs differential equations associated with one-parameter families of abelian varieties with real multiplication admit power series expansions with $S$-integral coefficients at a maximal unipotent monodromy point. This extends classical integrality results for hypergeometric functions and Bouw-Möller's work on Teichmüller curves. The integral solutions are related to the non-ordinary locus of the modulo $p$ reduction of the family, whose cardinality we bound in terms of the Euler characteristic and Lyapunov exponents of the base curve. In some cases, the non-ordinary locus can be recovered by truncating the integral solutions, as in Igusa's classical observation for the Legendre family. We also establish $S$-integrality of expansions of modular forms at cusps in terms of a modular function for (not necessarily arithmetic) Fuchsian groups with modular embeddings, and deduce congruences. These results are applied in subsequent work to construct lifts of partial Hasse invariants for rational curves in Hilbert modular varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be an odd prime integer, $F/\mathbb{Q}$ be an imaginary quadratic field, and $Ψ$ be a small slope cuspidal Bianchi modular form over $F$ which is non-ordinary at $p$. In this article, we first construct a $p$-adic distribution $L^{\mathrm{As}}_{p}(Ψ)$ that interpolates the twisted critical $L$-values of Asai (or twisted tensor) $L$-function of $Ψ$, generalizing the works of Loeffler--Williams from the ordinary case to the non-ordinary case. To obtain this distribution, we construct some polynomials using Asai--Eisenstein elements: the Betti analogue of the Euler system machinery, developed by Loeffler--Williams. We use some techniques analogous to those of Loeffler--Zerbes for interpolating the twists of Beilinson--Flach elements arising in the Euler system associated with Rankin--Selberg convolutions of elliptic modular forms. We also use the interpolation method developed by Amice--Vélu, Perrin-Riou, and Büyükboduk--Lei in the construction. Furthermore, under some assumptions, we decompose these unbounded $p$-adic distributions into the linear combination of bounded measures as done by Pollack, Sprung, and Lei--Loeffler--Zerbes in the elliptic modular forms case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p\geq 3$ be a prime number and $K$ be a quadratic imaginary field in which $p$ splits as $\mathfrak{p}\overline{\mathfrak{p}}$. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a cuspidal Bianchi eigenform over $K$ of weight $(k,k)$, where $k\geq 0$ is an integer, level $\mathfrak{m}$ coprime to $p$, and non-ordinary at both of the primes above $p$. We assume $\mathcal{F}$ has trivial nebentypus. For $\mathfrak{q}\in\{\mathfrak{p}, \overline{\mathfrak{p}}\}$, let $a_{\mathfrak{q}}$ be the $T_{\mathfrak{q}}$ Hecke eigenvalue of $\mathcal{F}$ and let $α_{\mathfrak{q}},β_{\mathfrak{q}}$ be the roots of polynomial $X^{2} -a_{\mathfrak{q}}X+ p^{k+1}$. Then we have four $p$-stabilizations of $\mathcal{F}$: $\mathcal{F}^{α_{\mathfrak{p}},α_{\overline{\mathfrak{p}}}}, \mathcal{F}^{α_{\mathfrak{p}},β_{\overline{\mathfrak{p}}}}, \mathcal{F}^{β_{\mathfrak{p}},α_{\overline{\mathfrak{p}}}},$ and $ \mathcal{F}^{β_{\mathfrak{p}},β_{\overline{\mathfrak{p}}}}$ which are Bianchi cuspforms of level $p\mathfrak{m}$. By the works of Williams, to each $p$-stabilization $\mathcal{F}^{*,\dagger}$, we can attach a locally analytic distribution $L_{p}(\mathcal{F}^{*,\dagger})$ over the ray class group $\text{Cl}(K,p^{\infty})$. On viewing $L_{p}(\mathcal{F}^{*,\dagger})$ as a two-variable power series with coefficients in some $p$-adic field having unbounded denominators satisfying certain growth conditions, we decompose this power series into a linear combination of power series with bounded coefficients in the spirit of Pollack, Sprung, and Lei--Loeffler--Zerbes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a filtration by ideals on quantum cohomology for symplectic manifolds with a Hamiltonian $S^1$-action that extends to a pseudoholomorphic $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. These spaces include all Conical Symplectic Resolutions, in particular all Quiver Varieties. In particular, we obtain a family of filtrations on singular cohomology for any Conical Symplectic Resolution, that is sensitive to the choice of $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. The symplectic form is rarely exact at infinity for these spaces, so substantial foundational work is carried out to rigorously define Floer theory, in particular symplectic cohomology. Using Floer theory, we construct a periodic persistence module, giving rise to a graded periodic barcode associated to the $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This encodes birth-death phenomena of Floer invariants. Our filtrations can be viewed as a Floer-theoretic analogue of Atiyah-Bott filtrations, arising from stratifying a manifold by gradient flowlines of a Morse-Bott function, but they are distinct from those and they can detect non-topological properties of the quantum product.</p></details>

We define the expolynomial ring $R_{p,t,\mathcal{A}} = \mathbb{F}\bigl[ e^{\pm x^{p} e^{t}},\; e^{\mathcal{A} x},\; x^{\mathcal{A}} \bigr]$ associated to an additive subgroup $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathbb{F}$, and investigate its Ore extension $A_{p,t,\mathcal{A}} = R_{p,t,\mathcal{A}}[\partial; δ]$ (Weyl-type) and its derivation algebra $\mathfrak{g}_{p,t,\mathcal{A}} = \mathrm{Der}_{\mathbb{F}}(R_{p,t,\mathcal{A}})$ (Witt-type). Our main results establish: (1) the automorphism group of $R_{p,t,\mathcal{A}}$ is isomorphic to $(\mathbb{F}^{\times})^{2r+1} \rtimes \mathrm{GL}(2r+1,\mathbb{Z})$; (2) a Galois descent theorem showing that fixed-point subalgebras under finite Galois actions recover the original Weyl-type algebra; (3) the non-existence of finite-dimensional simple modules for $A_{p,t,\mathcal{A}}$; (4) the Zariski density of isomorphism classes in moduli spaces as transcendental parameters vary; (5) the stability of simplicity under generic quantum deformation; and (6) a complete representation-theoretic framework including the classification of irreducible weight modules, the construction of Harish--Chandra modules with BGG-type resolutions, and the structure of category $\mathcal{O}$. These results unify and extend classical theories of Weyl algebras, Witt algebras, and generalized Weyl algebras, while opening new directions in deformation theory, non-commutative geometry, and the representation theory of infinite-dimensional algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cluster algebras, introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky through the process of quiver mutation, have become central objects in modern algebra and geometry, linking combinatorial constructions with diverse mathematical domains such as Teichmuller theory, total positivity, and even theoretical physics. Building on foundational work by Fomin, Shapiro, and Thurston connecting cluster algebras to triangulated surfaces, recent research has extended mutation theory to infinite settings, including the infinity-gon and more general marked surfaces. In this paper, we develop a purely combinatorial framework for mutation of infinite quivers, independent of but compatible with these topological constructions. By formalizing infinite quivers as limits of embedded finite quivers, we establish a consistent definition of mutation that generalizes prior surface-based results. We then apply this framework to extend the notion of reddening sequences, special mutation sequences with significant algebraic consequences, from the finite to the infinite setting. Our approach not only unifies previous topological and combinatorial perspectives but also provides a technical foundation for further generalizations of cluster algebra theory in the infinite case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The deformation approach of arXiv:2104.07816 for computing zeta functions of one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds is generalised to cover also multiparameter manifolds. Consideration of the multiparameter case requires the development of an improved formalism. This allows us, among other things, to make progress on some issues left open in previous work, such as the treatment of apparent and conifold singularities and changes of coordinates. We also discuss the efficient numerical computation of the zeta functions. As examples, we compute the zeta functions of the two-parameter mirror octic, a non-symmetric split of the quintic threefold also with two parameters, and the $S_5$ symmetric five-parameter Hulek-Verrill manifolds. These examples allow us to exhibit the several new types of geometries for which our methods make practical computations possible. They also act as consistency checks, as our results reproduce and extend those of arXiv:hep-th/0409202 and arXiv:math/0304169. To make the methods developed here more approachable, a Mathematica package "CY3Zeta" for computing the zeta functions of Calabi-Yau threefolds, which is attached to this paper, is presented.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 13 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Raimi's classical theorem establishes a partition of the natural numbers with a remarkable unavoidability property: for every finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, there is a color class whose translate meets both parts of the partition in infinitely many points. Recently, Kang, Koh, and Tran have extended this phenomenon to the circle group, proving that there exists a measurable partition of the circle such that every finite measurable cover admits a rotation whose image meets each part of the partition in positive measure. This paper shows that this phenomenon extends beyond compact abelian groups to a wide class of non-group geometric surfaces that still exhibit \textit{a hidden one-dimensional symmetry}. Specifically, we establish analogs of Raimi's theorem for three families of surfaces (with their natural surface measures): the unit sphere $S^{n-1} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, rotational power surfaces (such as cones and paraboloids), and circular cylindrical surfaces. The common feature is that each of these surfaces carries a natural measure-preserving action of the circle group by rotation in a fixed plane and admits a measurable trivialization as a product $C \times Y$. This circle-bundle structure allows the measurable Raimi partition on the base circle to be lifted to an unavoidable partition on the manifold. Our approach is unified through a general circle-bundle theorem, which reduces all three geometric cases to verifying suitable equivariance and product disintegration properties of the surface measure.</p></details>

The improvement is not in the result or the conditions, but in the need of weaker tools on the proof itself. More precisely, we only employ modular polynomials of prime degree, instead of polynomials of arbitrary level. Furthermore, one can restrict to primes in fixed arithmetic sequence. On the proof itself, the only crucial difference appears in Cinquième pas and on the final contradiction in Septième pas of Waldschmidt's proof, but for readability, we present a complete proof with this modification. This is part of a larger project to generalize the Stéphanois theorem to the Igusa invariants of curves of genus two, as the Siegel modular polynomials in the literature are usually only considered for prime levels.

> **Comment:** Major revision: 29 pages. New unconditional spectral proof of PFR/Marton in and ; finite-field case reorganized as a corollary and exposition expanded

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We settle the Polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa (PFR/Marton) conjecture for the integers and for cyclic groups. More precisely, we show that if $A$ is a finite subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ with $|A+A| \le K|A|$, then there is a subgroup $H$ of index at most $K^{O(1)}$ such that $A$ is contained in at most $K^{O(1)}$ cosets of $H$. The proof is based on a new spectral stability dichotomy for the $L^4$ Fourier mass of $\mathbf{1}_A$: either this mass is concentrated on a span of size $K^{O(1)}$, or, after passing to a quotient of codimension $K^{O(1)}$, the doubling constant of the image of $A$ decreases by a definite power of $K$. Using Freiman modeling we transfer this dichotomy to cyclic groups, obtain polynomial Bogolyubov-type bounds, and deduce Marton's conjecture in $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$. As a corollary, we also recover and extend the finite-field formulation of Marton's conjecture: in odd characteristic we obtain a direct spectral proof, and together with the characteristic-2 result of Green, Gowers, Manners, and Tao this yields a complete resolution of the conjecture for all finite fields. For context beyond finite fields, we recall their theorem for abelian groups of bounded exponent.</p></details>

The example of a vector space and the zero locus of a quadric cone in an even number of variables are discussed in detail. In both of these cases the modulation group is closely related to algebraic groups, and we propose a conjectural method of linking modulation groups to ind-algebraic groups in general.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe the dimensions of Hochschild (co)homology groups of weighted projective curves over complex numbers. Surprisingly, all but one of those numbers depend only on the genus of the underlying non-weighted curve and the number of exceptional points. Our proof involves revising a classical representation-theoretic argument of Happel together with more recent results of Lenzing and Arinkin, Căldăraru and Hablicsek. We give concrete realizations of a large class of weighted projective lines as quotient stacks.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove two fast formulas for the Hurwitz values $ζ(2,a)$ and $ζ(3,a)$ respectively with the help of the WZ method. In them $(a)_n$ denotes the rising factorial or Pochhammer's symbol defined by $(a)_0=1$ and $(a)_n=a(a+1)\cdots(a+n-1)$ for positive integers $n$. The Huwitz $ζ$ function is defined by $ζ(s,a)=ζ(0,s,a)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (k+a)^{-s}$. In addition, we can use these fast evaluations to compute also in a rapid way Dirichlet values of the kinds $L_χ(2)$ and $L_χ(3)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the $L_p$-discrepancy of random point sets in high dimensions, with emphasis on small values of $p$. Although the classical $L_p$-discrepancy suffers from the curse of dimensionality for all $p \in (1,\infty)$, the gap between known upper and lower bounds remains substantial, in particular for small $p \ge 1$. To clarify this picture, we review the existing results for i.i.d.\ uniformly distributed points and derive new upper bounds for \emph{generalized} $L_p$-discrepancies, obtained by allowing non-uniform sampling densities and corresponding non-negative quadrature weights. Using the probabilistic method, we show that random points drawn from optimally chosen product densities lead to significantly improved upper bounds. For $p=2$ these bounds are explicit and optimal; for general $p \in [1,\infty)$ we obtain sharp asymptotic estimates. The improvement can be interpreted as a form of importance sampling for the underlying Sobolev space $F_{d,q}$. Our results also reveal that, even with optimal densities, the curse of dimensionality persists for random points when $p\ge 1$, and it becomes most pronounced for small $p$. This suggests that the curse should also hold for the classical $L_1$-discrepancy for deterministic point sets.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 101 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We undertake the study of complex rank analogues of parabolic category O defined using Deligne categories. We regard these categories as a family over an affine space, introduce a stratification on this parameter space, and formulate conjectures on the structural constancy of fibers on each stratum. Using the theory of $\mathfrak{sl}_{\mathbb{Z}}$-categorification, we prove these conjectures for admissible strata. Namely, we axiomatize the notion of multi-Fock tensor product categorifications (MFTPCs), which are interval finite highest weight categories equipped with a compatible action of commuting copies of $\mathfrak{sl}_{\mathbb{Z}}$, categorifying an external tensor product of tensor products of highest and lowest weight Fock space representations. We prove a uniqueness theorem for admissible MFTPCs and show that complex rank parabolic categories O have the structure of MFTPCs. In turn, for suitable choices of parameters, we produce an equivalence of complex rank category O with a stable limit of classical parabolic categories O, resolving our conjecture in the admissible case. These equivalences yield multiplicities of simple objects in Verma modules in terms of stable parabolic Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials, answering a question posed by Etingof. In particular, for the case of two Levi blocks of non-integral size, we completely describe the structure of the corresponding category O in terms of stable representation theory. As an application, we obtain multiplicities for parabolic analogs of hyperalgebra Verma modules introduced by Haboush in the large rank and large characteristic limit.</p></details>

If a number field $k$ has at least one complex place, there are infinitely many $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions over $k$, and some authors studied the behavior of Iwasawa invariants of these $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions. In particular, Fujii studied the case where $k$ is an imaginary quadratic field and obtained some results on the boundedness of Iwasawa $λ$-invariants in a certain infinite family of $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions. In the present article, we give analogous theorems in the case where $k$ is a quartic CM-field. One of our main theorems determines all the Iwasawa invariants, including the $ν$-invariants, of a certain infinite family of $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions over a quartic CM-field.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 38 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $ E $ be an elliptic curve defined over a number field, the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD, for short) asserts a deep relation between the group $ E(K) $ of rational points and the $ L-$function $ L(E/K, s)$ of $ E $ at $ s = 1. $ Very few explicit results about $ E(K) $ and $ L(1) $ are known, even no general method is known to determine $ L(1) $ vanishing or not for a given elliptic curve. In this paper, we study some quantities related to BSD of a special class of elliptic curves, more precisely, we study the arithmetic of quadratic twists of elliptic curves $ y^{2} = x(x + \varepsilon p )(x + \varepsilon q) $ and their $L-$function. Based on some classical works, especially those of Greenberg, Kramer-Tunnell, Kato-Rohrlich, Manin and Mazur, under some conditions, we obtain results about the vanishing of the value at $ s = 1 $ of the $ L$-function, and explicitly determine the following quantities: the norm index $ δ(E, \Q, K), $ the root numbers, the set of anomalous prime numbers, a few prime numbers at which the image of Galois representation are surjective. We also study the relation between the ranks of the Mordell-Weil groups, Selmer groups and Shafarevich-Tate groups, and the structure about the $ l^{\infty }-$Selmer groups and the Mordell-Weil groups over $ \Z_{l}-$extension via Iwasawa theory. These results provide some useful evidence toward verifying the BSD for a family of elliptic curves.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 107 pages. Comments welcome! Introduction improved to reflect and highlight the new results. Some lemmas slighly simplified

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a robust structure theory for multiple ergodic averages of commuting transformations along Hardy sequences of polynomial growth. We then apply it to derive a number of novel results on joint ergodicity, recurrence and convergence. In particular, we prove joint ergodicity for (a) pairwise independent Hardy sequences and weakly mixing transformations, (b) strongly independent Hardy sequences and ergodic transformations, (c) strongly irrationally independent Hardy sequences and totally ergodic transformations. We use these joint ergodicity results to provide new recurrence results for multidimensional patterns along strongly independent Hardy sequences, showing for instance that all subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ of positive upper density contain patterns of the form $$ (m_1, m_2),\; (m_1 + \lfloor n^{\sqrt{2}}\rfloor, m_2),\; (m_1, m_2 + \lfloor n^{\sqrt{2}} + n^{1/2}\rfloor).$$ Last but not least, we positively resolve the joint ergodicity classification problem for pairwise independent Hardy sequences, of which the aforementioned families are special cases. While building on recent technical advances (e.g. PET coefficient tracking schemes and joint ergodicity criteria), our work introduces a number of technical developments of its own. We construct a suitable generalization of Host-Kra and box seminorms that quantitatively control ergodic averages along Hardy sequences. We subsequently use them to obtain Host-Kra seminorm estimates for averages along all pairwise independent Hardy sequences. Furthermore, we develop an ergodic version of the quantitative concatenation argument that has recently found extensive use in combinatorics, number theory and harmonic analysis. Lastly, we obtain new simultaneous Taylor approximations for Hardy sequences, a crucial ingredient to deal with the aforementioned classes of Hardy sequences.</p></details>

> **Comment:** The initial article has been split into two parts: this is part one, constructing geometric universal invariants for knots, and comes with a second part, providing universal link invariants. 58 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct geometrically a universal Jones invariant as a limit of invariants given by graded intersections in configuration spaces. For any fixed level $\mathscr N$, we define a new knot invariant, called ``$\mathscr N^{th}$ Unified Jones invariant'' globalising topologically all coloured Jones polynomials at levels less than $\mathscr N$. It is defined via the intersection points between {Lagrangian submanifolds} supported on arcs and ovals in the disc. The geometry of these Lagrangians is novel: previous topological models involved immersed submanifolds rather than embedded ones. We do this by defining a new local system that refines the Lawrence representation, and depends of the distribution of multiplicities of points in the configuration space on the ovals. On the algebraic side, Habiro's famous invariant for knots \cite{H3} is a universal invariant globalising the family of coloured Jones polynomials. He conjectured that this universal invariant recovers also the ADO invariant divided by the Alexander polynomials, which was proved by Willetts \cite{W} in a version of Habiro's ring (\cite{H2}). The universal Jones invariant that we construct belongs to a different ring that comes with a map to Habiro's ring \cite{H2}. We prove that our invariant recovers this version of Habiro's invariant. The difference is that our invariant is given as a limit of new knot invariants, the $\mathscr N^{th}$ unified Jones invariants. These invariants in turn provide a geometrical understanding of sets of all coloured Jones polynomials of bounded colour, collecting more information as we increase the colour.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct geometrically two universal link invariants: universal ADO invariant and universal Jones invariant, as limits of invariants given by graded intersections in configuration spaces. More specifically, for a fixed level $\mathscr N$, we define new link invariants: ``$\mathscr N^{th}$ Unified Jones invariant'' and ``$\mathscr N^{th}$ Unified Alexander invariant''. They globalise topologically all coloured Jones polynomials for links with multi-colours bounded by $\mathscr N$ and all ADO polynomials with bounded colours. These invariants both come from the same weighted Lagrangian intersection supported on configurations on arcs and ovals in the disc. The question of providing a universal non semi-simple link invariant, recovering all the ADO polynomials was an open problem. A parallel question about semi-simple invariants for the case of knots is the subject of Habiro's famous universal knot invariant \cite{H3}. Habiro's universal construction is well defined for knots and can be extended just for certain classes of links. Our universal Jones link invariant is defined for any link and recovers all coloured Jones polynomials, providing a new semi-simple universal link invariant. The first non semi-simple universal link invariant that we construct unifies all ADO invariants for links, answering the open problem about the globalisation of these invariants.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study a natural class of Anderson t- modules, called triangular t-modules, characterized by having Drinfeld modules as their $τ$-composition factors. They form a homologically meaningful generalization of Drinfeld modules and exhibit rich arithmetic structure.\smallskip We establish criteria for purity, strict and almost strict, and develop a reduction procedure that lowers the degrees of the defining biderivations. As a consequence, every almost strictly pure triangular t-module becomes strictly pure after a finite base extension. We then investigate morphisms and isogenies between triangular t-modules, provide a characterization of triangular isogenies, and describe the algebra of endomorphisms, including a criterion for commutativity. On the analytic side, we show that all triangular t- modules are uniformizable and establish finiteness and purity criteria with consequences for Taelman's conjecture. Finally, we develop a duality theory for triangular t- modules and their biderivations, proving compatibility with $τ$-composition series and establishing analogues of the Cartier-Nishi theorem and the Weil-Barsotti formula.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The aim of this study is to show that harmonic geometric polynomials can be represented in terms of geometric polynomials. This problem was first considered by Keller [14]; however, the corresponding coefficients were not fully determined. In the present work, we provide several explicit representations of harmonic geometric polynomials in terms of geometric polynomials. Moreover, several applications of one of these representations are subsequently developed. In particular, we obtain a generalization of the classical identity for the harmonic numbers, compute an integral involving harmonic geometric polynomials and an integral involving products of harmonic geometric and geometric polynomials in terms of Bernoulli numbers. These integral formulas lead to new explicit expressions for Bernoulli numbers. In addition, we give several recurrence relations for harmonic geometric polynomials and evaluate a finite sum involving harmonic numbers and positive powers of integers.</p></details>

For $α\in \mathcal{O}_K$ with $|α| > 1$, define $$ \mathcal{D}_α= \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\mathcal{O}_K}{α^n}. $$ For $β\in \mathcal{O}_K$ with $|β|>1$ and a finite subset $A \subset \mathcal{O}_K$, define $$ S_{β,A} = \bigg\{ \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_k}{β^k}: \; a_k \in A \;\forall k \in \mathbb{N} \bigg\}. $$ Suppose that $α$ and $β$ are relatively prime. In this paper, we show that if $\dim_{\mathrm{H}} S_{β,A} < 1$, then the intersection $\mathcal{D}_α\cap S_{β,A}$ is a finite set. In general, the threshold for the Hausdorff dimension of $S_{β,A}$ is sharp. If we further assume that $\mathcal{O}_K$ is a unique factorization domain and that $\overlineα$ and $α$ are relatively prime, then we establish the finiteness of the intersection under the weaker condition $\dim_{\mathrm{H}} S_{β,A} < 2$. This extends the previously known results on the real line.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For two countably infinite fields whose multiplicative groups are isomorphic, we examine invariant couplings between the actions that these groups induce on the additive Pontryagin duals of the fields. We show that the actions are disjoint unless the fields themselves are isomorphic and the group isomorphism extends (possibly after a finite twist) to a field isomorphism. As an application, we establish equidistribution of Følner-Kloosterman sums - an extension of classical Kloosterman sums to infinite fields. Unlike the classical case over algebraic closures of finite fields, these averages exhibit an inherent multiplicative asymmetry, revealing new and fundamentally different behavior. Finally, we derive several combinatorial consequences, including results on sum-product phenomena and a Furstenberg--Sárközy-type theorem for Laurent polynomials over general fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we prove for a broad class of pseudo convex formal-analytic arithmetic surfaces, those which admit a nonconstant monic such regular function, a conjecture of Bost-Charles that the ring of regular functions has continuum cardinality. A key feature of the proof is a new formula for the pushforward of the equilibrium Green's functions for our bordered Riemann surface with boundary by a holomorphic function, a formula which has constant term related to Arakelov degree. A Fekete-Szëgo-type approximation argument then produces a polynomial "large" relative to the regular function, which in turn yields continuum many distinct regular functions.</p></details>
