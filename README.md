### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20495v2'>2509.20495</a>\]&nbsp; **Rectangle partitions generalizing integer partitions**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Krystian Gajdzica, Robin Visser, Maciej Zakarczemny &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 23 Pages, 4 Figures, 2 Tables

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a natural geometric extension of the partition function. More precisely, we investigate the problem of counting partitions of a rectangle into rectangular blocks with integer sides. Here, two partitions of a rectangle are indistinguishable if they consist of the same multiset of blocks, their geometric arrangement does not matter.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Aaron Landesman, Ishan Levy &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Comments welcome! We slightly strengthened Theorem 1.4.1 by making the constant I depend on less data by adjusting Theorem 5.0.6 and Theorem 3.1.4. This will be of use for a forthcoming paper. We also made several other minor changes

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show the homology of the Hurwitz space associated to an arbitrary finite rack stabilizes integrally in a suitable sense. We also compute the dominant part of its stable homology after inverting finitely many primes. This proves a conjecture of Ellenberg--Venkatesh--Westerland and improves upon our previous results for non-splitting racks. We obtain applications to Malle's conjecture, the Picard rank conjecture, and the Cohen--Lenstra--Martinet heuristics.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Russelle Guadalupe &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 7 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $b(n)$ be the number of partition triples $\pi=(\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi_3)$ of $n$ such that $\pi_1$ consists of distinct odd parts, and $\pi_2$ and $\pi_3$ consist of parts divisible by $4$. Utilizing modular forms, Lin obtained the generating functions for $b(3n+1)$ and $b(3n+2)$, which yields the congruence $b(3n+2)\equiv 0\pmod{3}$ for all $n\geq 0$. We provide in this note elementary proofs of these generating functions by employing $q$-series manipulations and dissection formulas. We also establish infinite families of internal congruences modulo $3$ for $b(n)$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Antonin Assoun &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** The previous proof of proposition 3 was incorrect, the hypotheses of proposition 3 (ii) have been narrowed to allow a correct proof. It does not change the conclusions we draw of the proposition. The introduction was reformulated in a (hopefully) clearer way

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In order to extend the study of the regular version of the regular inverse Galois problem to skew fields, we generalize the definition of regular field extensions for commutative fields to the case of arbitrary fields. We then propose a general version of the inverse Galois property and show that for a field k, the study of the class InvReg(k) of non-trivial regular extensions of k satisfying this property constitutes a natural generalization of the classical regular inverse Galois problem. Next, we use recent results from Behajaina, Deschamps, and Legrand on the inverse Galois problem in the noncommutative setting to show that certain skew fraction fields h(t, {\sigma}, {\delta}) belong to the class InvReg(h). Finally, we generalize Behajaina's method to construct extensions belonging to InvReg(h) that are not of the form h(t, {\sigma}) with {\sigma} an automorphism of finite order.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Matthew de Courcy-Ireland, Matthew Litman, Yuma Mizuno &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 27 pages, 7 figures, 1 table. v2: updated references, corrected eq. (9)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study orbits in a family of Markoff-like surfaces with extra off-diagonal terms over prime fields $\mathbb{F}_p$. It is shown that, for a typical surface of this form, every non-trivial orbit has size divisible by $p$. This extends a theorem of W.Y. Chen from the Markoff surface itself to others in this family. The proof closely follows and elaborates on a recent argument of D.E. Martin. We expect that there is just one orbit generically. For some special parameters, we prove that there are at least two or four orbits. Cayley's cubic surface plays a role in parametrising the exceptional cases and dictating the number of solutions mod $p$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26138v2'>2509.26138</a>\]&nbsp; **Conjectures About Cyclic Numbers: Resolutions and Counterexamples**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Duc Hieu Le &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We settle 22 conjectures of Cohen about cyclic numbers (positive integers $n$ with $\gcd(n,\varphi(n))=1$), proving 16 and disproving 6, and we completely resolve a related OEIS problem about sequences whose running averages are Fibonacci numbers. Highlights include: asymptotics for cyclics between consecutive squares with a second-order term (Conj.~9), Legendre- and $k$-fold Oppermann-type results in short quadratic intervals (Conj.~6, Conj.~20, and twin cyclics between cubes, Conj.~32), gap and growth analogs (Visser, Rosser, Ishikawa, and a sum-3-versus-sum-2 inequality; Conj.~47,~52,~54,~56), limiting ratios (Vrba and Hassani; Conj.~60,~61), and structure results for Sophie Germain cyclics (Conj.~36,~37). We also resolve two Firoozbakht-type conjectures for cyclics (Conj.~41--42). On the negative side we exhibit counterexamples to the Panaitopol, Dusart, and Carneiro analogs (Conj.~59,~53,~50--51). Finally, for the lexicographically least sequence of pairwise distinct positive integers whose running averages are Fibonacci numbers (\seqnum{A248982}), we give explicit closed forms for all $n$ and prove Fried's Conjecture~2 asserting the disjointness of the parity-defined value sets (equivalently, $F_{n+2}+2nF_{n+1}$ is never a Fibonacci number). Proofs in this paper were assisted by GPT-5.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Rongyin Wang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>P. Erd\H{o}s conjectured in 1962 that on the ring $\mathbb{Z}$, every set of $n$ congruence classes in $\mathbb{Z}$ that covers the first $2^n$ positive integers also covers the ring $\mathbb{Z}$. This conjecture was first confirmed in 1970 by R. B. Crittenden and C. L. Vanden Eynden. Later, in 2019, P. Balister, B. Bollob\'{a}s, R. Morris, J. Sahasrabudhe, and M. Tiba provided a more transparent proof. In this paper, we follow the approach used by R. B. Crittenden and C. L. Vanden Eynden to prove the generalized Erd\H{o}s' conjecture in the setting of polynomial rings over finite fields. We prove that every set of $n$ cosets of ideals in $\mathbb F_q[x]$ that covers all polynomials whose degree is less than $n$ covers the ring $\mathbb{F}_q[x]$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Stratifying systems, which have been defined for module, triangulated and exact categories previously, were developed to produce examples of standardly stratified algebras. A stratifying system $\Phi$ is a finite set of objects satisfying some orthogonality conditions. One very interesting property is that the subcategory $\mathcal{F}(\Phi)$ of objects admitting a composition series-like filtration with factors in $\Phi$ has the Jordan-H\"{o}lder property on these filtrations. This article has two main aims. First, we introduce notions of subobjects, simple objects and composition series for an extriangulated category, in order to define a Jordan-H\"{o}lder extriangulated category. Moreover, we characterise Jordan-H\"{o}lder, length, weakly idempotent complete extriangulated categories in terms of the associated Grothendieck monoid and Grothendieck group. Second, we develop a theory of stratifying systems in extriangulated categories. We define projective stratifying systems and show that every stratifying system $\Phi$ in an extriangulated category is part of a minimal projective one $(\Phi,Q)$. We prove that $\mathcal{F}(\Phi)$ is a length, Jordan-H\"{o}lder extriangulated category when $(\Phi,Q)$ satisfies a left exactness condition. We give several examples and answer a recent question of Enomoto--Saito in the negative.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Aaron Landesman, Ishan Levy &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Comments welcome! We made some minor edits, mostly to the appendix and Lemma 5.2.2, in order to increase compatibility with a forthcoming article

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the average number of surjections from class groups of quadratic function fields over $\mathbb F_q(t)$ onto finite odd order groups $H$, once $q$ is sufficiently large. These yield the first known moments of these class groups, as predicted by the Cohen--Lenstra heuristics, apart from the case $H = \mathbb Z/3\mathbb Z$. The key input to this result is a topological one, where we compute the stable rational homology groups of Hurwitz spaces associated to non-splitting conjugacy classes.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 31 pages, v2: some clarifications, refs added, v3: minor changes

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is known that a large class of characters of 2d conformal field theories (CFTs) can be written in the form of a Nahm sum. In \cite{Zagier:2007knq}, D. Zagier identified a list of Nahm sum expressions that are modular functions under a congruence subgroup of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and can be thought of as candidates for characters of rational CFTs. Motivated by the observation that the same formulas appear as the half-indices of certain 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories, we perform a general search over low-rank 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ abelian Chern-Simons matter theories which either flow to unitary TFTs or $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-zero SCFTs in the infrared. These are exceptional classes of 3d theories, which are expected to support rational and $C_2$-cofinite chiral algebras on their boundary. We compare and contrast our results with Zagier's and comment on a possible generalization of Nahm's conjecture.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kohta Gejima, Fumichika Takamizo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the sequence of the last nonzero digits of factorials in every integer base $b>2$ is not eventually periodic. We also extend the Adamczewski--Bugeaud criterion, originally formulated for integer base expansions, to Cantor base expansions associated with a periodic Cantor base. As an application, we show that a certain real number expressed through a Cantor base expansion is transcendental when the Cantor base and the digit sequence satisfy suitable conditions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 54 pages, comments welcome ; small change needed in Definition 4.7. No consequences for application to $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Functors involved in Fontaine equivalences decompose as extension of scalars and taking of invariants between full subcategories of modules over a topological ring equipped with semi-linear continuous action of a topological monoid. We give a general framework for these categories and the functors between them. We define the categories of \'etale projective $\mathcal{S}$-modules over $R$ to englobe categories that will correspond by Fontaine-type equivalences to finite free representations of a group. We study their preservation by base change, taking of invariants by a normal submonoid of $\mathcal{S}$ and coinduction to a bigger monoid. We define and study categories corresponding to finite type continuous representations over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ through the notions of finite projective $(r,\mu)$-d\'evissage and of topological \'etale $\mathcal{S}$-modules over $R$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 56 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By using the degenerate Whittaker functions, we study the Fourier expansion of the Gan-Gurevich lifts which are Hecke eigen quaternionic cusp forms of weight $k$ ($k\geq 2$, even) on the split exceptional group $G_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ which come from elliptic newforms of weight $2k$ without supercuspidal local components. In particular, our results give a partial answer to Gross' conjecture.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 11 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using the subdivision schemes theory, we develop a criterion to check if any natural number has at most one representation in the $n$-ary number system with a set of non-negative integer digits $A=\{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n\}$ that contains zero. This uniqueness property is shown to be equivalent to a certain restriction on the roots of the trigonometric polynomial $\sum_{k=1}^n e^{-2\pi i a_k t}$. From this criterion, under a natural condition of irreducibility for $A$, we deduce that in case of prime $n$ the uniqueness holds if and only if the digits of $A$ are distinct modulo $n$, whereas for any composite $n$ we show that the latter condition is not necessary. We also establish the connection of this uniqueness to the semigroup freeness problem for affine integer functions of equal integer slope; this together with the two criteria allows to fill the gap in the work of D. Klarner on the question of P. Erd\"os about densities of affine integer orbits and establish a simple algorithm to check the freeness and the positivity of density when the slope is a prime number.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix $\varepsilon > 0$. We say that a finite group $G$ is $\varepsilon$-quasirandom if every nontrivial irreducible complex representation of $G$ has degree at least $|G|^\varepsilon$.

> **Comment:** 16 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate $f$-Diophantine sets over finite fields via new explicit constructions of families of quasi-random hypergraphs from multivariate polynomials. In particular, our construction not only offers a systematic method for constructing quasi-random hypergraphs but also provides a unified framework for studying various hypergraphs arising from multivariate polynomials over finite fields, including Paley sum hypergraphs, and hypergraphs derived from Diophantine tuples and their generalizations. We derive an asymptotic formula for the number of $k$-Diophantine $m$-tuples, answering a question of Hammonds et al., and study some related questions for $f$-Diophantine sets, extending and improving several recent works. We also sharpen a classical estimate of Chung and Graham on even partial octahedrons in Paley sum hypergraphs.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 9 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Nicolas inequality we deal can be written as \begin{equation}\label{Nicineq} e^\gamma \log\log N_x < \dfrac{N_x}{\varphi(N_x)}\,, \end{equation} where $x\ge 2$, $N_x$ denotes the product of the primes less or equal than $x$, $\gamma$ is the Euler constant and $\varphi$ is the Euler totient function. We see that verification of such an inequality depends on the sign of the Big-o function in the Mertens estimate for the sum of reciprocals of primes that. Then we analyze the sign of such an error term.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 43 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study arithmetic finiteness of prime Fano threefolds of genus 7 and their higher dimensional generalization, called Mukai varieties of genus 7. For prime Fano threefolds of genus 7, we provide an arithmetic refinement of the Torelli theorem, obtain Shafarevich-type finiteness results, and show the failure of the N\'eron--Ogg--Shafarevich criterion of good reduction. For Mukai varieties of genus 7, we prove that Shafarevich-type finiteness results hold in dimensions 9 and 10, but fail in dimension 6. In addition, we show that Mukai $n$-folds of genus 7 over $\mathbb{Z}$ do not exist for $n \leq 4$, whereas they exist for $5 \leq n \leq 10$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/F$ be an elliptic curve defined over a number field $F$ with complex multiplication by the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic field $K$ such that the torsion points of $E$ generate over $F$ an abelian extension of $K$. In this paper we prove the $p$-part of the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer formula for $E/F$ in analytic rank $1$ for primes $p>3$ split in $K$. This was previously known for $F=\mathbb{Q}$ by work of Rubin as a consequence of his proof of Mazur's Main Conjecture for rational CM elliptic curves, but the problem for $[F:\mathbb{Q}]>1$ remained wide open. The approach introduced in this paper also yields a proof of similar results for CM abelian varieties $A/K$ and for CM modular forms, as well as an analogue in this setting of Skinner's $p$-converse to the theorem of Gross--Zagier and Kolyvagin.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a new Euler system for the Galois representation $V_{f,\chi}$ attached to a newform $f$ of weight $2r\geq 2$ twisted by an anticyclotomic Hecke character $\chi$. The Euler system is anticyclotomic in the sense of Jetchev-Nekovar-Skinner. We then show some arithmetic applications of the constructed Euler system, including new results on the Bloch-Kato conjecture in ranks zero and one, and a divisibility towards the Iwasawa-Greenberg main conjecture for $V_{f,\chi}$. In particular, in the case where the base-change of $f$ to our imaginary quadratic field has root number $+1$ and $\chi$ has higher weight (which implies that the complex $L$-function $L(V_{f,\chi},s)$ vanishes at the center), our results show that the Bloch-Kato Selmer group of $V_{f,\chi}$ is nonzero, as predicted by the Bloch-Kato conjecture; and if in addition a certain distinguished class $\kappa_{\,f,\chi}$ is nonzero, then the Selmer group is one-dimensional. Such applications to the Bloch-Kato conjecture for $V_{f,\chi}$ were left wide open by the earlier approaches using Heegner cycles and/or Beilinson-Flach elements. Our construction is based instead on a generalization of the Gross-Kudla-Schoen diagonal cycles.</p></details>

A class of functions, denoted $\tau_k(n)$, is defined as follows: $$q\prod_{m=1}^{\infty}(1-q^m)^k=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\tau_k(n)q^n, $$ where $k$ is an integer. We express $\tau_k(n)$ as a binomial coefficient weighted partition sum.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We attach Hecke polynomials $P_n(F;x)$ to weak Hecke eigenforms $F$ of weight $2-k$ and show that, for large $n$, every zero is simple, lies in $[0,1728]$, and the zeros equidistribute on this interval. The construction pulls back a weakly holomorphic Hecke combination of $F$ along $j$; the analysis follows Hecke orbits on the unit-circle arc $\mathcal{A}$, isolating a dominant "cosine" term and controlling the tail via Maass-Poincar\'e series and Whittaker/Bessel bounds. This extends the Rankin--Swinnerton-Dyer/Asai--Kaneko--Ninomiya picture from holomorphic forms to a broad class of harmonic Maass forms and yields a clean degree-monicity formula and simple criteria for zeros at $0$ and $1728$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Centralizer matrix algebras were investigated initially by Georg Ferdinand Frobenius in the Crelle's Journal around 1877. By introducing three new equivalence relations on all square matrices over a field, we completely characterize Morita, derived and almost $\nu$-stable derived equivalences between centralizer matrix algebras in terms of these matrix equivalences, respectively. Thus the categorical equivalences are reduced to matrix equivalences in linear algebra. Further, we show that a derived equivalence between centralizer matrix algebras of permutation matrices induces both a Morita equivalence and additional derived equivalences for $p$-regular parts and for $p$-singular parts. As applications, we show that the finitistic dimension conjecture and Nakayama conjecture are valid for centralizer matrix algebras.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 6 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent study of the quantum theory of harmonic oscillators, Gerard 't Hooft proposed the following problem: given $G(z)=\sum_{n>0}\sqrt{n}z^n$ for $|z|<1$, find its analytic continuation for $|z|\ge1$, excluding a branch-cut $z\in[1,\,\infty)$. A solution is provided by the bilateral convergent sum $G(z)=\frac12\sqrt{\pi}\sum_{n\in{\mathbb Z}}(2n\pi{\rm i}-\log(z))^{-3/2}$. On the negative real axis, $G(-e^u)$ has a sign-constant asymptotic expansion in $1/u^2$, for large positive $u$. Optimal truncation leaves exponentially suppressed terms in an asymptotic expansion $e^{-u}\sum_{k\ge0}P_k(x)/u^k$, with $P_0(x)=x-\frac23$ and $P_k(x)$ of degree $2k+1$ evaluated at $x=u/2-\lfloor u/2\rfloor$. These polynomials become excellent approximations to sinusoids. The amplitude of $P_k(x)$ increases factorially with $k$ and its phase increases linearly, with $P_k(x)\sim\sin((2k+1)C-2\pi x) R^{2k+1}\Gamma(k+\frac12)/\sqrt{2\pi}$, where $C\approx1.0688539158679530121571$ and $R\approx0.5181839789815558726739$ are asymptotic constants that have been determined at 100-digit precision. Their exact values remain to be identified. This work combines results from David C. Woods, on fractional polylogarithms, with evaluations of Hurwitz zeta values by Pari/GP.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We address the type I dichotomy for two-step nilpotent locally compact groups. Invoking work of Baggett-Kleppner, we characterize the closed points of the unitary dual of such a group $G$ purely in terms of the group structure. An algebraic criterion characterizing when $G$ is a type I group is derived. We show that this criterion automatically holds if $G$ is a central extension of vector groups over a non-discrete locally compact field $k$ such that the commutator map is $k$-bilinear. As an application, we show that the unipotent radicals of minimal parabolics in simple algebraic groups of $k$-rank one are type I groups. We also discuss the type I dichotomy for $p$-torsion contraction groups, and exhibit, for each prime $p$, uncountably many pairwise non-isomorphic such groups that are not type I. This answers a recently posed question by the second author. Finally, we adapt a recent construction of Chirvasitu to obtain numerous examples of two-step nilpotent torsion locally compact groups that are not type I, but that embed as closed cocompact normal subgroups in two-step nilpotent groups that are type I.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $N$ be a manifold of dimension $m$ with a flat vector bundle given by a representation $\rho:\pi_1(N) \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbf{R})$ where $\pi_1(N)$ is finitely generated. The holonomy group $\rho$ is a $k$-partially hyperbolic holonomy representation if the flat bundle pulled back over the unit tangent bundle of a sufficiently large compact submanifold of $N$ splits into expanding, neutral, and contracting subbundles along the geodesic flow, where the expanding and contracting subbundles are $k$-dimensional with $k < n/2$. Suppose that each element of $\rho(\pi_1(N))$ has an eigenvalue of norm $1$, or, alternatively, each element of it has a singular value that is uniformly bounded above and below. We show that $\rho$ is a $P$-Anosov representation for a parabolic subgroup $P$ of $\mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbf{R})$ if and only if $\rho$ is a partially hyperbolic representation. We are going to primarily employ representation theory techniques. As an application, we will show this holds when $N$ is a complete affine $n$-manifold and $\rho$ is a linear part of the holonomy representation. This had never been done over the full general linear group.</p></details>

We make no self-duality assumptions. The paper has two parts. In Part 1, we use $p$-arithmetic cohomology to unconditionally prove an automorphic exceptional zero conjecture in this setting, using Gehrmann's automorphic $\mathcal{L}$-invariant. In Part 2 we prove, under mild assumptions that are expected to always hold, the equality of automorphic and Fontaine--Mazur $\mathcal{L}$-invariants, and thus deduce cases of the full Greenberg--Benois exceptional zero conjecture. As one of the key ingredients for this, we establish local-global compatibility at $\ell = p$ for Galois representations attached to $p$-ordinary torsion classes for $\mathrm{GL}_n$, confirming a conjecture of Hansen in this setting. We prove this for all $n$ following the strategy in the "10-author paper", and use the $n=3$ case to deduce the desired equality of $\mathcal{L}$-invariants.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We say that two elliptic curves $E$ and $F$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ are congruent modulo a prime $p$ if their $p$-torsion Galois modules (over the algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Q}$) are isomorphic. Such a congruence is called trivial if there is a rational isogeny between $E$ and $F$ with degree prime to $p$. A version of the Frey-Mazur conjecture states that any congruence modulo any prime $p \geq 19$ is trivial. Given an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ and a prime $p$, it is well-known that there is a twist of the classical modular curve $X(p)$ whose rational points describe the elliptic curves congruent to $E$ modulo $p$. In this article, we apply Mazur's strategy to determine the rational points of such a twisted modular curve under certain assumptions. This involves, among others, the determination of the previously unknown Tate module of its Jacobian and new instances of the Birch and Swinnerton--Dyer conjecture (for abelian varieties not of $\mathrm{GL}_2$-type). In particular, we determine an explicit bound on the conductor of any elliptic curve congruent modulo $p$ to $y^2=x^3-p$ when $p$ is prime and congruent to $5$ modulo $9$, and deduce that any congruence modulo $23$ to $y^2=x^3-23$ is trivial.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a finite, abelian, CM extension $H/F$ of a totally real number field $F$, and construct a $\mathbb{Z}_p[[G(H_\infty/F)]]-$module $\nabla_S^T(H_\infty)_p$, where $p>2$ is a prime and $H_\infty$ is the cyclotomic $\Bbb Z_p$-extension of $H$. This is the Iwasawa theoretic analogue of a module introduced by Ritter and Weiss in \cite{Ritter-Weiss} and studied further by Dasgupta and Kakde in \cite{Dasgupta-Kakde}. Our main result states that the $\Bbb Z_p[[G(H_\infty/F]]^-$-module $\nabla_S^T(H_\infty)_p$ is of projective dimension $1$, is quadratically presented, and that its Fitting ideal is principal, generated by an equivariant $p$-adic $L$-function $\Theta_S^T(H_\infty/F)$. As a first application, we compute the Fitting ideal of an arithmetically interesting $\Bbb Z_p[[G(H_\infty/F)]]^-$-module $X_S^{T,-}$, which is a variant of the classical unramified Iwasawa module $X$ (the Galois group of the maximal abelian, unramified, pro-$p$ extension of $H_\infty$), extending earlier results of Greither-Kataoka-Kurihara \cite{Greither-Kataoka-Kurihara}. These are all instances of what is now called an Equivariant Main Conjecture in the Iwasawa theory of totally real number fields, and refine the classical main conjecture, proved by Wiles in \cite{wiles}. As a final application, we give a short, Iwasawa theoretic proof of the minus $p$-part of the far-reaching Equivariant Tamagawa Number Conjecture for the Artin motive $h_{H/F}$, for all primes $p>2$, a result also obtained, independently and with different (Euler system) methods, by Bullack-Burns-Daoud-Seo \cite{Bullach-Burns-Daoud-Seo} and Dasgupta-Kakde-Silliman \cite{Dasgupta-Kakde-Silliman-ETNC}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that Shimura varieties and geometric period images satisfy a $p$-adic extension property for large enough primes $p$. More precisely, let $\mathsf{D}^{\times}\subset \mathsf{D}$ denote the inclusion of the closed punctured unit disc in the closed unit disc. Let $X$ be either a Shimura variety or a geometric period image with torsion-free level structure. Let $F$ be a discretely valued $p$-adic field containing the number field of definition of $X$, where $p$ is a large enough prime. Then, any rigid-analytic map $f: (\mathsf{D}^{\times})^a \times \mathsf{D}^b \rightarrow X_F^{\textrm{an}}$ defined over $F$ whose image intersects the good reduction locus of $X_F^{\textrm{an}}$ (with respect to an integral canonical model) extends to a map $\mathsf{D}^{a+b}\rightarrow X_F^{\textrm{an}}$. We note that this hypothesis is vacuous if $X$ is proper. We also deduce an application to algebraicity of rigid-analytic maps. Our methods also apply to the more general situation of the rigid generic fiber of formal schemes admitting Fontaine-Laffaile modules which satisfy certain positivity conditions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By a theorem of Edrei, an infinite, normalised totally nonnegative upper-triangular Toeplitz matrices is determined by a pair of nonnegative parameter sequences, the `Schoenberg parameters', where nonzero parameters correspond to the roots and poles of a naturally associated generating function. These totally nonnegative Toeplitz matrices and their parameters also arise in the classification of characters of the infinite symmetric group by later work of Thoma. Moreover the Schoenberg parameters have an asymptotic interpretation in terms of irreducible representations of S_n and their Young diagrams by Vershik-Kerov. In this article we consider infinite totally positive Toeplitz matrices as limits of finite ones, and we obtain two further asymptotic descriptions of the Schoenberg parameters that are now related to quantum cohomology of the flag variety as n goes to infinity. One is related to asymptotics of normalised quantum parameters, and the other to asymptotics of the Chern classes of the tautological line bundles. We also describe the asymptotics of (quantum) Schubert classes in terms of the Schoenberg parameters. Our limit formulas relate to and were motivated by a tropical analogue of this theory that we survey. In the tropical setting one finds an asymptotic relationship between the `tropical Schoenberg parameters' and the weight map from Lusztig's parametrisation of the canonical basis.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a natural enlargement of the BGG Category O for a semisimple Lie algebra: the category of weight modules with trivial central character and finite-dimensional weight spaces supported on the root lattice. We give a geometric realization of this category as unipotently monodromic sheaves on the flag variety satisfying a singular support condition. We then explain that a derived version $\mathcal{D}$ of this category is Koszul dual to the Kazhdan-Laumon Category O, a different enlargement of the BGG Category O obtained from a gluing construction for sheaves on the flag variety. This characterizes $\mathcal{D}$ as the category of algebras over a natural monad on a direct sum of copies of the derived Category O. These results give new interpretations of certain classical algebraic constructions of weight modules over semisimple Lie algebras due to Fernando and Mathieu. We also conjecture that our results fit naturally into a proposed Koszul duality relating the small quantum group and the semi-infinite flag variety to the geometry of affine Springer fibers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a Witt--Hadamard calculus for Euler products that unifies the classical Gauss congruences with their modern refinement, the Dold congruences. Within this framework we prove \emph{norm descent}: Dold congruences are functorial under finite extensions and preserved by prime--ideal norms $N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}$, yielding integer ghosts from algebraic ones. We extend the theory from $\mathbb{Z}$ to Dedekind domains, and show that integrality is stable under both Hadamard and Witt products. Two rigidity theorems lie at the core: a \emph{cyclotomic residues theorem}, asserting that if the logarithmic derivative has only cyclotomic poles then integrality forces rationality; and a stronger \emph{Dold$^{+}$ rigidity theorem}, showing that any algebraic series satisfying refined Dold congruences is necessarily rational. These results sharpen the Gauss--Dold picture: ordinary congruences enforce integrality, while the strengthened form collapses algebraic cases to rational ones. Applications include prime--ideal ladders in number fields and exact product laws for dynamical zeta functions, illustrated for subshifts of finite type and circle doubling.</p></details>

Solving a 2001 problem of S\'ark\"ozy on special sequences, Hegyv\'ari proved in 2003 that there exists an infinite sequence $A$ with density $\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{k\alpha}$ such that $$ \big\{f(a_1)+\ldots+f(a_k): a_i\in A, 1\le i\le k\big\}\cap \big\{\lfloor n\alpha\rfloor: n\in \mathbb{N}\big\}=\emptyset. $$ Hegyv\'ari also proved that the density given by him is optimal for $k=2$. In this article, we show that the density $\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{k\alpha}$ given by Hegyv\'ari is actually optimal for all $k\ge 2$. The proof will follow from a modular version of the Brunn-Minkowski inequality established here.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>On one hand, exact structures were introduced by D. Quillen in the '70s. They can be defined as collections of short exact sequences in a fixed abelian category satisfying additional properties. On the other hand, in a recent work, A. Garver, R. Patrias, and H. Thomas introduced Jordan recoverability. Given a bounded quiver $(Q,R)$, a full additive subcategory of $\mathrm{rep}(Q,R)$ is said to be Jordan recoverable if any $X \in \mathscr{C}$ can be recovered, up to isomorphism, from the Jordan form of its generic nilpotent endomorphisms. Such a subcategory $\mathscr{C}$ is said to be canonically Jordan recoverable if, moreover, there exists a precise algebraic procedure that allows one to get back $X \in \mathscr{C}$ from that same Jordan form data. We introduce a new family of operators, called Gen-Sub operators $\mathrm{GS}_\mathcal{E}$, parametrized by the exact structures $\mathcal{E}$ of abelian categories. After showing some properties of those operators in hereditary abelian categories, by focusing on the setting of modules over type $A$ quivers endowed with the diamond exact structure $\mathcal{E}_\diamond$, we establish that the maximal canonically Jordan recoverable subcategories are precisely of the form $\mathrm{GS}_{\mathcal{E}_\diamond}(T)$ for some tilting object $T$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a universal construction of Diophantine equations with bounded complexity in Isabelle/HOL. This is a formalization of our own work in number theory. Hilbert's Tenth Problem was answered negatively by Yuri Matiyasevich, who showed that there is no general algorithm to decide whether an arbitrary Diophantine equation has a solution. However, the problem remains open when generalized to the field of rational numbers, or contrarily, when restricted to Diophantine equations with bounded complexity, characterized by the number of variables $\nu$ and the degree $\delta$. If every Diophantine set can be represented within the bounds $(\nu, \delta)$, we say that this pair is universal, and it follows that the corresponding class of equations is undecidable. In a separate mathematics article, we have determined the first non-trivial universal pair for the case of integer unknowns. In this paper, we contribute a formal verification of the main construction required to establish said universal pair. In doing so, we markedly extend the Isabelle AFP entry on multivariate polynomials, formalize parts of a number theory textbook, and develop classical theory on Diophantine equations in Isabelle. Additionally, our work includes metaprogramming infrastructure designed to efficiently handle complex definitions of multivariate polynomials. Our mathematical draft has been formalized while the mathematical research was ongoing, and benefitted largely from the help of the theorem prover. We reflect how the close collaboration between mathematician and computer is an uncommon but promising modus operandi.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In \cite{Broer1993}, it was shown that certain line bundles on $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}}=T^*G/B$ have vanishing higher cohomology. We prove a generalization of this theorem for real reductive algebraic groups. More specifically, if $\mathcal{N}_\theta$ denotes the cone of nilpotent elements in a Cartan subspace $\mathfrak{p},$ we have a similar construction of a resolution of singularities $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}.$ We prove that for a certain cone of weights $H^i(\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta},\mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}}(\lambda))=0$ for $i> 0.$ This follows by combining a simple calculation of the canonical bundle for $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}$ with Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing. Restricting to the structure sheaf, we get a characterization of the singularities of the normalization of $\mathcal{N}_\theta.$ We use this to show that for groups of QCT (Definition 2), $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{N}_\theta]$ is equivalent as a $K$-representation to a certain cohomologically induced module giving a new proof of a result in \cite{KostantRallis1971}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a Riemannian manifold $M$ and an $L^2$-normalized Laplacian eigenfunction $\psi$ on $M$ with eigenvalue $\lambda^2$, a general problem in analysis is to understand how the mass of $\psi$ distributes around $M$. There are different ways to attack this problem. One of them is to analyze the $L^p$-norm of $\psi$ restricted to a submanifold of $M$. Here, we concentrate on the case $M=S^2$, $p=2$, and we restrict to geodesics of the sphere. Burq, G\'erard, and Tzvetkov showed, for $\gamma$ a geodesic of $S^2$ (and indeed for more general surfaces), that $||\psi|_{\gamma}||_{L^2} \ll \lambda^{1/4}$ and that this bound is optimal in general. In this paper, we specialize to the case in which $\psi$ is an eigenfunction of all the Hecke operators on the sphere and consider the set of geodesics $\mathcal{C}_{D}$ of $S^2$ associated to fundamental discriminants $D<0$. By combining approaches of Ali and Magee, we improve the previous upper bound to $||\psi|_{\mathcal{C}_{D}}||_{L^2} \ll_{D,\varepsilon} \lambda^{\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon>0$, which is essentially sharp.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, motivated by studying special values of zeta functions attached to finite type F_p-schemes, we introduce a category of ``arithmetic C(S^1,R)-modules'' attached to any Dedekind ring R, and compute the 0th K-group of this category. Specializing to the case of R=Z_l for some prime l neq p (resp. R=Z_p), we prove that there is a natural functorial lift of the etale cohomology of perfect etale Z_l sheaves (resp. syntomic cohomology of perfect prismatic F-gauges) on a point to arithmetic C(S^1,Z_l)-modules (resp. arithmetic C(S^1,Z_p)-modules). This allows us to define a notion of the multiplicative Euler characteristic via a map from the K_0-group which makes sense without assuming Tate's semi-simplicity conjecture. In particular, we can remove this hypothesis from a theorem of Milne proving a cohomological formula for zeta values attached to smooth proper F_p-schemes. We also discuss extensions of these zeta value formulae to finite type F_p-schemes, and how recent progress in motivic homotopy theory allows us to prove some results without any assumptions on resolution of singularities or Tate's semi-simplicity conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use functorial methods to define and study $0$-abelian categories, which we propose to be the case $n = 0$ of Jasso's $n$-abelian categories. In particular, we define a bifunctor for $0$-abelian categories with enough injectives or projectives, which is analogous to the extension bifunctor for an abelian category. We prove a few results concerning this bifunctor, including $0$-abelian versions of the long exact sequence involving the extension bifunctors, of a conjecture due to Auslander on the direct summands of the extension functors, and of the Hilton-Rees theorem. These results are then applied to the study of the stable categories of a $0$-abelian category, and a similar discussion is carried out for the stable categories of an abelian category. Moreover, by specializing our results to modules over rings, we show that $0$-abelian categories with additive generators are in correspondence with semi-hereditary rings. We present applications to these rings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Buan, Iyama, Reiten and Smith proved that cluster-tilting objects in triangulated 2-Calabi--Yau categories are closely connected with mutation of quivers with potentials over an algebraically closed field. We prove a more general statement where instead of working with quivers with potentials we consider species with potential over a perfect field. We describe the $3$-preprojective algebra of the tensor product of two tensor algebras of acyclic species using a species with potential. In the case when the Jacobian algebra of a species with potential is self-injective, we provide a description of the Nakayama automorphism of a particular case of mutation of the species with potential where you mutate along orbits of the Nakayama permutation, which preserves self-injectivity. For certain types of Jacobian algebras of species with potentials, we prove that they lie in the scope of the derived Auslander-Iyama correspondence due to Jasso-Muro. Mutating along orbits of the Nakayama permutation stays within this setting, yielding a rich source of examples. All $2$-representation finite $l$-homogeneous algebras that are constructed using certain species with potential and mutations of such species with potentials are considered.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 33 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The canonical dimension is an invariant attached to admissible representations of p-adic reductive groups, which has only received significant attention in the case of mod-p representations. In the case of complex representations, the canonical dimension is closely related to the wavefront set. We find a new lower bound for the canonical dimension of a general compactly induced representation over an arbitrary coefficient field. This lower bound is uniform in the sense that it only depends on the group and not on the representation itself. In many cases, this provides a lower bound for the canonical dimension of supercuspidal representations and in the complex case we get a lower bound for the corresponding wavefront set. In order to obtain this result, we first generalize a result on the asymptotic growth of the cardinality of balls in the Bruhat-Tits building to the case of exceptional types.</p></details>

> **Comment:** We introduce the Good Ramanujan Expansions: with good decay for coefficients, studying the consequences

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this self-contained short note, we introduce the new definition of Good Ramanujan Expansion, say G.R.E., for a fixed arithmetic function $F$, building upon a good decay of its coefficients $G$; this, gains $\log-$powers w.r.t. the trivial bound for $G$ and precisely $\log^{1+\eta}$, where the present parameter $\eta>0$ is real. This property alone has important consequences for all the $F$ having a G.R.E. : mainly, 1) the Eratosthenes Transform $F'$ of our $F$ is infinitesimal (see in Theorem 1); 2) when $\eta>1$ (an enhanced decay) we have uniqueness of $G$ (actually, these are the classic Wintner-Carmichael coefficients, see Th.2); 3) we get a bound for $F$ (in Th.3); 4) an important new class of arithmetic functions $F$ can't have a G.R.E. (see Th.4). These are a generalization of Correlations; which in this way, if are, say, a kind of "far from constants", may not have a G.R.E., whence, a fortiori, can't have the R.E.E.F. This is the Ramanujan Exact Explicit Formula, that we introduced with Prof. Ram Murty.</p></details>

In analogy with Grothendieck-Malcev's results for discrete groups, we show that if a morphism $f \colon Y \to X$ of smooth projective varieties over $k=\bar{k}$ induces a surjection on the \'etale fundamental groups, then the pullback functor ${\rm Fdiv}(X)\to {\rm Fdiv}(Y)$ is fully faithful. If $f$ is surjective and the induced map is an isomorphism, then the functor is an equivalence. These results extend the theorem of Esnault-Mehta on the triviality of $F$-divided sheaves over simply connected varieties.</p></details>

A key result shows that, under certain conditions, a quasi-projective (respectively quasi-injective) S-act that is strongly co-Hopfian (respectively strongly Hopfian) is also strongly Hopfian (respectively strongly co-Hopfian). Moreover, we provide a variety of examples and structural results concerning the behavior of subacts and quotient acts of strongly Hopfian and strongly co-Hopfian S-acts, further elucidating the internal structure and interrelationships within this extended framework.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a descent monomial basis of $\Delta$-Springer modules $R_{n,\lambda,s}$, first defined by Griffin. Our construction simultaneously generalizes the descent basis for the Garsia-Procesi module $R_\lambda$ studied by Carlsson-Chou and Hanada, as well as the descent basis for the generalized coinvariant algebras $R_{n,k}$ studied by Haglund-Rhoades-Shimozono. This basis is deeply connected with a combinatorial object called battery-powered tableaux, introduced by Gillespie-Griffin. We highlight the representation theoretic properties of this monomial basis by using it to give a direct combinatorial proof of the graded Frobenius character of $R_{n,\lambda,s}$ in terms of battery-powered tableaux, a fact which has only the geometric proof of Gillespie-Griffin. We also conjecture a higher Specht basis of $R_{n,\lambda,s}$, generalizing the higher Specht basis of the coinvariant ring defined in Ariki-Terasoma-Yamada. This construction coincides with the Gillespie-Rhoades higher Specht basis for $R_{n,k}$. We give a proof for when $\lambda = (\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ is a partition of two rows.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A Bass order is an order of a number field whose fractional ideals are generated by two elements. The majority of number fields contain infinitely many Bass orders. For example, any order of a number field which contains the maximal order of a subfield with degree 2 or whose discriminant is fourth-power-free in $\mathbb{Z}$, is a Bass order. In this paper, we will propose a closed formula for the number of fractional ideals of a Bass order $R$, up to its invertible ideals, using the conductor of $R$. Since $R$ is a Bass order, this is the same as the number of overorders of $R$. We will also explain the explicit enumeration of all orders containing $R$. Our method is based on the local-global argument and the exhaustion argument, using orbital integrals for $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ as a mass formula.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We formulate a conjecture on the finitude of rationality fields (i.e., Fourier coefficient fields) of newforms of bounded degree, and prove this for CM forms assuming a generalized Riemann hypothesis. Then we explicitly determine what quadratic and cubic rationality fields occur for weight 2 CM forms, which is related to classifications of CM abelian varieties of GL(2) type. Several of these fields do not appear in the existing tables of newforms in the LMFDB.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an integer \( k \geq 2 \), the sequence of \( k \)-generalized Lucas numbers is defined by the recurrence relation \( L_n^{(k)} = L_{n-1}^{(k)} + \cdots + L_{n-k}^{(k)} \) for all \( n \geq 2 \), with initial conditions \( L_0^{(k)} = 2 \), \( L_1^{(k)} = 1 \) for all \( k \geq 2 \), and \( L_{2-k}^{(k)} = \cdots = L_{-1}^{(k)} = 0 \) for \( k \geq 3 \). In this paper, we determine all \( k \)-generalized Lucas numbers that are concatenations of two terms of the same sequence and completely solve this problem for \( k \geq 3 \). Our approach combines nonzero lower bounds for linear forms in logarithms, reduction techniques based on the Baker--Davenport method and the LLL-algorithm, together with continued fraction analysis and computational verification using SageMath.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite group $G$ and positive integer $g$, a $g$-additive basis is a subset of $G$ whose pairwise sums cover each element of $G$ at least $g$ times, with $g$-difference bases defined similarly using pairwise differences. While prior work focused on $1$-additive and $1$-difference bases, recent works of Kravitz and Schmutz--Tait explored $g$-additive and $g$-difference bases in finite abelian groups. This paper investigates such bases in $G^n$, the Cartesian product of a finite abelian group $G$. We construct $g$-additive and $g$-difference bases in $G^n$, which lead to asymptotically sharp upper bounds on the minimal sizes of such bases. Our proofs draw on ideas from additive combinatorics and combinatorial design theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any JdLG-admissible representation $\pi$ of a semigroup $S$, we show that the reversible part is weakly equivalent to a unitary representation on a Hilbert space that decomposes into a direct sum of finite dimensional representations, and we give an alternative characterization of the almost weakly stable part in terms of the unique invariant mean on the space of weakly almost periodic functions. In the case that $S$ is a bi-amenable measured semigroup, we characterize the almost weakly stable part using invariant means and averages along F\o lner sequences. Moreover, we give a description of the unique projection onto the reversible part whose kernel is the almost weakly stable part in terms of ultrafilters.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a globally generic cuspidal automorphic representation $\mathit{\Pi}$ of a quasi-split reductive group $G$ over $\mathbb Q$, E. Lapid and Z. Mao proposed a conjecture on the decomposition of the global Whittaker functionals on $\mathit{\Pi}$ into products of an adjoint $L$-value of $\mathit{\Pi}$ and the local Whittaker functionals. In this paper, we consider the algebraic aspect of the Lapid-Mao conjecture. More precisely, when $\mathit{\Pi}$ is $C$-algebraic, we show that the algebraicity of the adjoint $L$-value can be expressed in terms of the Petersson norm of Whittaker-rational cusp forms in $\mathit{\Pi}$, subject to the validity of the Lapid-Mao conjecture. For unitary similitude groups, we also establish an unconditional and more refined algebraicity result. Additionally, we give an explicit formula for the case $G={\rm U}(2,1)$.</p></details>
