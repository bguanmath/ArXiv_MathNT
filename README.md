 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Christian Dean, Haley Havard, Elizabeth Hawkins, Patch Heard, Andrew Lott, Alex Rice &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 10 pages, 5 tables

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We explore from several perspectives the following question: given $X\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ and $N\in \mathbb{N}$, what is the maximum size $D(X,N)$ of $A\subseteq \{1,2,\dots,N\}$ before $A$ is forced to contain two distinct elements that differ by an element of $X$? The set of forbidden differences, $X$, is called \textit{intersective} if $D(X,N)=o(N)$, with the most well-studied examples being $X=S=\{n^2: n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ and $X=\mathcal{P}-1=\{p-1: p\text{ prime}\}$. In addition to some new results, including exact formulas and estimates for $D(X,N)$ in some non-intersective cases like $X=\mathcal{P}$ and $X=S+k$, $k\in \mathbb{N}$, we also provide a comprehensive survey of known bounds and extensive computational data. In particular, we utilize an existing algorithm for finding maximum cliques in graphs to determine $D(S,N)$ for $N\leq 300$ and $D(\mathcal{P}-1,N)$ for $N\leq 500$. None of these exact values appear previously in the literature.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 19 pages. V2: Added Section 4 "RQ-lattices". Minor changes. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.10301 by other authors

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. Let $R$ be a local commutative finite dimensional $k$-algebra and let $Q$ be a quiver with no loops or oriented cycles. We show that mutation of $\tau$-exceptional sequences over $\Lambda = R\otimes_k kQ \cong RQ$ in the sense of Buan, Hanson, and Marsh coincides with the classical mutation of exceptional sequences defined by Crawley-Boevey and Ringel. In particular, the braid group acts transitively on the set of complete $\tau$-exceptional sequences in $\text{mod }{\Lambda}$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sarah Arpin, Stefano Marseglia, Caleb Springer &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Famously, Kohel proved that isogeny graphs of ordinary elliptic curves are beautifully structured objects, now called volcanos. We prove graph structural theorems for abelian varieties of any dimension with commutative endomorphism ring and containing a fixed locally Bass order, leveraging an ideal-theoretic perspective on isogeny graphs. This generalizes previous results, which relied on restrictive additional assumptions, such as maximal real multiplication, ordinary, and absolutely simple (Brooks, Jetchev, Wesolowski 2017). In particular, our work also applies to non-simple and non-ordinary isogeny classes. To obtain our results, we first prove a structure theorem for the lattice of inclusion of the overorders of a locally Bass order in an \'etale algebra which is of independent interest. This analysis builds on a careful study of local singularities of the orders. We include several examples of volcanoes and isogeny graphs exhibiting unexpected properties ultimately due to our more general setting.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zheng Hua, Alexander Polishchuk &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** In this version, we corrected an error in the old Theorem 3.2.1. It is now replaced by the new Theorem 3.2.2. The Feigin-Odesskii bracket and the standard bracket should differ by a twist by a bivector fields on the maximal torus

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a link between open positroid varieties in the Grassmannians $G(k,n)$ and certain moduli spaces of complexes of vector bundles over Kodaira cycle $C^n$, using the shifted Poisson structure on the latter moduli spaces and relating them to a certain twist of the standard Poisson structure on $G(k,n)$. %by a bivector field on its maximal torus. This link allows us to solve a classification problem for extensions of vector bundles over $C^n$. Based on this solution we further classify the symplectic leaves of all positroid varieties in $G(k,n)$ with respect to the twisted standard Poisson structure. Moreover, we get an explicit description of the moduli stack of symplectic leaves of $G(k,n)$ with the twisted standard Poisson structure as an open substack of the stack of vector bundles on $C^n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In his paper on the Mordell-Lang conjecture, Hrushovski employed techniques from model theory to prove the function field version of the conjecture. In doing so he was able to answer a related question of Voloch, which we refer to henceforth as Hrushovski's theorem. In this paper we shall give an alternative proof of said theorem in the characteristic $p$ setting, but using purely algebro-geometric ideas.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Akinari Hoshi, Aiichi Yamasaki &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a complete answer to the rationality problem (up to stable $k$-equivalence) for norm one tori $T=R^{(1)}_{K/k}(\mathbb{G}_m)$ of $K/k$ whose Galois closures $L/k$ are $A_5\simeq {\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_4)$ and ${\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_8)$ extensions. In particular, we prove that $T$ is stably $k$-rational for $G={\rm Gal}(L/k)\simeq {\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{8})$, $H={\rm Gal}(L/K)\simeq (C_2)^3$ and $H\simeq (C_2)^3\rtimes C_7$ where $C_n$ is the cyclic group of order $n$ by using GAP computations with the aid of PARI/GP. Based on the result, we conjecture that $T$ is stably $k$-rational for $G\simeq {\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{2^d})$, $(C_2)^d\leq H\leq (C_2)^d\rtimes C_{2^d-1}$. Some other cases $G\simeq A_n$, $S_n$, ${\rm GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$, ${\rm SL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$, ${\rm PGL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$, ${\rm PSL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$ and $H\lneq G$ are also investigated for small $n$ and $p^d$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yubin He &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The mass transference principle of Beresnevich and Velani is a powerful mechanism for determining the Hausdorff dimension/measure of $\limsup$ sets that arise naturally in Diophantine approximation. However, in the setting of dynamical Diophantine approximation, this principle often fails to apply effectively, as the radii of the balls defining the dynamical $\limsup$ sets generally depend on the orbit of the point $x$ itself. In this paper, we develop a dimensional mass transference principle that enables us to recover and extend classical results on shrinking target problems, particularly for the $\beta$-transformation and the Gauss map. Moreover, our result shows that the corresponding $\limsup$ sets have large intersection properties. A potentially interesting feature of our method is that, in many cases, shrinking target problems are closely related to finding an appropriate Gibbs measure, which may reveal new aspects of the link between thermodynamic formalism and dynamical Diophantine approximation.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** N. K. Meher &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** This is the first draft of the paper. Any comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Nadji, Ahmia and Ram\'{i}rez \cite{Nadji2025} investigate the arithmetic properties of ${\bar B}_{\ell_1,\ell_2}(n)$, the number of overpartitions where no part is divisible by $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ with $\gcd(\ell_1,\ell_2)$$=1$ and $\ell_1$,$\ell_2$$>1$. Specifically, they established congruences modulo $3$ and powers of $2$ for the pairs of $(\ell_1,\ell_2)$$\in$$\{(4,3),(4,9),(8,3),(8,9)\}$, using the concept of generating functions, dissection formulas and Smoot's implementation of Radu's Ramanujan-Kolberg algorithm. After that, Alanazi, Munagi and Saikia \cite{Alanazi2024} studied and found some congruences for the pairs of $(\ell_1,\ell_2)\in\{(2,3),(4,3),(2,5),(3,5),(4,9),(8,27),\\(16,81)\} $ using the theory of modular forms and Radu's algorithm. Recently Paudel, Sellers and Wang \cite{Paudel2025} extended several of their results and established infinitely many families of new congruences. In this paper, we find infinitely many families of congruences modulo $3$ and powers of $2$ for the pairs $(\ell_1,\ell_2)$ $ \in$ $\{(2,9),(5,2),(5,4),(8,3)\}$ and in general for $ (5,2^t)$ $\forall t\geq3$ and for $ (3,2^t)$,$ (4,3^t)$ $\forall t\geq2$, using the theory of Hecke eigenform, an identity due to Newman and the concept of dissection formulas and generating functions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Vefa Goksel &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 17 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix a prime number $d$. The post-critically finite polynomials of the form $f_{d,c} = x^d+c\in \mathbb{C}[x]$ play a fundamental role in polynomial dynamics. While many results are known in the complex dynamical setting, much less is understood about the arithmetic properties of these polynomials. In this paper, we describe the factorization of the iterates of post-critically finite polynomials $f_{d,c}$ over their fields of definition. As a consequence, we prove new cases of a conjecture of Andrews and Petsche on abelian arboreal Galois representations.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Minor improvements, Assumption removed

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article generalizes Venkatesh's structure theorem for the derived Hecke action on the Hecke trivial cohomology of a division algebra over an imaginary quadratic field to division algebras over all number fields. In particular, we show that the stable submodule of the Hecke trivial cohomology attached to a division algebra is a free module generated by the unit class for the action of the strict derived Hecke algebra. Moreover, the strict derived Hecke algebra possesses a rational form that preserves the canonical rational structure on the stable cohomology during the derived Hecke action. The main ingredients in our improvement are a careful study of the congruence classes in the torsion cohomology of the arithmetic manifold and the author's new result on the reduction map in the $K$-theory of the ring of integers in number fields.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 27 pages. v2:expositions improved

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The authors define a Category $\mathcal{O}$ for any quasi-reductive Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with respect to a triangular decomposition. This much needed approach unifies many important constructions in the existing literature in a rigorous fashion. Our Category $\mathcal{O}$ encompasses all highest weight categories for Lie (super)algebras as well as specific examples which may not be highest weight categories. When the decomposition arises from a principal parabolic subalgebra $\mathfrak{p}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$, the Category $\mathcal{O}$ exhibits rich homological properties. For one, the authors show that in contrast to the case of a semisimple Lie algebra, the Category $\mathcal{O}$ is standardly stratified. Moreover, the categorical cohomology of $\mathcal{O}$ is a finitely generated ring. This provides a first step towards developing a support variety theory for Category $\mathcal{O}$. Finally, it is shown that the complexity of modules in Category $\mathcal{O}$ is finite with an explicit upper bound given by the dimension of the subspace of the odd degree elements in $\mathfrak{g}$. This upgrades results known for $\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$ to the more general setting. Our arguments are based on foundational connections between the categorical cohomology and the relative Lie superalgebra cohomology as well as the interplay between Category $\mathcal{O}$ for $\mathfrak{g}$ and the Category $\mathcal{O}$ for its corresponding Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_{\bar 0}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 24 pages, 25 figures; final version accepted to Adv. Math

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The general linear group $GL_{n}$, along with its adjoint simple group $PGL_n$, can be described by means of weighted planar networks. In this paper we give a network description for simple Lie groups of types $B$ and $C$. The corresponding networks are axially symmetric modulo a sequence of cluster mutations along the axis of symmetry. We extend to this setting the result of Gekhtman, Shapiro, and Vainshtein on the Poisson property of Postnikov's boundary measurement map. We also show that $B$ and $C$ type networks with positive weights parametrize the totally nonnegative part of the respective group. Finally, we construct network parametrizations of double Bruhat cells in symplectic and odd-dimensional orthogonal groups, and identify the corresponding face weights with Fock-Goncharov cluster coordinates.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We fix a prime p and construct new cases of pro-p extensions of number fields with restricted ramification and splitting, whose Galois groups decompose as coproducts of pro-p absolute Galois groups of local fields. As a consequence, these pro-p extensions satisfy the strong Massey vanishing property and thus admit large unipotent quotients.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages. Title change, added '0.2. Some useful results', included Lemma 1.2 and fixed some minor corrections. Accepted for publication in Publicacions Matem\'atiques

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct Nakayama functors on proper abelian subcategories of triangulated categories with a Serre functor using approximation theory. This, in turn, allows for the construction of Auslander-Reiten translates. As a result, we prove that suitable proper abelian subcategories are dualising $k$-varieties and have enough projectives if and only if they have enough injectives. As an application, we provide a new proof of the existence of Auslander-Reiten sequences in the category of finite dimensional modules over a finite dimensional algebra.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 55 pages, to appear in Advanced Studies in Pure Mathematics

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose new vertex operators, both the type I and the type II dual, of the elliptic quantum toroidal algebra U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}) by combining representations of U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}) and the notions of the elliptic stable envelopes for the instanton moduli space M(n,r). The vertex operators reproduce the shuffle product formula of the elliptic stable envelopes by their composition. We also show that the vacuum expectation value of a composition of the vertex operators gives a correct formula of the K-theoretic vertex function for M(n,r). We then derive exchange relations among the vertex operators and construct a L-operator satisfying the RLL=LLR^* relation with R and R^* being elliptic dynamical instanton R-matrices defined as transition matrices of the elliptic stable envelopes. Assuming a universal form of L, we define a comultiplication \Delta in terms of it. It turns out that the new vertex operators are intertwining operators of the U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor})-modules w.r.t \Delta.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 26 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Macdonald's ninth variation of Schur functions is a broad generalization of the classical Schur function and its variants, defined via the Jacobi-Trudi determinant formula. In this paper, we establish various algebraic relations for $S^{(r)}_{\lambda/\mu}(X)$, a class of the ninth variation introduced by Nakagawa, Noumi, Shirakawa, and Yamada, by combining the Jacobi-Trudi formula with determinant formulas such as the Desnanot-Jacobi adjoint matrix theorem and the Pl\"ucker relations, which generalize the corresponding relations for Schur functions. As an application, we investigate algebraic relations for "diagonally constant" Schur multiple zeta functions and examine their specific special values when the shape is rectangular.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 11 pages , 2 tables

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper explores a theoretical approach to enhance RSA's resistance against quantum attacks by optimizing prime selection through R\'enyi entropy constraints. We develop a framework where primes are generated with controlled proximity ($|p-q| < \gamma\sqrt{pq}$) to minimize the collision entropy $\mathscr{H}_2$ of the quantum period-finding operator. The main contributions include: (1) establishing a connection between prime distribution properties and quantum attack complexity via Maynard's prime gap theorem, (2) providing a constructive proof for prime existence under entropy constraints, and (3) demonstrating security reduction to ideal lattice problems under the quantum random oracle model. Theoretical analysis suggests that for $k$-bit moduli with $\gamma < k^{-1/2+\epsilon}$, Shor's algorithm requires $\Omega(\gamma^{-1}k^{3/2})$ quantum operations while maintaining classical security equivalent to standard RSA. Key Enhancements: (1) Prime existence proof via Maynard's theorem (Theorem 3.1), (2) Ideal lattice embedding for SVP reduction (Theorem 5.3), (3) Quantum Fano bound for information-theoretic analysis (Theorem 6.3), (4) Multi-prime RSA extension (Section 7.3).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Two aspects on the important notion of pre-Lie algebras are pre-Lie bialgebras (or left-symmetric bialgebras) with motivation from para-K\"ahler Lie algebras, and Nijenhuis operators on pre-Lie algebras arising from their deformation theory. In this paper, we present a method to construct Nijenhuis operators on a pre-Lie algebras via pseudo-Hessian pre-Lie algebras. Next, we introduce the notion of Nijenhuis operators on pre-Lie coalgebras and give their constructions, one from a linearly compatible pre-Lie coalgebra structure, and one from pre-Lie bialgebras. We then obtain a bialgebraic structure on Nijenhuis pre-Lie algebras by using dual representations and study their relations with \sss-equations and $\mathcal{O}$-operators. Finally we prove that a Nijenhuis balanced pre-Lie bialgebra produces a Nijenhuis Lie bialgebra.</p></details>

First, for Szpiro's conjecture when the relevant elliptic curves are members of a one-parameter family (an elliptic surface). And secondly, for the problem of giving lower bounds for the greatest prime factor of polynomial values, in the case of quadratic and cubic polynomials.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In previous papers it has been shown that the coefficients of terms in the large-$N$ expansion of a certain integrated four-point correlator of superconformal primary operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory are rational sums of real-analytic Eisenstein series and "generalised Eisenstein series''. The latter are novel modular functions first encountered in the context of graviton amplitudes in type IIB superstring theory. Similar modular functions, known as two-loop modular graph functions, are also encountered in the low-energy expansion of the integrand of genus-one closed superstring amplitudes. In this paper we further develop the mathematical structure of such generalised Eisenstein series emphasising, in particular, the occurrence of $L$-values of holomorphic cusp forms in their Fourier mode decomposition. We show that both the coefficients in the large-$N$ expansion of the integrated correlator and two-loop modular graph functions admit a unifying description in terms of four-dimensional lattice sums generated by theta lifts of local Maass functions, which generalise the structure of real-analytic Eisenstein series. Through the theta lift representation, we demonstrate that elements belonging to these two families of non-holomorphic modular functions can be expressed as rational linear combinations of generalised Eisenstein series for which all the $L$-values of holomorphic cusp forms precisely cancel.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study central configurations when the set of positions is symmetric. We use a theorem from representation theory of finite groups to explore the symmetry properties of equations for central configurations. This approach simplifies equations for central configurations by considering arbitrary numbers of bodies, symmetry groups, and dimensions. We discuss how to use this theorem to obtain a more refined decomposition of the equations than that given before. The decomposition presented here uses the symmetry-adapted basis method. As an application, we give a complete description of the existence and which masses are possible for central configurations of two nested regular tetrahedrons, two nested regular octahedrons, and two nested regular cubes. To do this, we employ some methods of rational parameterizations and isolation of zeros of multivariate polynomials. The decomposition obtained allows symbolic calculations to be used to study the expressions. This way, we summarize previous discussions and extend them by completing the analysis on the cube case, for both the inverse and direct problems.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the average size of $\mathrm{Cl}_F[2]$ in the family of cubic fields $F = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{n})$. Specifically, as $F$ varies over the subfamily of wildly (resp. tamely) ramified fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{n})$, the average size of $\mathrm{Cl}_F[2]$ is $3/2$ (resp. $2$). This tame/wild dichotomy is not accounted for by the class group heuristics in the literature. Analogously, when the extensions $F = K(\sqrt[3]{n})$ of $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ are ordered by the norm of $n \in \mathcal{O}_K$, we show that the average size of $\mathrm{Cl}_F[2]$ is $3/2$, as is predicted by the Cohen--Martinet heuristics for $C_3$-extensions of $K$. Underlying our proofs is a reciprocity law for the relative class groups $\mathrm{Cl}_{F/K}[2]$ of odd degree extensions of number fields $F/K$. This leads us to propose class group heuristics for families of $K$-extensions with a fixed Galois $K$-group that explains the aberrant behavior in the family $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{n})$ and predicts similar behavior in other special families. The other main ingredient is the work of Alp\"oge--Bhargava--Shnidman on the number of integral $G(\mathbb{Q})$-orbits in a $G$-invariant quadric with bounded invariants.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An invertible matrix is called a Perron similarity if it diagonalizes an irreducible, nonnegative matrix. Each Perron similarity gives a nontrivial polyhedral cone, called the spectracone, and polytope, called the spectratope, of realizable spectra (thought of as vectors in complex Euclidean space). A Perron similarity is called ideal if its spectratope coincides with the conical hulls of its rows. Identifying ideal Perron similarities is of great interest in the pursuit of the longstanding nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem. In this work, it is shown that the character table of a finite group is an ideal Perron similarity. In addition to expanding ideal Perron similarities to include a broad class of matrices, the results unify previous works into a single, theoretical framework. It is demonstrated that the spectracone can be described by finitely-many group-theoretic inequalities. When the character table is real, we derive a group-theoretic formula for the volume of the projected Perron spectratope, which is a simplex. Finally, an implication for further research is given.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel class of prime-generating quadratic polynomials defined by $f_{Z,k,H}(n) = n^2 - (2Zk - 1)n + \frac{(2Zk - 1)^2 + H}{4}$, where $Zk \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ and $H$ belongs to the set of Heegner numbers. This form is closely related to the Euler-Rabinowitsch polynomials through specific substitutions. The structure enables algebraic tuning for prime-rich outputs and provides deeper insight into the impact of Heegner numbers on prime distribution. Using tools such as the Bateman-Horn conjecture and prime-counting functions, we demonstrate that this family can be optimized to generate a high density of primes. This work offers new directions for research in analytic number theory and potential applications in cryptography and signal processing.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The motivic coaction of multiple zeta values and multiple polylogarithms encodes both structural insights on and computational methods for scattering amplitudes in a variety of quantum field theories and in string theory. In this work, we propose coaction formulae for iterated integrals over holomorphic Eisenstein series that arise from configuration-space integrals at genus one. Our proposal is motivated by formal similarities between the motivic coaction and the single-valued map of multiple polylogarithms at genus zero that are exposed in their recent reformulations via zeta generators. The genus-one coaction of this work is then proposed by analogies with the construction of single-valued iterated Eisenstein integrals via zeta generators at genus one. We show that our proposal exhibits the expected properties of a coaction and deduce $f$-alphabet decompositions of the multiple modular values obtained from regularized limits.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Grounded partitions, introduced by Dousse and Konan and motivated by the theory of perfect crystals, are combinatorial objects whose generating functions-associated to specific defining matrices-admit infinite product expressions. In this paper, we investigate the combinatorics of grounded partitions at level $2$ in type $A_1^{(1)}$ with exact difference conditions. We provide the first bijective proof that their generating functions are given by infinite products. Furthermore, we show that these partitions carry an affine crystal structure in type $A_1^{(1)}$. By restricting to the finite type $A$ crystal structure, we obtain new infinite sum expressions for the corresponding products. Remarkably, the major index statistic on Yamanouchi words arises naturally within this framework.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the twisting of motivic $L$-functions by a family of multiplicative characters $\psi$, defined on prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}$ via $\psi(p)=\alpha^{N(\mathfrak{p})}$ for a fixed $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$. One can extend $\psi$ to a continuous non-Hecke character on the idele group of a number field. For $|\alpha|<1$, the resulting $\psi$-twisted $L$-function has interesting analytic properties: an enhanced half-plane of absolute convergence, preservation of the Euler product structure, and meromorphic continuation to the complex plane. We give applications to Dirichlet $L$-functions and $L$-functions associated to modular forms. Furthermore, we show that $\psi$-twisting allows the construction of convergent $p$-adic Dirichlet series and $p$-adic Euler products.</p></details>

Elkies conjectures that the rational points on $X_0(N)^*$ are only cusps or CM points when $N$ is large enough. We establish an integrality result for the $j$-invariants of non-cuspidal rational points on $X_0(N)^*$, representing a significant step toward resolving a key subcase of Elkies' conjecture. To this end, we prove the existence of rank-zero quotients of certain modular Jacobians $J_0(pq)$. Furthermore, we provide a complete classification of the rational points on $X_0(N)^*$ of genus $1 \leq g \leq 5$, when they are finite. In the process we identify exceptional rational points on $X_0(147)^*$ and $X_0(75)^*$ which were not known before.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present the first fixed-length elementary closed-form expressions for the prime-counting function, $\pi(n)$, and the $n$-th prime number, $p(n)$. These expressions are arithmetic terms, requiring only a finite and fixed number of elementary arithmetic operations from the set: addition, subtraction, multiplication, integer division, and exponentiation. Mazzanti proved that every Kalmar function can be represented as an arithmetic term. We develop an arithmetic term representing the prime omega function, $\omega(n)$, which counts the number of distinct prime divisors of a positive integer $n$. From this term, we find immediately an arithmetic term for the prime-counting function, $\pi(n)$. Combining these results with a new arithmetic term for binomial coefficients and novel prime-related exponential Diophantine equations, we manage to develop an arithmetic term for the $n$-th prime number, $p(n)$, thereby providing a constructive solution to the fundamental question: Is there an order to the primes?</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a toy model of a 3-dimensional topological quantum gravity. In this model, a contribution of a given 3-manifold is given by the partition function of an abelian Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT), with a topological boundary condition at the boundary. Using the fact that the TQFT partition function depends only on the first homology group of the 3-manifold with some additional structure, the sum over all 3-manifolds with fixed boundary can be rewritten as a sum over finitely generated abelian groups (and the extra structure). We present bounds on the universal weights in the sum, that is, the measure on the set of isomorphism classes of finitely generated abelian groups (with the extra structure) sufficient for the sum to be convergent. Moreover, with further assumptions on the measure, we argue the existence of a distribution of 2d TQFTs, such that the sum is equal to the ensemble average of their partition functions evaluated on the boundary. For a certain kind of measure, the sum over the abelian groups can be factorized into sums over abelian $p$-groups, and the analysis can be performed independently for each prime $p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of "color rules" for computing class functions of $Z_k \wr S_n$, where $Z_k$ is the cyclic group of order $k$ and $S_n$ is the symmetric group on $n$ letters. Using a general sign-reversing involution and a map of order $k$, we give a combinatorial proof that the irreducible decomposition of these class functions is given by a weighted sum over semistandard tableaux in the colors. Since using two colors at once is also a color rule, we are consequently able to decompose arbitrary tensor products of representations whose characters can be computed via color rules. This method extends to class functions of $G \wr S_n$ where $G$ is a finite abelian group. We give a number of applications, including decomposing tensor powers of the defining representation, along with a combinatorial proof of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for $Z_k \wr S_n$. Our main application is to the study of the linear action of $Z_k \wr S_n$ on bigraded affine semigroup algebras arising from the product of projective toric varieties. In the case of the product of projective spaces, our methods give the decomposition of these bigraded characters into irreducible characters, thus deriving equivariant generalizations of Euler-Mahonian identities.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Several recent problems in the representation theory of finite groups require determining whether certain characters of almost simple groups belong to the principal block. Since the values of these characters are not yet known, we employ alternative group-theoretical techniques to address the "going down" case. This approach enables us to reduce the block version of well-known results by the third and fourth authors to a question about almost simple groups. Moreover, this suggests a Galois analogue of the height-zero-equal-degree conjecture of Malle and Navarro, which we formulate. However, the "going up" case of irreducible extensions of principal block characters remains unresolved.</p></details>

The latter ideal should be compatible at $p$ with the former and stable under the action of a semilinear Frobenius (and Verschiebung) operator; it will be the Dieudonn\'e module of the corresponding abelian variety. Using this categorical description we create effective algorithms to compute isomorphism classes of these objects and we produce many new examples exhibiting exotic patterns.</p></details>

This is an improvement on a recent result of Tsuda. We also demonstrate that a straightforward application of the Maynard-Tao method is insufficient to improve this bound. However, it allows us to establish the existence of bounded gaps between Goldbach primes with bounded error for almost all even integers $N$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 62 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the map on Balmer spectra induced by a fully faithful geometric functor is a quotient map whose fibers are connected. This is an analogue of the Zariski Connectedness Theorem in algebraic geometry and it can be applied to a plethora of examples in equivariant and motivic mathematics. We isolate a significant source of examples by introducing the "concentration" of a tt-category at a well-behaved chosen set of compact generators. Various categories of cellular objects arise in this way. In particular, the "unitation" of a tt-category is the concentration at the unit object. We compute the Balmer spectrum of the unitation of the equivariant stable homotopy category as well as related categories arising in equivariant higher algebra. We also apply our results to the study of the comparison map of a tt-category. Among other results, we prove that the comparison map of a connective category is a quotient map with connected fibers. This involves studying the tt-geometry of weight complex functors, which may be of independent interest. We also study the relationship between the comparison map and the affinization of the Balmer spectrum viewed as a locally ringed space. These results provide a layered approach to understanding the spectrum of a given tt-category, by starting with the Zariski spectrum of the endomorphism ring of the unit, and then passing backwards to larger and larger concentrations (through quotient maps with connected fibers). Significant stages along the way include the passage to the unitation and the passage to the concentration at the Picard group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper aims to use a cluster-theoretic approach to give a kind of Diophantine equation whose solutions can be obtained by starting from initial solutions through mutations. We establish a novel framework bridging cluster theory and Diophantine equations through the lens of cluster symmetry. On the one hand, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for Laurent polynomials to remain invariant under a given cluster symmetric map. On the other hand, we construct a discriminant algorithm to determine whether the corresponding Laurent polynomial admits a cluster symmetric pair and whether it can be realized in a generalized cluster algebra. As applications of this framework, we solve two Diophantine equations, describe three classes of invariant Laurent polynomial rings, resolve two questions posed by Gyoda and Matsushita in \cite{Gyoda}, and lastly give two Matlab programs, respectively, for constructing invariant Laurent polynomials and finding cluster symmetric pairs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In two papers entitled ``Two generalizations of almost perfect nonlinearity" and ``On the vector subspaces of $\mathbb F_{2^n}$ over which the multiplicative inverse function sums to zero", the first author has introduced and studied the notion of sum-freedom of vectorial functions, which expresses that a function sums to nonzero values over all affine subspaces of $\Bbb F_{2^n}$ of a given dimension $k\geq 2$, and he then focused on the $k$th order sum-freedom of the multiplicative inverse function $x\in \Bbb F_{2^n}\mapsto x^{2^n-2}$. Some general results were given for this function (in particular, the case of affine spaces that do not contain 0 was solved positively), and the cases of $k\in \{3,n-3\}$ and of $k$ not co-prime with $n$ were solved as well (negatively); but the cases of those linear subspaces of dimension $k\in [\![ 4;n-4]\!]$, co-prime with $n$, were left open. The present paper is a continuation of the previous work. After studying, from two different angles, the particular case of those linear subspaces that are stable under the Frobenius automorphism, we deduce from the second approach that, for $k$ small enough (approximately, $3\le k\leq n/10$), the multiplicative inverse function is not $k$th order sum-free. Finally, we extend a result previously obtained in the second paper mentioned above, and we deduce in particular that, for any even $n$ and every $2\leq k\leq n-2$, the multiplicative inverse function is not $k$th order sum-free.</p></details>

This question, which is at the heart of anabelian geometry, a theory built on the collaborative efforts of an international community in many variants and with the Japanese arithmetic school as a core, illustrates, in the case of a positive answer, the universality of the homotopic method in arithmetic geometry. Starting with elementary examples, we first introduce the motivations and guiding principles of the theory, then present its most structuring results and its contemporary trends. As a result, the reader is presented with a rich and diverse landscape of mathematics, which thrives on theoretical and explicit methods, and runs from number theory to topology.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 64 pages. In this revision, we explain why the fusion product of V along the torus equals Lyubashenko's coend, as previously claimed in Section 0.6 of the earlier versions

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite VOA, not necessarily rational or self-dual. In this paper, we establish various versions of the sewing-factorization (SF) theorems for conformal blocks associated to grading-restricted generalized modules of $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$ (where $N\in\mathbb N$). In addition to the versions announced in the Introduction of [GZ23], we prove the following coend version of the SF theorem: Let $\mathfrak F$ be a compact Riemann surface with $N$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points, and let $\mathfrak G$ be another compact Riemann surface with $K$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points. Assign $\mathbb W\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes N})$ and $\mathbb X\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes K})$ to the incoming marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. For each $\mathbb{M} \in \mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes R})$, assign $\mathbb{M}$ and its contragredient $\mathbb M'$ to the outgoing marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. Denote the corresponding spaces of conformal blocks by $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb W)$ and $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak{G}}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes\mathbb X)$. Let the $\mathfrak X$ be the $(N+K)$-pointed surface obtained by sewing $\mathfrak F$, $\mathfrak G$ along their outgoing marked points. Then the sewing of conformal blocks-proved to be convergent in [GZ24]-yields an isomorphism of vector spaces $$\int^{\mathbb{M}\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes R})}\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb{W})\otimes_{\mathbb C} \mathscr T_{\mathfrak G}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes \mathbb X)\simeq\mathscr T_{\mathfrak X}^*(\mathbb W\otimes \mathbb X)$$ We also discuss the relation between conformal blocks and the modular functors defined using Lyubashenko's coend in the case where $\mathbb V$ is strongly finite and rigid.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article develops a practical technique for studying representations of $\Bbbk$-linear categories arising in the categorification of quantum groups. We work in terms of locally unital algebras which are $\mathbb{Z}$-graded with graded pieces that are finite-dimensional and bounded below, developing a theory of graded triangular bases for such algebras. The definition is a graded extension of the notion of triangular basis introduced in previous joint work with Stroppel. However, in the general graded setting, finitely generated projective modules often fail to be Noetherian, so that existing results from the study of highest weight categories are not directly applicable. Nevertheless, we show that there is still a good theory of standard modules. In motivating examples arising from Kac-Moody 2-categories, these modules categorify the PBW bases for the modified forms of quantum groups constructed by Wang.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider in-depth and characterize in certain aspects the class of so-called {\it strongly NUS-nil clean rings}, that are those rings whose non-units are {\it square nil-clean} in the sense that they are a sum of a nilpotent and a square-idempotent that commutes with each other. This class of rings lies properly between the classes of strongly nil-clean rings and strongly clean rings. In fact, it is proved the valuable criterion that a ring $R$ is strongly NUS-nil clean if, and only if, $a^4-a^2\in Nil(R)$ for every $a\not\in U(R)$. In particular, a ring $R$ with only trivial idempotents is strongly NUS-nil clean if, and only if, $R$ is a local ring with nil Jacobson radical. Some special matrix constructions and group ring extensions will provide us with new sources of examples of NUS-nil clean rings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Foulkes' conjecture has several generalisations due to Doran, Abdesselam--Chipalkatti, Bergeron, and Troyka. For the special linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$, these assert that given $a \le c \le d \le b$ with $ab=cd$, the $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-representation $\mathrm{Sym}^a\mathrm{Sym}^b\mathbb{C}^2$ is a subrepresentation of $\mathrm{Sym}^c\mathrm{Sym}^d\mathbb{C}^2$. We present a short proof in the case where $a$ divides $c$ or $d$, which includes all prime values of $a$. This is the first proof in this family of conjectures valid for infinitely many values of $a$; previously only the cases $a=2$ and $a=3$ were known.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a family of quantum algorithms for estimating Gowers uniformity norms $ U^k $ over finite abelian groups and demonstrate their applications to testing polynomial structure and counting arithmetic progressions. Building on recent work for estimating the $ U^2 $-norm over $ \mathbb{F}_2^n $, we generalize the construction to arbitrary finite fields and abelian groups for higher values of $ k $. Our algorithms prepare quantum states encoding finite differences and apply Fourier sampling to estimate uniformity norms, enabling efficient detection of structural correlations. As a key application, we show that for certain degrees $ d = 4, 5, 6 $ and under appropriate conditions on the underlying field, there exist quasipolynomial-time quantum algorithms that distinguish whether a bounded function $ f(x) $ is a degree-$ d $ phase polynomial or far from any such structure. These algorithms leverage recent inverse theorems for Gowers norms, together with amplitude estimation, to reveal higher-order algebraic correlations. We also develop a quantum method for estimating the number of 3-term arithmetic progressions in Boolean functions $ f : \mathbb{F}_p^n \to \{0,1\} $, based on estimating the $ U^2 $-norm. Though not as query-efficient as Grover-based counting, our approach provides a structure-sensitive alternative aligned with additive combinatorics. Finally, we demonstrate that our techniques remain valid under certain quantum noise models, due to the shift-invariance of Gowers norms. This enables noise-resilient implementations within the NISQ regime and suggests that Gowers-norm-based quantum algorithms may serve as robust primitives for quantum property testing, learning, and pseudorandomness.</p></details>

Recent work indicates that such connection extends to one of its upper bounds, the delooping level. In this paper, we show that the same holds for the derived delooping level, which is an improvement of the delooping level. This reduces the finitistic dimension conjecture to considering algebras whose opposite algebra has (derived) delooping level zero. We thereby demonstrate ways to utilize the new concept of derived delooping level to obtain new results and present additional work involving tensor product of algebras.</p></details>

In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of these sequences in affine Weyl groups. Let $W$ be an affine Weyl group with corresponding Weyl group $W_f$ and ${}^{f}{W}$ be the set of minimal representatives for the right cosets $W_f \backslash W$. Let $t_{\lambda}$ be the translation by a dominant coroot lattice element $\lambda$ and ${}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{\lambda}}$ be the number of elements of length $i$ below $t_\lambda$ in the Bruhat order on ${}^{f}{W}$. We show that the sequence $({}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{\lambda}})_i$ is ''asymptotically log-concave'' in the following sense: The sequence of discrete measures $(\mathfrak{m}_k)_k$ constructed from the $k$-fold dilated sequence $({}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{k\lambda}})_i$, as $k$ tends to infinity, converges weakly to a continuous measure obtained from a polytope $P^\lambda$. Moreover, the sequence of step functions $(S_k)_k$ of $({}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{k\lambda}})_i$ converges uniformly to the density function of this continuous measure. By Brunn--Minkowski inequality, this density is log-concave.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A matching from a finite subset $A$ of an abelian group $G$ to another subset $B$ is a bijection $f : A \to B$ such that $af(a) \notin A$ for all $a \in A$. The study of matchings began in the 1990s and was motivated by a conjecture of E. K. Wakeford on canonical forms for homogeneous polynomials. The theory was later extended to the linear setting of vector subspaces over field extensions, and then to matroids. In this paper, we investigate the existence and structure of matchings in both abelian groups and field extensions. Using Dyson's $e$-transform, a tool from additive combinatorics, along with a linear analogue which is introduced in this paper, we establish characterization theorems for matchable sets and subspaces. Several applications are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of these theorems as standalone tools. Throughout, we highlight the parallels between the group-theoretic and linear perspectives.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Supersingular elliptic curve isogeny graphs underlie isogeny-based cryptography. For isogenies of a single prime degree $\ell$, their structure has been investigated graph-theoretically. We generalise the notion of $\ell$-isogeny graphs to $L$-isogeny graphs (studied in the prime field case by Delfs and Galbraith), where $L$ is a set of small primes dictating the allowed isogeny degrees in the graph. We analyse the graph-theoretic structure of $L$-isogeny graphs. Our approaches may be put into two categories: cycles and graph cuts. On the topic of cycles, we provide: a count for the number of cycles in the $L$-isogeny graph with cyclic kernels using traces of Brandt matrices; an efficiently computable estimate based on this approach; and a third ideal-theoretic count for a certain subclass of $L$-isogeny cycles. We provide code to compute each of these three counts. On the topic of graph cuts, we compare several algorithms to compute graph cuts which minimise a measure called the edge expansion, outlining a cryptographic motivation for doing so. Our results show that a greedy neighbour algorithm out-performs standard spectral algorithms for computing optimal graph cuts. We provide code and study explicit examples.

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01040v1'>2508.01040</a>\]&nbsp; **Bricks and $τ$-tilting theory under base field extensions**

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K:k$ be a field extension and let $\Lambda$ be a finite-dimensional $k$-algebra. We investigate the relationship between $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda_K = \Lambda \otimes_k K$ with particular emphasis on various aspects of $\tau$-tilting theory and bricks. We show that many types of objects for $\Lambda$ lift injectively to the same type of object for $\Lambda_K$, and many common constructions in $\tau$-tilting theory commute with the process of extending the base field. One of our main applications is the construction of a faithful functor from the $\tau$-cluster morphism category $\mathfrak{W}(\Lambda)$ of $\Lambda$ to the $\tau$-cluster morphism category $\mathfrak{W}(\Lambda_K)$ of $\Lambda_K$. In particular, this establishes a faithful functor from $\mathfrak{W}(\Lambda)$ to a group whenever $k$ is of characteristic zero which has many important consequences. In the appendix, E. J. Hanson shows the analogous result whenever $k$ is a finite field. Moreover, we give some nontrivial examples to illustrate the behaviour of $\tau$-tilting finiteness under base field extension.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01037v1'>2508.01037</a>\]&nbsp; **The Order of the Monster Finite Simple Group**

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine the order of the largest of the twenty-six sporadic simple groups known as the Monster, using a straightforward computational approach. The Monster is here defined as a subgroup of the symmetry group of the 196884-dimensional Griess algebra generated by a group of type $2^{1+24}_+.Co_1$ and an additional triality automorphism. Our approach is based on counting arguments for certain idempotents of the Griess algebra called axes. Our proof is self-contained, requiring only established properties of the Conway group as the automorphism group of the Leech lattice, and some of its subgroups. Although our approach is conceptually simple, it requires extensive calculation inside a 196884-dimensional matrix group that current computer algebra systems cannot easily handle directly. Instead, we use the software package mmgroup, developed by the second author, which supports fast calculations inside the Monster. To our knowledge, this paper contains the first self-contained computation of the order of the Monster. The Monster also acts on the Moonshine module V^#, which is a vertex operator algebra of central charge c=24. We provide a new proof that the Monster is the full automorphism group of the Griess algebra and of the Moonshine module using Borcherds' proof of the Monstrous Moonshine conjectures. In addition, we show that the Monster has exactly two conjugacy classes of involutions. The order of the Baby Monster, the second largest of the sporadic simple groups, is also determined.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: 48 pages. Streamlined parts of the text; introduced the notion of a tensor functor being Frobenius with respect to a module category (Sec. 4), including examples from Hopf algebras (Sec. 5); corrected an error in Lemma 4.10 from the previous version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We call a tensor functor $F:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{D}$ between finite tensor categories $\otimes$-Frobenius if the left and right adjoints of $F$ are isomorphic as $\mathcal{C}$-bimodule functors. We provide various characterizations of $\otimes$-Frobenius functors such as the unimodularity of the centralizer $\mathcal{Z}({}_F\mathcal{D}_F)$. We analyze the procedure of pulling back actions of tensor categories on module categories along tensor functors, and show that properties like pivotality and unimodularity are preserved if $F$ if $\otimes$-Frobenius. These results allow the transport of Frobenius algebras under certain conditions. We apply the results to internal natural transformations and examples coming from Hopf algebras.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a new conjecture (Conjecture 1.1) on the structure of the unitary dual by means of the Arthur representations for general reductive algebraic groups defined over any non-Archimedean local field of characteristic zero. We also propose a conjecture (Conjecture 1.2) refining Conjecture 1.1 for representations of good parity. The relations among the two conjectures and special families of representations are explained in Figure 1. The main results include a partial approval of Conjecture 1.1 (Theorem 1.5); an algorithm to determine a candidate of the unitary dual (Algorithm 8.5); and the verification of Conjectures 1.1 and 1.2 for many known unitary duals, especially for representations of corank at most 3 for symplectic or split odd special orthogonal groups, based on Tadi{\'c}'s classification (Theorem 1.6), and G_2. To prove the main results, we develop new algorithms to determine whether a given irreducible representation is of Arthur type and give an inductive approach to classify the family of unitary representations that are of Arthur type for classical groups. We explicate this approach towards the unitary dual problem for representations of corank 3 and several new families of representations.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10777v2'>2505.10777</a>\]&nbsp; **On Some Open Cases of a Conjecture of Conrad, Edixhoven and Stein**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-01 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Davide De Leo, Michael Stoll &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Removed Conjecture 1.1; added Remark 1.1. Corrected some typos and improved clarity

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let \( p \geq 5 \) be a prime. In 2003 Conrad, Edixhoven, and Stein conjectured that the rational torsion subgroup of the modular Jacobian \( J_1(p) \) coincides with the rational cuspidal divisor class group. Using explicit computations in Magma, the open case \( p = 29 \) has been proven by Derickx, Kamienny, Stein, and Stoll in 2023. We extend these results to primes \( p = 97, 101, 109, \) and \( 113 \). In addition, we provide a list of the groups \( J_1(p)(\mathbb{Q})_{\text{tors}} \) for every prime up to \( p \leq 113 \). However, our method is general and can be applied to larger primes.</p></details>
