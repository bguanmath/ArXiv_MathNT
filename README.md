 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Lucien Hennecart, Tasuki Kinjo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a strong form of the cohomological integrality theorem, decomposing the cohomology of smooth symmetric stacks as the cohomological Hall induction of the intersection cohomology of the good moduli spaces of stacks of graded points. This generalizes the previous result by the second author together with Bu--Davison--Ib\'a\~nez Nu\~nez--P\u{a}durariu to non-orthogonal stacks, and confirms a conjecture of the first author that the algebraic BPS cohomology of the quotient stack of a symmetric representation matches the intersection cohomology group whenever it is nonzero. As a consequence, we obtain a version of the cohomological integrality theorem for general 0-shifted symplectic stacks with good moduli spaces, as well as for the character stacks of general compact oriented $3$-manifolds with reductive gauge groups. As an application, we prove Halpern-Leistner's conjecture on the purity of the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks admitting proper good moduli spaces. Our proof combines a cohomological bound for the algebraic BPS cohomology, due to the first author and based on Efimov's lemma, with a vanishing-cycle argument due to the second author in collaboration with Bu--Davison--Ib\'a\~nez Nu\~nez--P\u{a}durariu.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By systematically translating certain integrals involving moments of the elliptic integral into $L$-values of modular forms on $\Gamma_1(4), \Gamma(4)$ and $\Gamma_1(8)$, and then utilizing relations among the critical $L$-values of cuspidal newforms, we obtain a dimension formula for the space spanned by these integrals.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Revised version. 30 pages, 6 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>To find crystals of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ representations of the form $\Lambda^n\text{Sym}^r\mathbb{C}^2$ it suffices to solve the combinatorial problem of decomposing Young's lattice into symmetric, saturated chains. We review the literature on this latter problem, and present a strategy to solve it. For $n \le 4$, the strategy recovers recently discovered solutions. We obtain (i) counting formulas for plethystic coefficients, (ii) new recursive formulas for plethysms of Schur functions, and (iii) formulas for the number of constituents of $\Lambda^n\text{Sym}^r\mathbb{C}^2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Every Anderson $A$-motive $M$ over a field determines a compatible system of Galois representations on its Tate modules at almost all primes of $A$. This adapts easily to $F$-isocrystals, which are rational analogues of $A$-motives for the global function field $F:=\mathrm{Quot}(A)$. We extend this compatible system by constructing a Weil group representation associated to $M$ for every place of $F$. To this end we generalize the Tate module construction to a tensor functor on $F_{\mathfrak{p}}$-isocrystals that are not necessarily pure. To prove that this yields a compatible system, we work out how that construction behaves under reduction of $M$. As an offshoot we obtain a new kind of $\wp$-adic Weil representations associated to Drinfeld modules of special characteristic $\wp$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21232v1'>2509.21232</a>\]&nbsp; **Double Poisson (vertex) algebra cohomology**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Maxime Fairon, Daniele Valeri &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A noncommutative (NC) version of Poisson geometry was initiated by Van den Bergh by introducing at the level of associative algebras the formalism of double Poisson brackets. Their key property is to induce (standard) Poisson brackets under each representation functor. Then, Pichereau and Van de Weyer developed and studied the corresponding cohomology theory under the assumption that there exists a NC bivector defining the double Poisson bracket. Our first main result is that one can remove this assumption by constructing a completed double Poisson cohomology valid in any situation, hence generalizing the approach of Pichereau-Van de Weyer. As an application, we show that the double Poisson cohomology complex associated to the path algebra of a quiver is acyclic. Furthermore, we show that this new double Poisson cohomology theory can be adapted to weaker forms of double Poisson brackets (called quasi-Poisson and gauged Poisson), and that it is compatible with representation functors. A second focus of this memoir concerns the formalism of double Poisson vertex algebras. These were introduced by De Sole, Kac and the second author, as NC versions of Poisson vertex algebras, which induce the latter structures under each representation functor. Our second main result is the development of cohomology theories for double Poisson vertex algebras. These are NC analogues of the basic, reduced and variational Poisson vertex algebra cohomologies. More importantly, we prove that under each representation functor these cohomology theories are compatible with their commutative counterparts. As an application, we compute the double Poisson vertex algebra cohomology of the generalized NC de Rham complex and of the generalized NC variational complex. Finally, we describe the relation between the double Poisson algebra and double Poisson vertex algebra cohomologies using jet and quotient functors.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use Bailey pairs to prove $q$-series identities at roots of unity due to Cohen and Bryson-Ono-Pitman-Rhoades. The proofs use Bailey pairs with quadratic forms developed in the study of mock theta functions. In addition to the standard Bailey lemma, we require some changes-of-base established by Bressoud-Ismail-Stanton. We then embed the identities in infinite families using the Bailey chain.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: 91 pages, minor updates. Comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use the methods introduced by Lue Pan to study the locally analytic vectors in the completed cohomology of unitary Shimura curves. As an application, we prove a classicality result on two-dimensional regular $\sigma$-de Rham representations of $\text{Gal}(\bar L/L)$ appearing in the locally $\sigma$-analytic vectors of the completed cohomology, where $L$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $\sigma:L\hookrightarrow E$ is an embedding of $L$ into a sufficiently large finite extension $E$ of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. We also prove that if a two-dimensional representation of $\text{Gal}(\bar L/L)$ appears in the locally $\sigma$-algebraic vectors of the completed cohomology then it is $\sigma$-de Rham. Finally, we give a geometric realization of some locally $\sigma$-analytic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(L)$. This realization has some applications to the $p$-adic local Langlands program, including a locality theorem for Galois representations arising from classical automorphic forms, an admissibility result for coherent cohomology of Drinfeld curves, and some special cases of the Breuil's locally analytic Ext$^1$-conjecture for $\mathrm{GL}_2(L)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 72 pages, 12 figures; added Appendix B, to appear in Trans. Amer. Math. Soc

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the paper, we show some properties of (reduced) stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras related to their centers for essentially bordered pb surfaces, especially their centers, finitely generation over their centers, and their PI-degrees. The proofs are based on the quantum trace maps, embeddings of (reduced) stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras into quantum tori appearing in higher Teichm\"uller theory. Thanks to the Unicity theorem in [BG02, FKBL19], we can understand the representation theory of (reduced) stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras. Moreover, the applications are beyond low-dimensional topology. For example, we can access to the representation theory of unrestricted quantum moduli algebras, and that of quantum higher cluster algebras potentially.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kurt Girstmair &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is a survey of a connection between the distribution of certain power residues modulo $p$, $p$ a prime, and relative class numbers. The focus lies on quadratic residues and sixth power residues. Dirichlet's class number formula yields a number of results about the distribution of quadratic residues, for instance, the well-known fact that the interval $[0,p/2]$ contains more quadratic residues than nonresidues. This class number formula is also responsible for some properties of the digit expansions of numbers $m/p$, $p\NDIV m$. In a certain sense the results based on Dirichlet's formula can be extended to sixth power residues, where geometry plays an important role.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Satyabrat Sahoo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 15 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix a rational prime $r \geq 5$. In this article, we study the integer solutions of the generalized Fermat equation of signature $(2p,2q,r)$, namely $x^{2p}+y^{2q}=z^r$, where the primes $p,q \geq 5$ are varying. For each rational prime $r \geq 5$, we first establish a condition on the solutions of the $S$-unit equation over $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_r+ \zeta_r^{-1})$ such that there exists a constant $V_{r}>0$ (depending on $r$) for which the equation $x^{2p}+y^{2q}=z^r$ with $p,q \geq V_r$ has no non-trivial primitive integer solutions. Then for each rational prime $r \geq 2$, we prove that every elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_r+ \zeta_r^{-1})$ is modular. As an application of this, we prove that the above constant $V_r$ is effectively computable. Finally, we provide a criterion for $r$ such that the equation $x^{2p}+y^{2q}=z^r$ with $p,q \geq V_r$ has no non-trivial primitive integer solutions when the narrow class number of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_r+ \zeta_r^{-1})$ is odd.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the analogues of certain classical estimates of Littlewood for the Riemann zeta-function in the context of quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions over function fields. In some situations, we are actually able to establish finer results in the function field setup than what is currently known in the original number field setup, and this leads us to an educated guess on what could happen for the Riemann zeta-function in such situations. Fourier analysis techniques play an important role in our approach.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 33 pages. Some minor changes have been made to the exposition. Accepted for publication in Studia Mathematica

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a locally elliptic group, $(\Phi,\Psi)$ a complementary pair of Young functions, and $\omega: G \rightarrow [1,\infty)$ a weight function on $G$ such that the weighted Orlicz space $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is a Banach $*$-algebra when equipped with the convolution product and involution $f^*(x):=\overline{f(x^{-1})}$ ($f \in L^\Phi(G,\omega)$). Such a weight always exists on $G$ and we call it an $L^\Phi$-weight. We assume that $1/\omega \in L^\Psi(G)$ so that $L^\Phi(G,\omega) \subseteq L^1(G)$. This paper studies the spectral theory and primitive ideal structure of $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$. In particular, we focus on studying the Hermitian, Wiener and $*$-regularity properties on this algebra, along with some related questions on spectral synthesis. It is shown that $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is always quasi-Hermitian, weakly-Wiener and $*$-regular. Thus, if $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is Hermitian, then it is also Wiener. Although, in general, $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is not always Hermitian, it is known that Hermitianness of $L^1(G)$ implies Hermitianness of $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ if $\omega$ is sub-additive. We give numerous examples of locally elliptic groups $G$ for which $L^1(G)$ is Hermitian and sub-additive $L^\Phi$-weights on these groups. In the weighted $L^1$ case, even stronger Hermitianness results are formulated.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages, many sections cut out

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Reduced cohomology motivates to look at harmonic functions which satisfy certain gradient conditions. If $G$ is a direct product of two infinite groups or a (FC-central)-by-cyclic group, then there are no harmonic functions with gradient in $c_0$ on its Cayley graphs. From this, it follows that a metabelian group $G$ has no harmonic functions with gradient in $\ell^p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the notions of parabolic representation pair variety and relative representation variety of a given parabolic type. We investigate the local behavior of these varieties. The Zariski tangent space and the tangent quadratic cones are described. By the Riemann--Hilbert--Deligne correspondence, we pro-represent the analytic germs of these varieties by functors related to certain groupoids of parabolic logarithmic flat bundles. Under suitable assumptions, we prove that the differential graded Lie algebra (DGLA) controlling the deformation of parabolic logarithmic flat bundle is mixedly formal. Finally, we construct the moduli space of weighted parabolic representation pairs, and, by means of quiver representation theory, we establish the Kobayashi--Hitchin-type theorem for polystable parabolic representation pairs.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 90 pages. The formulations of Theorem 2.1 by Miyamoto and Arike and Theorem 2.2 by Fiordalisi are corrected and their corresponding use in the main body of the paper is adjusted

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $V$ be a $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra without nonzero elements of negative weights. We prove the conjecture that the spaces spanned by analytic extensions of pseudo-$q$-traces ($q=e^{2\pi i\tau}$) shifted by $-\frac{c}{24}$ of products of geometrically-modified (logarithmic) intertwining operators among grading-restricted generalized $V$-modules are invariant under modular transformations. The convergence and analytic extension result needed to formulate this conjecture and some consequences on such shifted pseudo-$q$-traces were proved by Fiordalisi in [F1] and [F2] using the method developed in [H2]. The method that we use to prove this conjecture is based on the theory of the associative algebras $A^{N}(V)$ for $N\in \mathbb{N}$, their graded modules and their bimodules introduced and studied by the author in [H8] and [H9]. This modular invariance result gives a construction of $C_2$-cofinite genus-one logarithmic conformal field theories from the corresponding genus-zero logarithmic conformal field theories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using a complex parameterizing rational spherical chains, we construct explicit cocycles for $\mathrm{GL}_n(\Q)$ valued in the motivic cohomology of (open subsets of) the algebraic $n$-torus $\mathbb{G}_m^n$. The resulting cocycles directly generalize the work of Sharifi and Venkatesh from the case $n=2$ \cite{SV}. Even in this special case, our systematic use of pushforwards allows us to avoid the use of their ``connecting sequences,'' and allows us to refine the construction and Hecke properties of the Sharifi map $\varpi$ to the maximal expected statements, while inverting only the prime $2$. For general $n$, the $d\log$ regulator of our cocycle is related by convex conical duality to cocycles constructed from Shintani cones. This affords a systematic approach to $p$-adic $L$-functions for totally real fields without need for auxiliary data or logarithm sheaf coefficients, including a distribution-valued $\GL_n(\Z)$-cocycle specializing in a simple way to all such $p$-adic $L$-functions. It moreover provides a direct conceptual link between polylogarithmic constructions of Eisenstein classes (e.g., in \cite{BKL}), and those constructed using Shintani cones (e.g., in \cite{CDG}). We also show how our formalism gives an alternate proof of the exceptional divisibilities of the Deligne-Ribet $2$-adic $L$-function in almost all cases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we broaden Shiu's Brun-Titchmarsh theorem to allow for functions that are larger and/or smooth-supported. In particular, let $f$ be a nonnegative multiplicative function. We prove that if there exists a $\beta<1$ such that $f(p^l)\ll (\log\log x)^{l\beta}$ for every prime $p$ and every $l>1$, and if $f(n)\ll \max\{n^\epsilon,(\log x)^\epsilon\}$ for every $\epsilon>0$, then $$\sum_{\substack{x\leq n\leq x+y \\ n\equiv a\pmod k}}f(n)\ll \frac{y}{\phi(k)(\log x)^{1-\epsilon_0}}\exp\left(\sum_{\substack{p\leq x \\ p\nmid k}}\frac{f(p)}{p}\right)$$ for every $\epsilon_0>0$, where $x$, $y$, and $k$ are as they were in Shiu's original paper and $(a,k)=1$. Moreover, we prove that if $f$ is a $Q$-smooth-supported function then there exists a constant $C$ for which $$\sum_{\substack{x\leq n\leq x+y \\ n\equiv a\pmod k}}f(n)\ll \frac{y}{\phi(k)(\log x)^{1-\epsilon_0}}\exp\left(\sum_{\substack{p\leq x \\ p\nmid k}}\frac{f(p)}{p}\right)\rho(u)^C,$$ where $u=\frac{\log x}{\log Q}$, $\rho$ is the Dickman-de Bruijn function, and $C$ depends on whether we choose the bound of $f(p^l)\leq A_1^l$ or $f(p^l)\ll (\log\log x)^{l\beta}$. We also give applications to both the divisor function to large powers and to smooth numbers in short intervals.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a counterexample to a conjecture of Hildebrand which states that if $\S$ has positive lower density and is stable i.e. for all $d$, $n$ is in $\mathcal{S}$ if and only if $dn$ is in $\mathcal{S}$ except on a set of density $0$ then $\mathcal{S} \cap (\mathcal{S}+1) \cap (\mathcal{S}+2)$ has positive lower density and in particular is nonempty. We further show there exists a stable set of density $1 -\frac{1}{q-1}$ such that $\mathcal{S} \cap \cdots \cap (\mathcal{S} + q -1) = \emptyset$ when $q$ is a prime, matching a bound proven by Hildebrand. Finally, we construct a function $f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \{\pm 1\}$ such that $f(pn) = -f(n)$ for all but a $0$ density set of $n$ depending on the prime $p$ but which fails the analogues of Sarnak and Chowla's conjectures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The arithmetic properties of the second order mock theta function $\mathcal{B}(q)$, introduced by McIntosh, defined by \begin{equation*} \mathcal{B}(q) := \sum_{n \geq 0} \frac{q^n (-q;q^2)_n}{(q;q^2)_{n+1}} = \sum_{n \geq 0}b(n)q^n, \end{equation*} have been extensively studied. For instance, for all $n\ge0$, Kaur and Rana established congruences such as for all $n\ge0$, \begin{align*} b(12n+10) &\equiv 0 \pmod{36}, \quad b(18n+16) \equiv 0 \pmod{72}, \end{align*} Chen and Mao proved that for all $n\ge0$, \begin{align*} b(4n+1) &\equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \quad b(4n+2) \equiv 0 \pmod{4}, \end{align*} while Mao also showed that for all $n\ge0$, \begin{align*} b(6n+2) &\equiv 0 \pmod{4}, \quad b(6n+4) \equiv 0 \pmod{9}. \end{align*} In this paper, we find new congruences and infinite families of congruences modulo $2, 4, 8, 36, 54, 72$ for the function $\mathcal{B}(q)$. For example, let $p \geq 5$ be a prime, if $\left(\frac{-3}{p}\right)_L = -1$, then for all $n, k \geq 0$ with $p \nmid n$, we have \begin{equation*} b\left( 3p^{2k+1}n + \frac{p^{2k+2}-1}{2} \right) \equiv 0 \pmod{2}. \end{equation*} Let $p \geq 5$ be a prime and $1 \leq \ell \leq p - 1$ such that $\left( \frac{12\ell + 9}{p} \right)_L = -1$. Then for all $n, k \geq 0$, we have \begin{equation*} b\left(6p^{2k+3}n + \frac{3p^{2k+2}(4\ell+3)-1}{2}\right) \equiv 0 \pmod{36}. \end{equation*} Our techniques involve elementary $q$-series and Maple.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article we study the algebraic structure of fine Mordell--Weil groups, plus/minus Mordell--Weil groups, Selmer groups, and plus/minus Selmer groups in the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of abelian number fields. As a first, we prove theorems on the equivariant structure of fine Mordell--Weil groups and plus/minus Mordell--Weil groups. In other words, we study the explicit shape of the fine, plus/minus objects as a $\Lambda(\mathcal{G})$-module with $\mathcal{G} \simeq \mathbb{Z}_p \times G$ and $G$ a finite abelian group. We prove refinements of previously known results over $\mathbb{Q}$ for the classical Selmer group and the plus/minus Selmer group, and subsequently also the Shafarevich--Tate group, and the plus/minus Shafarevich--Tate group. This gives new evidence towards an affirmative answer for the Kurihara--Pollack problem.</p></details>

In particular, we show how natural geometric constructions of infinitely many degree d points on curves motivate the definitions of $\mathbb{P}^1$- and AV-parameterized points and explain how a result of Faltings implies that there are only finitely many isolated points on any curve. We use parameterized points to deduce properties of the density degree set and show that parameterized points of very low degree arise for a unique geometric reason.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the minimax problem for restricted two-fold self-sumsets in $k$-colorings of $\mathbb{Z}_n$. For primes $p$ with $2\le k\le p$ we determine the exact minimum $\max\{0,\,2\lceil p/k\rceil-3\}$. For general $n$ (with $m=\lceil n/k\rceil$) we bound the optimum between a size term $\min\{p(n),\,2m-3\}$ and a periodicity term $f\big(n/q(n,k)\big)$, and show these bounds are tight when $2m-3\le p(n)$ or $f\big(n/q(n,k)\big)\le \min\{p(n),\,2m-3\}$. We further prove a stability inequality and a threshold theorem that force concentration in a single subgroup coset near the periodic scale. In the prime case with $m\ge 5$ and $2m-3<p$, every optimal coloring contains a class of size $m$ that is an arc (an arithmetic progression up to an affine automorphism). Our approach combines the restricted Erd\H{o}s--Heilbronn phenomenon with block/coset colorings and an injectivity window.</p></details>

[In case i), it is understood these are continuous.] The actual statement is much stronger: for all $r \geq 1$, under "suitable" assumptions, triangular representations $\rho_r: \Gamma \to \mathbf{B}_d(\mathbb{Z}/p^r)$ lift to $\rho_{r+1}: \Gamma \to \mathbf{B}_d(\mathbb{Z}/p^{r+1})$, in the strongest possible step-by-step sense.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1975, G. E.

This question is important because many different $q$-series appearing in combinatorics, representation theory, and physics often seem to be mysteriously modular, yet there is no general test to confirm this directly from the exotic $q$-series expressions. In this note, solve this general problem using $q$-series algebra and $q$-series systems of differential equations. Specifically, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for when holomorphic $q$-series on $|q|<1$ form a vector-valued modular function. This result offers a clear and conceptual path to modularity for "strange" $q$-series.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given positive integers $h, N$ satisfying $1 \leqslant h \leqslant 2N^2$, we define $T(h,N)$ to be the number of $2\times 2$ integer matrices with determinant equal to $h$ whose entries lie in $[-N,N]$. Our first result states that for any $\varepsilon >0$, one has $$ T(h,N) = \frac{16}{\zeta(2)} N^2 \bigg( \sum_{d |h} \frac{1}{d} \bigg) + O_{\varepsilon}(N^{\varepsilon} (N+ h)).$$ This quantitatively improves upon recent work of Afifurrahman and Ganguly--Guria. We further show that when $N^{1 + \delta} \leqslant h \leqslant 2N^2$ for any fixed $\delta>0$, the error term above is of roughly the right order. Our second result delivers an asymptotic formula for $T(h,N)$ with square-root cancellation whenever $h = N^2 + O(N)$. This error term is much stronger than its corresponding analogue in the smoothened version of this problem. More generally, for any $\varepsilon >0$ and any $N,h \in \mathbb{N}$ with $1\leq h \leq 2N^2$, we prove that $$ T(h,N) = \bigg( \frac{8}{\zeta(2)} - 4 \bigg)N^2 \bigg( \sum_{d |h} \frac{1}{d} \bigg) + O_{\varepsilon}(N^{\varepsilon}(N+ |h-N^2|)). $$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The periodic Temperley-Lieb category consists of connectivity diagrams drawn on a ring with $N$ and $N'$ nodes on the outer and inner boundary, respectively. We consider families of modules, namely sequences of modules $\mathsf{M}(N)$ over the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra for varying values of $N$, endowed with an action $\mathsf{M}(N') \to \mathsf{M}(N)$ of the diagrams. Examples of modules that can be organised into families are those arising in the RSOS model and in the XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain, as well as several others constructed from link states. We construct a fusion product which outputs a family of modules from any pair of families. Its definition is inspired from connectivity diagrams drawn on a disc with two holes. It is thus defined in a way to describe intermediate states in lattice correlation functions. We prove that this fusion product is a bifunctor, and that it is distributive, commutative, and associative.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We formulate a model for the average behaviour of ray class groups of real quadratic fields with respect to a fixed rational modulus, locally at a finite set $S$ of odd primes. To that end, we introduce Arakelov ray class groups of a number field, and postulate that, locally at $S$, the Arakelov ray class groups of real quadratic fields are distributed randomly with respect to a natural Cohen--Lenstra type probability measure. We show that our heuristics imply the Cohen--Lenstra heuristics on class groups of real quadratic fields, as well as equidistribution results on the fundamental unit of a real quadratic field modulo an integer, and are consistent with Varma's results on average of sizes of $3$-torsion subgroups of ray class groups of quardratic fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a nonarchimedean local field with residue field of cardinality $q$, let $G$ be the $F$-points of a connected reductive group defined over $F$, let $P$ and $Q$ be two parabolic subgroups with the same Levi factor $M$. We construct intertwining operators $J_{Q|P}$ and the Harish-Chandra $j$-function $j^G$ for finitely generated smooth $A[M]$-modules, where $A$ is any commutative Noetherian algebra over $\mathbb{Z}' :=\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{q}^{-1}]$. The construction is functorial, compatible with extension of scalars, and generalizes the previously known constructions. We prove a generic Schur's lemma result for parabolic induction, which circumvents the need for generic irreducibility in defining $j^G$. Setting $A=\mathbb{Z}'$ and applying the construction to finitely generated projective generators produces a universal $j$-function that is a rational function with coefficients in the Bernstein center of $M$ over $\mathbb{Z}'$, and which gives the $j$-function of any object via specializing at points of the Bernstein scheme. We conclude by characterizing the local Langlands in families morphism (when it exists) for quasisplit classical groups in terms of an equality of $j$-functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $L/K$ be a cyclic extension of number fields, and let $S$ be a finite set of places of $K$ containing the ramified and Archimedean ones. We say that $L/K$ has the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property if, for any generator $\sigma \in \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$, the kernel of the arithmetic norm map $\mathrm{cl}^S(L)\rightarrow \mathrm{cl}^S(K)$ coincides with $(1-\sigma)\mathrm{cl}^S(L)$. We establish an effective criterion for the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property and investigate its connections with Iwasawa theory, in particular its relation to the Gross--Kuz'min conjecture. This yields a new method for verifying the property by explicit computation, with further links to the theory of spins of prime ideals.

Assume that $E$ has potentially multiplicative reduction. We classify when all $G_{\mathbb{Q}_\ell}$-isomorphisms $\phi : E[p] \to E'[p]$ have the same symplectic type and prove two new criteria to determine the type in that case. In particular, when both curves have multiplicative reduction, our results cover the case of unramified $p$-torsion which is not covered by the original criterion due to Kraus and Oesterl\'e. We also give a variant of a symplectic criterion for the case when both $E$ and~$E'$ have good reduction and provide an algorithm to apply it. As an application, we determine the symplectic type of all the mod $p \geq 5$ congruences between rational elliptic curves with conductor $\leq 500 000$ that satisfy the hypothesis of either of our criteria at some prime~$\ell$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The moduli space $\mathcal{A}_g$ of principally polarised abelian varieties of dimension $g$, defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p >0$, is studied through various stratifications. The two most prominent ones are the Newton polygon stratification, based on the isogeny class of the $p$-divisible group of an abelian variety, and the Ekedahl-Oort stratification, defined by the isomorphism class of its $p$-torsion group scheme. In general, it is not known how the strata of these two intersect. In this paper we study intersections of the Ekedahl-Oort and Newton polygon stratification in dimension at most $5$. We give an explicit description of the Ekedahl-Oort stratification of the supersingular locus $\mathcal{S}_{5}$, and describe other $p$-rank zero intersections of the two stratifications. For intersections of positive $p$-rank, we describe all such intersections in dimensions at most $5$. Our proofs use Oort's minimality of $p$-divisible groups, as well as related results of Chai-Oort and Harashita. In addition to these, a new approach used in this paper is an inductive argument, based on understanding the Ekedahl-Oort type of products of abelian varieties and the known intersections in lower dimensions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** No figures. Includes a short appendix on a uniform short-interval BDH mean-square bound and a congruence-restricted dense-cluster lemma

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that once $\theta>17/30$, every sufficiently long interval $[x,x+x^\theta]$ contains many $k$-term arithmetic progressions of primes, uniformly in the starting point $x$. More precisely, for each fixed $k\ge3$ and $\theta>17/30$, for all sufficiently large $X$ and all $x\in[X,2X]$, $$ \#\{\text{$k$-APs of primes in }[x,x+x^\theta]\}\ \gg_{k,\theta}\ \frac{N^{2}}{\big((\varphi(W)/W)^{k}(\log R)^{k}\big)}\ \asymp\ \frac{X^{2\theta}}{(\log X)^{k+1+o(1)}}, $$ where $W:=\prod_{p\le \tfrac12\log\log X}p$, $N:=\lfloor x^\theta/W\rfloor$, and $R:=N^\eta$ for a small fixed $\eta=\eta(k,\theta)>0$. This is obtained by combining the uniform short-interval prime number theorem at exponents $\theta>17/30$ (a consequence of recent zero-density estimates of Guth and Maynard) with the Green-Tao transference principle (in the relative Szemer\'edi form) on a window-aligned $W$-tricked block. We also record a concise Maynard-type lemma on dense clusters \emph{restricted to a fixed congruence class} in tiny intervals $(\log x)^\varepsilon$, which we use as a warm-up and for context. An appendix contains a short-interval Barban-Davenport-Halberstam mean square bound (uniform in $x$) that we use as a black box for variance estimates. The proofs in this paper were assisted by GPT-5.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study several rigidity properties of $p$-adic local systems on a smooth rigid analytic space $X$ over a $p$-adic field. We prove that the monodromy of the log isocrystal attached to a $p$-adic local system is ''rigid'' along irreducible components of the special fiber. Then we give several applications. First, suppose that $X$ has good reduction. We show that if a family of semistable representations is crystalline at one classical point on $X$, then it is crystalline everywhere. Second, combining with the $p$-adic monodromy theorem recently studied by the authors and their collaborators, we prove the following surprising rigidity result conjectured by Shankar: for any $p$-adic local system on a smooth projective variety with good reduction, if it is potentially crystalline at one classical point, then it is potentially crystalline everywhere. Finally, we show that if a $p$-adic local system on the complement of a reduced normal crossing divisor on a smooth rigid analytic space is crystalline at all classical points, then it extends uniquely to a $p$-adic local system on the entire space. In other words, such a local system cannot have geometric monodromy if it has no arithmetic monodromy everywhere on the complement of a reduced normal crossing divisor.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We generalize Derksen-Weyman-Zelevinsky's theory of quivers with potentials (QPs) to an $H$-based setting by considering quivers with exactly one loop at each vertex, asking the loops to be nilpotent and so attaching a truncated polynomial ring $H_i$ to each vertex. The algebra is then defined by taking the quotient of the complete path algebra by relations arising from analogs of the Jacobian ideals of a given potential. We develop the mutation theory for such $H$-based QPs and their decorated representations in general position. As an application, we consider generalized cluster algebras introduced by Chekhov-Shapiro. For those algebras corresponding to $H$-based quivers $(Q,\mathbf{d})$ that have mutation degree $d_k\leq 2$ at each vertex $k$ and admit nondegenerate potentials $S$ making $(Q,\mathbf{d},S)$ locally free, we provide a representation-theoretic interpretation of $\mathbf{g}$-vectors and $F$-polynomials. When the exchange matrix $B(Q)$ has full rank, we further construct generic character for upper generalized cluster algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that $\kgl$-linear cohomology theories over an affine Dedekind scheme $S$ admit a canonical weight filtration on resolvable motives without inverting residual characteristics. Combined with upcoming work of Annala--Hoyois--Iwasa, this endows essentially all known logarithmic cohomology theories with weight filtrations when evaluated on projective sncd pairs $(X,D)$ over $S$. Furthermore, the weight-filtered cohomology is an invariant of the open part $U = X-D$. On variants of de Rham cohomology, we show that our weight filtration recovers the d\'ecalaged pole-order filtration defined by Deligne. One interpretation of this is that the spectral sequence associated to the pole-order filtration is an invariant of $U$ from the $E_2$-page onwards, which generalizes a result of Deligne from characteristic 0 to positive and mixed characteristic, and suggests that ``mixed Hodge theory'' is a useful invariant of $S$-schemes. Finally, we compute explicit examples of weight filtered pieces of cohomology theories. One of the computations reproves a slight weakening of a result of Thuillier stating that the singular cohomology of the dual complex associated to the boundary divisor of a good projective compactification does not depend on the chosen compactification. In the appendix, we prove the folklore results that the Whitehead tower functor is fully faithful and that perfect bivariant pairings with respect to the twisted arrow category correspond to duality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Majorization inequalities have a long history, going back to Maclaurin and Newton. They were recently studied for several families of symmetric functions, including by Cuttler--Greene--Skandera (2011), Sra (2016), Khare--Tao (2021), McSwiggen--Novak (2022), and Chen--Sahi (2024+) among others. Here we extend the inequalities by these authors to Jack and Macdonald polynomials, and obtain conjectural characterizations of majorization and of weak majorization of the underlying partitions. We prove these characterizations for several cases of partitions, including all partitions with two parts. In fact, we upgrade -- and prove in the above cases -- the characterization of majorization, to containment of Jack and Macdonald differences lying in the Muirhead semiring.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Harder-Narasimhan theory provides a canonical filtration of a vector bundle on a projective curve whose successive quotients are semistable with strictly decreasing slopes. In this article, we present the formalization of Harder-Narasimhan theory in the proof assistant Lean 4 with Mathlib. This formalization is based on a recent approach of Harder-Narasimhan theory by Chen and Jeannin, which reinterprets the theory in order-theoretic terms and avoids the classical dependence on algebraic geometry. As an application, we formalize the uniqueness of coprimary filtration of a finitely generated module over a noetherian ring, and the existence of the Jordan-H\"older filtration of a semistable Harder-Narasimhan game.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We formulate several basic properties of Verma supermodules over regular symmetrizable Kac--Moody Lie superalgebras, exhibiting $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$-nature as revealed through changing Borel subalgebras. We investigate variants of Verma modules obtained by changing Borel subalgebras, which enable us to realize the principal block of $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ as an extension-closed abelian subcategory of category $\mathcal{O}$. This phenomenon is precisely formulated in terms of semibricks. On the other hand, by applying the exchange property of odd reflections, we describe compositions of homomorphisms between Verma modules associated with different Borel subalgebras that share the same character. As an application, we refine existing results on the associated varieties and projective dimensions of Verma modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the partition function of the WZW model with target a compact Lie group $G$ by adapting a method used by Choi and Takhtajan to compute the heat kernel of the group manifold. The basic idea is to compute the partition function of a supersymmetric version of the WZW model using a form of supersymmetric localization and then use the fact that, since the fermions of the supersymmetric WZW model are actually decoupled from the bosons, this also determines the partition function of the purely bosonic WZW model. The result is a formula for the partition function as a sum over contributions from abelian classical solutions. We verify for $G=SU(2)$ that this formula agrees with the result for the same partition function that comes from the Weyl-Kac character formula. We extend the method of supersymmetric localization to certain related models such as the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ WZW model and a Wick-rotated version of this model in which the target space is hyperbolic three-space $H_3^+$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A proof of Lagrange's and Jacobi's four-square theorem due to Hurwitz utilizes orders in a quaternion algebra over the rationals. Seeking a generalization of this technique to orders over number fields, we identify two key components: an order with a good factorization theory and the condition that all orbits under the action of the group of elements of norm $1$ acting by multiplication intersect the suborder corresponding to the quadratic form to be studied. We use recent results on class numbers of quaternion orders and then find all suborders satisfying the orbit condition. Subsequently, we obtain universality and formulas for the number of representations by the corresponding quadratic forms. We also present a quaternionic proof of G\"otzky's four-square theorem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Despite the prevalence of symmetry in scientific linear systems, these structural properties are often underutilized by standard computational software. This paper introduces PySymmetry, an open-source Sage/Python framework that implements classical representation theory to simplify G-equivariant linear systems. PySymmetry uses projection operators to generate symmetry-adapted bases, transforming equivariant operators into a more efficient block-diagonal form. Its functionalities include defining and reducing representations, calculating multiplicities, and obtaining the explicit block structure. We demonstrate PySymmetry's versatility through three case studies: a chemistry application, a numerical benchmark on the non-Hermitian Schr\"odinger equation that achieved a performance increase of over 17x compared to standard methods, and a symbolic investigation that enabled the first complete analytical classification of a challenging problem in celestial mechanics. Designed for seamless integration with libraries like NumPy and SciPy, PySymmetry offers a powerful, user-friendly tool for exploring symmetries in theoretical and applied contexts. ```</p></details>

> **Comment:** 44 pages. Presentation improved and some additional content added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study categories whose objects are the braid representations, i.e. strict monoidal functors $F\colon B\rightarrow Mat$ from the braid category $B$ to the category of matrices $Mat$. Braid representations are equivalent to solutions to the (constant) Yang-Baxter equation. A major part of the contribution here is to introduce, compare, and contrast suitable notions of isomorphism of representations. A significant contribution here is an extensive range of key examples and counterexamples. Our approach is mainly motivated by the recent classification of charge conserving Yang-Baxter operators, in which the target $Mat$ is replaced by the subcategory $Match^N$. One objective is to understand from the categorical perspective how the classification was facilitated by this change (with the aim of generalising). Progress is made here by observing that the category of functors $MonFun(B,Mat)$ is itself a monoidal category (Theorem 5.3). In addition, we introduce the notion of sub and quotient objects, proving that an object that is both sub and quotient corresponds to an endomorphism in $MonFun(B,Mat)$ (Theorem 5.18). We also observe that objects with target $Match^N$ always have sub and quotient objects. This monoidal category leads us to consider monoidal subcategories whose objects share a given property, giving rise to a new way to see how group-type and involutive solutions, for example, fit into our framework. Another objective is to understand how universal such a restricted target is. Here we give various properties exposing the implications of different choices of equivalence and describe some relationships among them (Theorem 7.18, Theorem 7.9, Conj. 7.19, Conj. 7.22). A key result of this paper is Th.2.9, which shows that, in a `sufficiently free' setting including our case, every monoidal functor is equivalent to a strict one.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Walled Brauer algebras $B_N ( m , n ) $ illuminate the combinatorics of mixed tensor representations of $U(N)$, with $m$ copies of the fundamental and $n$ copies of the anti-fundamental representation. They lie at the intersection of research in representation theory, AdS/CFT and quantum information theory. They have been used to study of correlators in multi-matrix models motivated by brane-anti-brane physics in AdS/CFT. They have been applied in computing and optimising fidelities of port-based quantum teleportation. There is a large $N$ regime, specifically $ N \ge (m+n)$ where the algebras are semi-simple and their representation theory more tractable. There are known combinatorial formulae for dimensions of irreducible representations and associated reduction multiplicities. The large $N$ regime has a stability property whereby these formulae are independent of $N$. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the combinatorics in the non-semisimple regime of $ N = m +n - l $, with positive $l$. We introduce restricted Bratteli diagrams (RBD) which are useful as an instrument to process known data from the large $N$ regime to calculate representation theory data in the non-semisimple regime. We identify within the non-semisimple regime, a region of $(m,n)$-stability, where $ \min ( m, n ) \ge ( 2l -3) $ and the RBD take a stable form depending on $l$ only and not the choice of $ m,n$ within the region. In this regime, several aspects of the combinatorics of the RBD are controlled by a universal partition function for an infinite tower of simple harmonic oscillators closely related, but not identical, to the partition function of 2D non-chiral free scalar field theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\cP$ be the set of prime numbers, and $X_p,\, p\in\cP$ be a sequence of independent random variables such that $\bbP(X_p=\pm 1)=1/2$. Let $(\te_j)_{j=1}^{\infty}$ the corresponding random multiplicative functions of Radamacher type, namely, $\te_j=\prod_{p|j}X_p$ if $j$ is square free and $\te_j=0$ otherwise. The motivation behind considering these variables comes from the Riemann Hypothesis since $(\te_\ell)$ can be viewed as the random counterpart of the M\"obius function $\mu(\ell)$ and the RH is equivalent to $\sum_{\ell\leq n}\mu(\ell)=o(n^{1/2+\varepsilon}), \forall \varepsilon>0$. Denote $S_n=\sum_{\ell=1}^n\te_\ell$. It is a natural guiding conjecture that $S_n/\sqrt n$ obeys the central limit theorem (CLT). However, S. Chatterjee conjectured (as expressed in \cite{[25]}) that the CLT should not hold. Chatterjee's conjecture was proved by Harper \cite{[17]}, and by now it is a direct consequence of a more recent breakthrough by Harper \cite{Har20} that $\frac{S_n}{\sqrt n}\to 0$ in distribution. Nevertheless, the question whether there exists a sequence $a_n=o(\sqrt n)$ such that $S_n/a_n$ converges to some limit remains a mystery. In this paper we, in particular, show that the answer is negative. Our proof is based on trigonometric identities, Levi's continuity theorem, the prime numbers theorem and the growth rates of the prime omega function $\om(n)$. Combining these tools we show that if a weak limit exists then the characteristic function of $S_n/a_n$ must converge to $0$ at any nonzero point. As a byproduct of our method we are also able to provide essentially optimal upper bounds on high order moments similar to \cite{Har19}, using different methods and for more general $X_p$'s.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Geil-Matsumoto bound (GM bound) constrains the number of rational points on a curve over a finite field in terms of the Weierstrass semigroup of any of the points on the curve. For general numerical semigroups, the GM bound lacks a simple closed-form expression, making its computation a challenging problem. A closed formula has been obtained for the case when the semigroup is generated by two co-prime integers. In this work, for any numerical semigroup, we provide a closed formula for the GM bound in terms of the Ap\'ery set of a nonzero element of the semigroup. In the case where the numerical semigroup is generated by consecutive integers $n, n+1, \dots, n+t$ with $\lceil\textstyle\frac{n-1}{2}\rceil\leq t \leq n-1$, we obtain a simple closed formula for the bound. We apply these results to obtain upper bounds on the number of rational points for algebraic curves over finite fields. In some cases, the GM bound improves some well-known upper bounds on the number of rational points.</p></details>

Under this isomorphism, we show that the relative braid group action on this iweight space coincides with the action of the type B Hecke algebra in the iSchur duality. As a consequence, we derive from multiplicity-free decompositions that the iweight $\overline{\rho}$ spaces of irreducible modules over iquantum groups are irreducible modules over the type B Hecke algebra. Meanwhile, in the iHowe duality, we identify the relative braid group action from one side with the action of $K$-matrices and $R$-matrices from the other side.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages. New version improves the exponent to 1/7, and proves polynomial bounds for general cosine polynomials with coefficients in an arbitrary finite set

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A\subset \mathbf{N}$ be a finite set of $n=|A|$ positive integers, and consider the cosine sum $f_A(x)=\sum_{a\in A}\cos ax$. We prove that $$\min_x f_A(x)\leqslant -n^{ 1/7-o(1)},$$ thereby establishing polynomial bounds for the Chowla cosine problem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe the center of quantum tori appearing in quantum higher Teichm\"uller theory when the quantum parameter is an even root of unity. This is a subsequent of the work in the odd roots of unity case. The centers of the quantum tori help to understand those of (reduced) stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras via quantum trace maps. Moreover, we compute the PI-degree of the quantum tori, which are the same with those of (reduced) stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras. As corollaries, we give matrix decompositions for anti-symmetric integer matrices for the quantum tori.</p></details>

> **Comment:** It replaces the manuscript titled "Emerton-Gee stacks for tame groups, II"

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct the parabolic version and the reductive version of the integral de Rham moduli stacks of Langlands parameters ($p>3$). We allow the group to be arbitrarily ramified. We propose that the top Chow group of the reduced Emerton-Gee stack $\mathcal{X}_{^L\!G}$ is isomorphic to that of the moduli of Weil-Deligne representations valued in $^L\!B$, where $^L\!B$ is a Borel of $^L\!G$. The latter bears a concrete description by Serre weights corrected by the Kottwitz homomorphism. We explicitly define such a map using parabolic de Rham moduli stacks as the composition of a chain of tautological maps, and confirm it is an isomorphism for (1) algebraic tori, (2) unitary, orthogonal and symplectic groups, (3) tame groups when restricted to the cyclotomic-free part of the Chow groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We are motivated by a result of Alzer and Luca who presented all the integer solutions to the relations $(k!)^n-k^n=(n!)^k-n^k$ and $(k!)^n+k^n=(n!)^k+n^k$. We consider the equations $(k!)^{n!}\pm k^n=(n!)^{k!}\pm n^k$ and $(k!)^n\pm k^{n!}=(n!)^k\pm n^{k!}$ and prove a similar statement.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study function fields of curves over a base field $K$ which is either a global field or a large field having a separable field extension of degree divisible by $4$. We show that, for any such function field, Hilbert's 10th Problem has a negative answer, the valuation rings containing $K$ are uniformly existentially definable, and finitely generated integrally closed $K$-subalgebras are definable by a universal-existential formula. In order to obtain these results, we develop further the usage of local-global principles for quadratic forms in function fields to definability of certain subrings. We include a first systematic presentation of this general method, without restriction on the characteristic.</p></details>
