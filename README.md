<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this short note we show that every connected reductive simply-connected algebraic group of rank $>1$ over the complex numbers has infinitely many pairs of irreducible representations which are not related by an automorphism of the algebraic group and which have the same degree. This answers a question I was asked by J.~P.~Serre.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that for all integers $2\le s\le t$, any $K_{s,t}$-free subset of $[N]$ with size $Ω(n^{1-1/s})$ must contain a nontrivial solution to every fixed translation-invariant linear equation in at least five variables. This extends earlier results for Sidon sets due to Conlon-Fox-Sudakov-Zhao and Prendiville to the full family of $K_{s,t}$-free sets. We also study the corresponding problem in vector spaces over finite fields. In $\mathbb F_q^n$ we obtain stronger quantitative bounds, including polylogarithmic savings, by combining Fourier-analytic transference with polynomial-method input from the arithmetic cycle-removal lemma of Fox-Lovász-Sauermann.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Catharina Stroppel, Liao Wang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a theory of weights for a quantum analogue of the symmetric pair (gl4,gl2 x gl2) realised as a quantum symmetric pair subalgebra. Based on Letzter's triangular decomposition we define Verma modules. Using magical operators that are compatible with weight spaces, we classify weight Verma modules and characterise their irreducible finite dimensional quotients. We then prove the existence of weight bases in tensor products by explicitly constructing some highest weight vectors. These constructions allow us to mimic the important aspects of the classical finite dimensional representation theory. Applications include a definition of rational representations, the BGG resolution, a Clebsch--Gordan formula, the Harish-Chandra isomorphism and central characters, as well as a classification and description of all irreducible polynomial representations.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nat Sothanaphan &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a writeup of a resolution of Erdős Problem #728; this is the first Erdős problem (a problem proposed by Paul Erdős which has been collected in the Erdős Problems website) regarded as fully resolved autonomously by an AI system. The system in question is a combination of GPT-5.2 Pro by OpenAI and Aristotle by Harmonic, operated by Kevin Barreto. The final result of the system is a formal proof written in Lean, which we translate to informal mathematics in the present writeup for wider accessibility. The proved result is as follows. We show a logarithmic-gap phenomenon regarding factorial divisibility: For any constants $0<C_1<C_2$ and $0 < \varepsilon < 1/2$ there exist infinitely many triples $(a,b,n)\in\mathbb N^3$ with $\varepsilon n \le a,b \le (1-\varepsilon)n$ such that $$ a!\,b!\mid n!\,(a+b-n)!\qquad\text{and}\qquad C_1\log n < a+b-n < C_2\log n. $$ The argument reduces this to a binomial divisibility $\binom{m+k}{k}\mid\binom{2m}{m}$ and studies it prime-by-prime. By Kummer's theorem, $ν_p\binom{2m}{m}$ translates into a carry count for doubling $m$ in base $p$. We then employ a counting argument to find, in each scale $[M,2M]$, an integer $m$ whose base-$p$ expansions simultaneously force many carries when doubling $m$, for every prime $p\le 2k$, while avoiding the rare event that one of $m+1,\dots,m+k$ is divisible by an unusually high power of $p$. These "carry-rich but spike-free" choices of $m$ force the needed $p$-adic inequalities and the divisibility. The overall strategy is similar to results regarding divisors of $\binom{2n}{n}$ studied earlier by Erdős and by Pomerance.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18691v1'>2601.18691</a>\]&nbsp; **On the Distance Distribution of Reed-Muller Codes**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Neil Kolekar &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we give error bounds for the distance distribution of Reed-Muller codes, extending prior work on the distance distribution of Reed-Solomon codes. This is equivalent to the problem of counting multivariate polynomials over a finite field with prescribed degree, coefficients, and number of zeroes. We provide a solution to this problem using the character sum method, which offers a new unified framework applicable to a broad class of polynomial enumeration problems over finite fields that involve prescribed evaluation vectors. This work effectively makes the first systematic attempt to study the coset weight distribution problem for Reed-Muller codes of fixed degree over large finite fields, which was proposed in MacWilliams and Sloane's 1977 textbook \emph{The Theory of Error Correcting Codes}.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ralph Furmaniak &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a single explicit entire function $Ξ_c(s)$ of order 1, with all zeros provably on $Re(s) = 1/2$, satisfying a functional equation $Ξ_c(s) = Ξ_c(1-s)$, whose normalized form $Z_c(s) = Ξ_c(s)/[\tfrac{1}{2}s(s-1)π^{-s/2}Γ(s/2)]$ is uniformly bounded for $Re(s) > 1 + δ$ yet satisfies $\sup_t|Z_c(1+it)| = +\infty$. The function thus satisfies an analogue of the Riemann Hypothesis together with the sharp bounded/unbounded transition at $σ= 1$ characteristic of $ζ$. The construction uses Hadamard products with controlled zero perturbations; the transition is proved unconditionally via a dyadic large-sieve argument and a Phragmén-Lindelöf transfer.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Felipe Gonçalves &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We completely classify Fourier summation formulas, and in particular, all crystalline measures with quadratic decay. Our classification employs techniques from almost periodic functions, Hermite-Biehler functions, de Branges spaces and Poisson representation. We show how our classification generalizes recent results of Kurasov \& Sarnak and Olevskii \& Ulanovskii. As an application, we give a new classification result for nonnegative measures with uniformly discrete support that are bounded away from zero on their support. Moreover, we give a new construction using eta-quotients, generalizing an old example of Guinand.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Rahul Kumar, Nargish Punia &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study various classes of partition functions such as those related to the parity of the number of parts, to differences of partition numbers, and to partitions with a repeated smallest part. We establish identities connecting these various classes of partitions. Moreover, our identities help us to extend the Euler's partition theorem. An analogue of Legendre's theorem of the partition-theoretic interpretation of Euler's pentagonal number theorem is also derived. Both combinatorial and $q$-series proofs are given for our results.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18645v1'>2601.18645</a>\]&nbsp; **On series identities involving $\binom{4k}k$ and harmonic numbers**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Bo Jiang, Zhi-Wei Sun &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The harmonic numbers are those $H_n=\sum_{0<k\le n}\frac1k\ (n=0,1,2,\ldots)$. In this paper we confirm over ten conjectural series identities with summands involving the binomial coefficient $\binom{4k}k$ and harmonic numbers. For example, we prove the identities $$\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{\binom{4k}{k}}{16^k}\left((22k^2-92k+11)H_{4k}-\frac{449k-275}{2}-\frac{85}{12k}\right)=-151-\frac{80}{3}\log{2}$$ and $$ \sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{\binom{4k}{k}((11k^2+8k+1)(10H_{4k}-17H_{2k})+2k+18)}{(3k+1)(3k+2)16^k}=8\log2,$$ which were previously conjectured by Z.-W. Sun.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Woojin Choi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 54 pages, 31 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A. Bondal introduced a symplectic groupoid of triangular bilinear forms. This induces the Poisson structure on $\mathcal{A}_n$, the space of $n \times n$ unipotent upper-triangular matrices. L. Chekhov and M. Shapiro described log-canonical coordinates on this symplectic groupoid via the $\mathcal{A}_n$-quiver. In this paper, we introduce a birational Weyl group action on the symplectic groupoid. It is generated by cluster transformations associated with certain cycles of the quiver. We prove that every matrix entry of $\mathcal{A}_n$ is invariant under this action. Conversely, we prove that matrix entries generate the Poisson subalgebra of Weyl group invariants in the ring of regular functions on the cluster variety $\mathcal X_{|\mathcal A_n|}$. V. Fock and L. Chekhov defined a Poisson map $φ_n$ from the Teichmüller space $\mathcal{T}_{g,s}$ with genus $g$ and $s \in \{1,2\}$ boundary components into $\mathcal{A}_n$. We aim to describe the cluster structure of $\text{Im}(φ_n)$ by applying a Hamiltonian reduction to $\mathcal A_n$. Since every element in $\text{Im}(φ_n)$ satisfies the rank condition $\text{rank}(A+A^T) \le 4$, it provides a natural criterion for our Hamiltonian reduction. The solution set of the rank condition has distinct irreducible components, so the reduction might be component-dependent. However, we show that the Weyl group acts transitively on these components. This implies that the Hamiltonian reductions are conjugate; thus, it suffices to determine the reduction on a single component. Furthermore, we prove that the longest element of the Weyl group corresponds to a cluster DT-transformation on the $\mathcal{A}_{2k}$-quiver. In contrast, we show that no reddening sequence exists for odd $n$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** M. V. Pratsiovytyi, S. P. Ratushniak, Yu. Yu. Vovk, Ya. V. Goncharenko &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For fixed natural numbers $r$ and $s$, where $2\leq s \leq r$, we consider a representation of numbers from the interval $[0;\frac{r}{s-1}]$ obtained by encoding numbers by means of the alphabet $A=\{0,1,...,r\}$ via the expansion $x=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}s^{-n}α_n=Δ^{r_s}_{α_1α_2...α_n...}.$ The algorithm for expanding a number into such a series is justified in the paper. The geometry of this representation is studied, including the geometric meaning of digits, properties of cylinder sets -- particularly the specificity of their overlaps -- and metric relations, as well as the connection between the representation and partial sums of the corresponding series. The paper also presents results on the study of a function $f$ defined by $f(x=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{α_n}{(r+1)^n})=Δ^{r_s}_{α_1α_2...α_n...}, α_n\in A.$ It is proved that the function $f$ is continuous at every point that has a unique representation in the classical numeration system with base $r+1$, and discontinuous at points having two representations. The function has unbounded variation and a self-affine graph. For $r<2s-1$, the function possesses singleton, finite, countable, and continuum level sets, including fractal ones; for $r>2s-2$, every level set is a continuum, and moreover it is fractal or anomalously fractal.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Shannon Starr &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 14 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The d'Arcais numbers are the triangular array $\{A(2,n,k)\, :\, n=0,1,\dots,\, k=0,\dots,n\}$, such that $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{n} A(2,n,k) x^k z^n/n! = ((z;z)_{\infty})^{-x}$. The infinite $q$-Pochhammer symbol is $(q;q)_{\infty} = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1-q^n)$. Holding $k$ fixed and considering large $n$, we note that the ratio $k! A(2,n,k)/n!$ is asymptotic to $C(k) σ_{2k-1}(n)/n^k$ where the divisor sum function is $σ_p(n) = \sum_{d|n} d^p$ and $C(k) = (ζ(2))^k/(Γ(k) ζ(2k))$. This is a slightly generalized version of one of Ramanujan's formulas from his paper, ``On Certain Arithmetical Functions," and it is an immediate consequence of the more recent article of Oliver, Shreshta and Thorne. Heim and Neuhauser made a conjecture, that $A(2,n,k)/A(2,n,k-1)$ is greater than or equal to $A(2,n,k+1)/A(2,n,k)$, for $k=2,3,\dots$ and all $n$. The conjecture is false for $k=2$, and it is true for $k=3,4,\dots$ when $n$ is sufficiently large. We consider the Hardy-Ramanujan circle method as a heuristic step.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Anna Theorin Johansson &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the Hasse principle for Diophantine systems consisting of one diagonal form of degree $k$ and one general form of degree $k-1$. By refining the method of Brandes and Parsell (arXiv:2003.04350) in this specific setting, we improve the bound $n > 2^k k$ to $n > 2^{k-1}(2k-1)$; in particular, the requirement $n > 24$ in the case of degrees three and two is relaxed to $n > 20$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03272v4'>2412.03272</a>\]&nbsp; **Locally analytic vectors and $\mathbf{Z}_p$-extensions**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Léo Poyeton &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbf{Q}_p$ and let $\mathcal{G}_K = \mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbf{Q}_p}/K)$. Lately, interest has risen around a generalization of the theory of $(\varphi,Γ)$-modules, replacing the cyclotomic extension with an arbitrary infinitely ramified $p$-adic Lie extension. Computations from Berger suggest that locally analytic vectors should provide such a generalization for any arbitrary infinitely ramified $p$-adic Lie extension, and this has been conjectured by Kedlaya. In this paper, we focus on the case of $\mathbf{Z}_p$-extensions, using recent work of Berger-Rozensztajn and Porat on an integral version of locally analytic vectors and explain what can be the structure of the locally analytic vectors in the higher rings of periods $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}^{\dagger}$ in this setting. We show that the existence of nontrivial locally analytic vectors in $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}^{\dagger}$, a necessary condition for Kedlaya's conjecture to hold, is equivalent to the existence of an overconvergent lift of the field of norms attached to the $\mathbf{Z}_p$-extension. Finally, in the case where $K/\mathbf{Q}_p$ is unramified, we are able to prove that the only extensions for which such nontrivial locally analytic vectors exist are exactly the twisted cyclotomic extensions, up to a finite extension. In particular, this disproves Kedlaya's conjecture and also shows that there is no overconvergent lift of the field of norms in the anticyclotomic setting.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Alexander Rybalov &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.LO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won introduced power circuits in 2012 to construct a polynomial algorithm for the word problem in the Baumslag group, which has a non-elementary Dehn function. Power circuits are circuits supporting addition and operation $(x,y) = x \cdot 2^y$ for integer numbers. Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won posed a question about decidability of the Diophantine problem over the structure $\langle \mathbb{N}_{>0}; +, x \cdot 2^y, \leq, 1 \rangle$, which is closely related to power circuits. In this paper we prove undecidability of the Diophantine problem over this structure.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define and study "tautological classes" in the cohomology of moduli stacks of shtukas, pursuing two directions of applications. First, we prove a formula relating the "arithmetic volume" of tautological classes to higher derivatives of Artin $L$-functions, which can be viewed as an arithmetic analog of Hirzebruch's Proportionality principle. Second, we define and analyze the structure of the "phantom tautological ring", using a general relation between Hecke correspondences and Vinberg's degeneration, and give applications to a function field analog of Colmez's Conjecture.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2: Results extended to the case when the lattice is odd, title and abstract changed. 24 pages, 10 figures. Comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the zeros of theta functions $Θ_{Γ_{4k}}$ associated with the lattices $Γ_{4k}$, a family of self-dual lattices generalizing the $\mathsf{E}_{8}$ lattice. Our results show two different behaviors of the zeros according to the lattice parity: When $Γ_{4k}$ is an even lattice, we show that the zeros all lie on the line $\Re z =\frac{1}{2}$ in the fundamental domain and prove that the zeros are equidistributed with respect to an explicit probability measure on the line $\Re z = \frac{1}{2}$. However, when the $Γ_{4k}$ is an odd lattice, there are no zeros on the line $\Re z =\frac{1}{2}$, only exponentially close to it. Our argument relies on representing $Θ_{Γ_{4k}}$ as a polynomial in the modular $λ$-function. We then study the zeros of this polynomial and exploit some conformal properties of $λ$ to get our results.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Divya Setia &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the tensor product of Demazure crystals for symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebras. It is not necessary that the tensor product of Demazure crystals is isomorphic to a disjoint union of Demazure crystals. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the decomposition of the tensor product of Demazure crystals as a disjoint union of Demazure crystals. Our results are the generalization of the results proved by Anthony Joseph and Takafumi Kouno. As an application, we obtain a sufficient condition when the product of Demazure characters is a linear combination of Demazure characters with nonnegative integer coefficients. In particular, we obtain a partial solution for the key positivity problem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Relatively little is known about the arithmetic properties of Gamma-function derivatives evaluated at arbitrary points $q\in\mathbb{Q}\setminus\mathbb{Z}_{\leq0}$. In recent work, we showed that elements of the sequence $\left\{ Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(1\right)\right\} _{n\geq1}$ are transcendental infinitely often. This result is now generalized to all sequences $\left\{ Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(q\right)\right\} _{n\geq1}$ for $q\in\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}\setminus\mathbb{Z}_{\leq0}$. Furthermore, for $q\in\mathbb{Q}\setminus\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}$ we show that at least one of the sequences $\left\{ Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(q\right)\right\} _{n\geq1}$, $\left\{ Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(1-q\right)\right\} _{n\geq1}$ contains infinitely many transcendental elements.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18433v1'>2601.18433</a>\]&nbsp; **Massless Representations in Conformal Space and Their de Sitter (dS) Restrictions**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jean-Pierre Gazeau, Hamed Pejhan, Ivan Todorov &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math-ph &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Draft monograph / preprint

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The monograph develops a self-contained, mathematically rigorous framework for massless representations of the conformal group U(2,2) and their restriction to the de Sitter group Sp(2,2). It systematically constructs ladder (massless) representations, computes invariant bilinear forms and Casimir operators, and provides explicit constructions of vertex operators and two-point functions for low-helicity fields. The monograph employs a novel Clifford-split-octonion approach, embedding 8-component Majorana spinors within an alternative composition algebra, which allows for fully explicit algebraic, spinorial, and geometric constructions. The text bridges foundational representation theory, explicit computational methods, and physical applications in quantum field theory and cosmology.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical Brauer-Siegel conjecture describes the asymptotic behaviour of the product of the class number and the regulator in families of number fields. All known cases of the conjecture rely on reducing the problem, via group theoretic methods, to Siegel's theorem for quadratic fields over Q or over a fixed base field. In this paper, we establish a new form of descent for the Brauer-Siegel conjecture. We show that if the conjecture holds for a family of almost Sn-fields, it necessarily holds for all quadratic extensions over that family, under mild conditions. This result may be viewed as an analogue of Siegel's theorem in which the base field is allowed to vary. In addition, we also establish the generalized Brauer-Siegel conjecture as formulated by Tsfasman-Vladut for asymptotically good towers of number fields over a family of almost Sn-fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop generalized Petersson/Bruggeman-Kuznetsov (PBK) formulas for specified local components at non-archimedean places. In fact, we introduce two hypotheses on non-archimedean test function pairs $f \leftrightarrow π(f)$, called geometric and spectral hypotheses, under which one obtains `nice' PBK formulas by the adelic relative trace function approach. Then, given a supercuspidal representation $σ$ of ${\rm PGL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$, we study extensively the case that $π(f)$ is a projection onto the line of the newform if $π$ is isomorphc to $σ$ or its unramified quadratic twist, and $π(f) = 0$ otherwise. As a first application, we prove an optimal large sieve inequality for families of automorphic representations that arise in our framework.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to propose and carry out a program which allows us to yield a larger target quantum group of Drinfeld-Jimbo type via grafting two given smaller ones. To this effect, we first set up some basics of a multi-tensor product theory of the generalized double-bosonization construction (see [HH2] for the latter). Such a grafting method, depending on the choice of grafting node in the Dynkin diagram, including rank-induction and type-crossing constructions as special cases, provides a one-stop resolving strategy of the generation question of Majid's quantum tree, which grows up from the root part $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ and decorates with the quantum groups of various Dynkin diagrams (of finite types) as the branches.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$, and let $\mathfrak{m}_K$ be its maximal ideal. The image of the group of principal units $1+\mathfrak{m}_K$ under $p$-adic logarithm plays important role in several areas of number theory. In general, when the ramification index of $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is greater or equal to $p-1$, the precise description of this image is not known. For the cyclotomic extension $K=\mathbb{Q}_p(ζ_p)$ of degree $p-1$, it was previously proved in \cite{MAS} that the image of the annulus region $(1+\mathfrak{m}_K) \setminus (1+\mathfrak{m}_K^2)$ by $p$-adic logarithm is exactly $\mathfrak{m}_K^2$. In this paper, we give a self-contained analytic proof of this result based on explicit $p$-adic logarithmic expansions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2013, Sun conjectured that the partition function $p(n)$ is never a perfect power for $n \geq 2$. Building on this, Merca, Ono, and Tsai recently observed that for any fixed integers $d \geq 0$ and $k \geq 2$, there appear to be only finitely many integers $n$ such that $p(n)$ differs from a perfect $k$th power by at most $d$. Denoting by $M_k(d)$ the largest such $n$, they conjectured that $M_k(d) = o(d^ε)$ for every $ε> 0$. In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic growth of analogs of $M_k(d)$ for a wide class of partition functions. We establish sharp lower bounds and provide heuristics which suggest that $M_k(d)$ in fact grows polylogarithmically in $d$, i.e. of order $\log^2(d)$. More generally, we prove that if $f(n)$ is a suitably random chosen function with asymptotic growth rate similar to that of $p(n)$, then the set of integers $n$ for which $f(n)$ is a perfect power is finite with probability 1.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Since the time of Minkowski a basic problem in number theory has been to find lower bounds for the absolute value $Δ(K)$ of the discriminant of a number field $K$ in terms of the degree $n(K)$ of $K$. In this paper we study another measure of the size of $K$ given by the covering radius $μ(K)$ of the ring of integers $O_K$ of $K$. Here $μ(K)$ is the $L^2$ radius $||V_2(K)||_2$ of the $L^2$ Voronoi cell $V_2(K)$ of $O_K$, where $V_2(K)$ is the set of points in $\mathbb{R} \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}} K$ that are at least as close to the origin as they are to any non-zero element of $O_K$. To put a limit on what lower bounds one can prove for $μ(K)$ in terms of $n(K)$, we study infinite families of $K$ of increasing degree for which $μ(K)$ can be bounded above by an explicit power of $n(K)$. We also study analogous questions when the $L^2$ norm is replaced by the $L^\infty$ norm.</p></details>

We also show that our formulas are uniform with respect to all possible $S$, with a parameter-free uniformity, and we compute the number of quantifiers and a bound for the degree of the defining polynomial.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Landau--Gonek Theorem evaluates $X^ρ$ summed over the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Their result shows great sensitivity to the arithmetic nature of $X$. We prove a related result concerning the sum of $χ(ρ) X^ρ$ over the zeros of zeta, where $χ(s)$ is the term arising in the functional equation for the zeta function. Again, this result depends deeply on whether $X$ is an integer or not. We show the result splits into three cases, depending on whether $X$ is smaller than $T$, about the same size as $T$, or bigger than $T$. The reason this result is useful is that it easily permits the calculation of discrete moments of the Riemann zeta function via the approximate functional equation. As an application of this result, we provide an alternative proof of Shanks' conjecture.</p></details>

Then we establish a Langlands dual description of equivariant coherent sheaves on $T^*(G/K)$ in terms of constructible sheaves on the loop symmetric spaces, generalizing the derived Satake equivalence for reductive groups to quasi-split symmetric spaces. To this end, we prove the derived Satake equivalence for the twisted affine Grassmannians, study ring objects arising from loop symmetric spaces, and explore the formality and fully-faithfulness properties of $!$-pure objects.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Primitive points on the tower of modular curves $X_1(n)$ provide a finite "certificate set" for detecting isolated points above a fixed $j$-invariant: for a non-CM elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$, $j(E)$ arises from an isolated point on some $X_1(N)$ if and only if one of the associated primitive point is isolated. We bound the number $\lvert \mathcal{P}(E)\rvert$ of primitive points in terms of the adelic index $I(E)$ and give criteria as well as an algorithm for uniqueness of primitive point. As an application, every Serre curve has $\lvert \mathcal{P}(E)\rvert =1$; hence Serre curves do not contribute isolated $j$-invariants.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop an explicit theory of formal modular forms over arbitrary number fields $K$, as functions of modular points. We define modular points for $Γ_0({\mathfrak n})$ and $Γ_1({\mathfrak n})$, where the level ${\mathfrak n}$ is an integral ideal of $K$; Hecke operators and generalized Atkin-Lehner operators as functions of modular points; and associated Hecke eigensystems. We show how complete eigensystems may be recovered, uniquely up to unramified quadratic twist, from their restrictions to principal Hecke operators, and we give explicit formulas for principal operators suitable for machine computation. These have been implemented by the author in the case of imaginary quadratic fields, and used in his systematic computation of Bianchi cusp forms, which are available in the L-functions and modular forms database (LMFDB). While our description incorporates the classical theory for $K={\mathbb Q}$, and also extends work of the author and his students for imaginary quadratic fields, it applies to arbitrary number fields, and may be useful in the computation of spaces of automorphic forms for GL$(2,K)$ over number fields, whether via modular symbols or other methods.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is the first paper in a series where we study arithmetic applications of the multiple elliptic Gamma functions originated from mathematical physics. The main purpose of this paper is the introduction of a framework for applications of these functions to Hilbert's 12th problem for general number fields with exactly one complex place following recent work by Bergeron, Charollois and García. Namely, we define geometric families of the multiple elliptic Gamma functions, upgrading the construction carried out by Felder, Henriques, Rossi and Zhu for rank $3$ lattices to lattices of higher ranks. These functions enjoy transformation properties under an action of the special linear group $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ for $n \geq 2$ involving some Bernoulli rational functions as their so-called modularity defect. A second purpose of this paper is to use this collection of Bernoulli rational functions to construct $(n-1)$-cocycles for specific subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ associated to units groups in totally real number fields and use these cocycles to compute partial zeta values at $s=0$.</p></details>

Along the way, we prove Joyce's conjecture on the functorial behaviour of the Donaldson--Thomas perverse sheaves for the attractor Lagrangian correspondence of $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks. This result allows us to construct a parabolic induction map for cohomological Donaldson--Thomas invariants of $G$-local systems on $3$-manifolds for a reductive group $G$, which can be regarded as a $3$-manifold analogue of the Eisenstein series functor in the geometric Langlands program.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical modular polynomial for $j$-invariants describes the relation between two elliptic curves connected by isogenies. This polynomial has been applied to various algorithms in computational number theory, such as point counting on elliptic curves. In addition, computing the modular polynomial itself is also an important problem, and various algorithms to compute it have been proposed. On the other hand, modular polynomials for other invariants of higher level structures have also been studied. For example, the modular polynomials for the Legendre $λ$-invariant and the Weber functions are well-known. In this paper, we give another approach to construct modular polynomials of higher level purely algebraically. In particular, we show the existence of modular polynomials for invariants directly related to models of elliptic curves, such as the coefficients of Montgomery and Hessian curves. We also show that these modular polynomials have integer coefficients and are symmetric and irreducible in certain cases, and give an algorithm to compute them, which is based on the deformation method by Kunzweiler and Robert.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct three-dimensional non-semisimple topological field theories from the unrolled quantum group of the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(1 \vert 2)$. More precisely, the quantum group depends on a root of unity $q=e^{\frac{2 π\sqrt{-1}}{r}}$, where $r$ is a positive integer greater than $2$, and the construction applies when $r$ is not congruent to $4$ modulo $8$. The algebraic result which underlies the construction is the existence of a relative modular structure on the non-finite, non-semisimple category of weight modules for the quantum group. We prove a Verlinde formula which allows for the computation of dimensions and Euler characteristics of topological field theory state spaces of unmarked surfaces. When $r$ is congruent to $\pm 1$ or $\pm 2$ modulo $8$, we relate the resulting $3$-manifold invariants with physicists' $\widehat{Z}$-invariants associated to $\mathfrak{osp}(1 \vert 2)$. Finally, we establish a relation between $\widehat{Z}$-invariants associated to $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{osp}(1 \vert 2)$ which was conjectured in the physics literature.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A \subseteq \{0,1,\dots,N\}$ be a random set in which each element is included independently with probability $p=p(N)$. Fix an integer $h \geq 2$ and a linear form $$L(x_1,\dots,x_h) := u_1x_1 + \cdots + u_hx_h.$$ We study the random image set \begin{align*} L(A) = \left\{ L(a_1,\dots,a_h) : a_i \in A \right\}, \end{align*} inside the feasible interval of values of $L$ on $\{0,1,\dots,N\}^h$, as well as the associated representation counts. Our results exhibit two distinct threshold scales. First, there is a \emph{global} transition at $p(N) \asymp N^{-(h-1)/h}$ governing the size of $L(A)$: below this scale collisions are rare and $L(A)$ is sparse, while above it $L(A)$ contains nearly all feasible values. We give sharp asymptotics for the size of $L(A)$ in all regimes, including inside the critical window. Second, there is a \emph{local} transition at $p(N)\asymp N^{-(h-2)/(h-1)}$ governing multiplicities: for typical values in the bulk, the number of essentially distinct representations is asymptotically Poisson below this scale, and Poisson behavior fails above it. For $h \geq 3$ these scales are separated, yielding a regime in which $L(A)$ is already globally close to full while local multiplicities remain approximately Poisson. Our framework subsumes the classical sumset and difference-set models, as well as generalized sumsets of the form $sA-dA$, as special cases. Notably, after correcting its formulation, our global theorem settles the 2009 threshold conjecture of Hegarty-Miller on the behavior of these random images.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A fundamental problem in arithmetic geometry is to determine the image of the mod $N$ Galois representation for all elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ and integers $N \geq 1$. For a given subgroup $G \le \mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})$, there is a modular curve $X_G$ whose rational points parametrize elliptic curves for which the image of the mod $N$ Galois representation is contained in $G$. If $X_G$ admits a map to an elliptic curve $E / \mathbb{Q}$ of rank $0$, then its rational points can be effectively determined, provided such a map $X_G \to E$ is known. In this article, we give a method for constructing a map $X_G \to E$ and use it to determine $X_G(\mathbb{Q})$ for more than $99\%$ of modular curves of level at most $70$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the coarse quotient $\mathfrak{t}^*//W^{\text{aff}}$ of the affine Weyl group $W^{\text{aff}}$ acting on a dual Cartan $\mathfrak{t}^*$ for some semisimple Lie algebra. Specifically, we classify sheaves on this space via a "pointwise" criterion for descent, which says that a $W^{\text{aff}}$-equivariant sheaf on $\mathfrak{t}^*$ descends to the coarse quotient if and only if the fiber at each field-valued point descends to the associated GIT quotient. We also prove the analogous pointwise criterion for descent for an arbitrary finite group acting on a vector space. Using this, we show that an equivariant sheaf for the action of a finite pseudo-reflection group descends to the GIT quotient if and only if it descends to the associated GIT quotient for every pseudo-reflection, generalizing a recent result of Lonergan.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This work is devoted to the study of representations of finite subgroups of the group of units of quaternion division algebras over a global or local field arising from the inclusion via extension of scalars splitting the algebra. Following a question by Serre, we study the set $\mathrm{IF}$ of conjugacy classes of integral representations that are conjugates of the given representation over the field. The set $\mathrm{IF}$ is often called the set of integral forms in the literature. In previous works we have seen that, for a given representation, the set $\mathrm{IF}$ can be indexed by the vertex set of a suitable subgraph of the Bruhat-Tits tree for the special linear group. In this work, we describe a construction that allows the simultaneous study of the set $\mathrm{IF}$ over different splitting fields. For this, we devise and use a theory of twisted Galois form of Bruhat-Tits trees. With this tool, we explicitly compute, in most cases, the cardinality of $\mathrm{IF}$ for the representation of the classical quaternion group of order $8$ studied by Serre, Feit and others, as much as for other similar groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a framework for describing vector bundles on $μ_n$-gerbes over curves and illustrate the construction through two detailed examples. Using the interpretation of Brauer classes as obstructions to descending determinantal line bundles from the algebraic closure, together with a geometric analysis of the moduli space of twisted sheaves, we prove that for genus $2$ curves there exist Brauer classes over the base field whose period equals their index. Over $C_1$-fields, we further show that every $2$-torsion class in the Brauer group of a genus $2$ curve satisfies the period-index problem. As an application, we construct higher-dimensional varieties obtained as fibre products of genus $2$ curves over $C_1$-fields whose $2$-torsion algebraic Brauer classes also satisfy the period-index problem, providing new evidence toward the period-index conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work we study quantitative existence results for genus-$2$ curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ whose Jacobians have Mordell-Weil rank at least $1$ or $2$, ordering the curves by the naive height of their integral Weierstrass models. We use geometric techniques to show that asymptotically the Jacobians of almost all integral models with two rational points at infinity have rank $r \geq 1$. Since there are $\asymp X^{\frac{13}{2}}$ such models among the $X^7$ curves $y^2=f(x)$ of height $\leq X$, this yields a lower bound of logarithmic density $13/14$ for the subset of rank $r \geq 1$. We further present a large explicit subfamily where Jacobians have ranks $r \geq 2$, yielding an unconditional logarithmic density of at least $5/7$. Independently, we give a construction of genus-$2$ curves with split Jacobian and rank $2$, producing a subfamily of logarithmic density at least $ 2/21$. Finally, we analyze quadratic and biquadratic twist families in the split-Jacobian setting, obtaining a positive proportion of rank-$2$ twists. These results have implications for Regev's quantum algorithm in hyperelliptic curve cryptography.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The visibility of lattice points from the origin along a polynomial family of curves constitutes a significant generalization of visibility along straight lines. Following the classical notion, where the density equals 1/2, and its generalization to monomial curves of the form y = a x^b, where the density equals 1/(b+1), we study a family of polynomial curves defined by y = q(a_n x^n + ... + a_1 x), where q is a positive rational number. We introduce a new criterion based on a polynomial greatest common divisor condition that provides a lower bound on the number of visible lattice points in N^2. Conversely, we derive conditions under which a given lattice point becomes the next visible point along such a polynomial curve. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we also obtain an exact double-sum formula for the number of pairs (a, b) less than or equal to N that are visible with respect to this polynomial family. Finally, we extend the framework to related problems and pose several open questions concerning gap distributions and quantitative bounds for non-visible points. This work provides a broader theoretical foundation for lattice point visibility beyond linear and monomial settings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Generalizing the work of Atkin and Kaneko-Zagier in the elliptic case, we describe the non-ordinary locus of a genus-zero non-compact curve $Y$ in a Hilbert modular variety in terms of the zeros of generalized Atkin's orthogonal polynomials. The argument relies on the recent construction of lifts of partial Hasse invariants for $Y$. We further describe these orthogonal polynomials as denominators of Padé approximants to the logarithmic derivatives of solutions of the Picard-Fuchs differential equations associated with $Y$. This provides a new link between Padé approximation and the geometry of the non-ordinary locus, extending a classical observation of Igusa for the Legendre family and applying, in particular, to situations where the Picard-Fuchs equations do not admit modular solutions. As applications, we determine the three-term recurrence relations for Atkin polynomials attached to triangle curves via hypergeometric identities, and compute the supersingular locus of a double cover of the Teichmüller curve $W_{17}$. In the latter case, we conjecture that the associated supersingular polynomial is self-reciprocal, implying that supersingular points occur in pairs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Skolem Problem asks to determine whether a given linear recurrence sequence (LRS) has a zero term. Showing decidability of this problem is equivalent to giving an effective proof of the Skolem-Mahler-Lech Theorem, which asserts that a non-degenerate LRS has finitely many zeros. The latter result was proven over 90 years ago via an ineffective method showing that such an LRS has only finitely many $p$-adic zeros. In this paper we consider the problem of determining whether a given LRS has a $p$-adic zero, as well as the corresponding function problem of computing exact representations of all $p$-adic zeros. We present algorithms for both problems and report on their implementation. The output of the algorithms is unconditionally correct, and termination is guaranteed subject to the $p$-adic Schanuel Conjecture (a standard number-theoretic hypothesis concerning the $p$-adic exponential function). While these algorithms do not solve the Skolem Problem, they can be exploited to find natural-number and rational zeros under additional hypotheses. To illustrate this, we apply our results to show decidability of the Simultaneous Skolem Problem (determine whether two coprime linear recurrences have a common natural-number zero), again subject to the $p$-adic Schanuel Conjecture.</p></details>

We prove that this module is always reflexive under some reasonable restrictions on the representation of the underlying Coxeter group. However, unlike the case where $\underline{t}$ and $\underline{t}'$ contain only simple reflections, this module does not need any longer to be free. We provide a series of counterexamples already for the symmetric groups $S_n$, where $n\ge4$. The projective dimension of the modules dual to them is $n-3$ and thus serves to measure the deviation from the free modules. When placed within a geometric framework, these examples show how to find fibers of points fixed by the compact torus in the Bott-Samelson resolutions (as in the original definition by Raoul Bott and Hans Samelson) with non-vanishing odd cohomology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define two notions. The first one is a $rank\ compression\ system$ $ξ$ for a finite poset $\mathbf{P}$ that assigns each interval subposet $I$ to an order-preserving map $ξ_I \colon I^ξ \to \mathbf{P}$ satisfying some conditions, where $I^ξ$ is a connected finite poset. An example is given by the $total$ compression system that assigns each $I$ to the inclusion of $I$ into $\mathbf{P}$. The second one is an $I$-$rank$ of a persistence module $M$ under $ξ$, the family of which is called the $interval\ rank\ invariant$ of $M$ under $ξ$. A compression system $ξ$ makes it possible to define the $interval\ replacement$ (also called the interval-decomposable approximation) not only for 2D persistence modules but also for any persistence modules over any finite poset. We will show that the forming of the interval replacement preserves the interval rank invariant, which is a stronger property than the preservation of the usual rank invariant. Moreover, to know what is preserved by the replacement explicitly, we will give a formula of the $I$-rank of $M$ under $ξ$ in terms of the structure linear maps of $M$ for any compression system $ξ$. The formula leads us to a concept of essential cover, which gives us a sufficient condition for the $I$-rank of $M$ under $ξ$ to coincide with that under another compression system $ζ$. This is applied to the case where $ξ= \mathrm{tot}$, the value of $I$-rank under which is equal to the generalized rank invariant introduced by Kim--Mémoli, to give an alternative proof of the Dey--Kim--Mémoli theorem computing the generalized rank invariant by using a zigzag path.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The depth of a subgroup $H$ of a finite group $G$ is a positive integer defined with respect to the inclusion of the corresponding complex group algebras $\mathbb{C}H \subseteq \mathbb{C}G$. This notion was originally introduced by Boltje, Danz and Külshammer in 2011, and it has been the subject of numerous papers in recent years. In this paper, we study the depth of core-free subgroups, which allows us to apply powerful computational and probabilistic techniques that were originally designed for studying bases for permutation groups. We use these methods to prove a wide range of new results on the depth of subgroups of almost simple groups, significantly extending the scope of earlier work in this direction. For example, we establish best possible bounds on the depth of irreducible subgroups of classical groups and primitive subgroups of symmetric groups. And with the exception of a handful of open cases involving the Baby Monster, we calculate the exact depth of every subgroup of every almost simple sporadic group. We also present a number of open problems and conjectures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime number, $K$ a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $n$ an integer $\geq 2$. We completely and explicitly describe the global sections $Ω^\bullet$ of the de Rham complex of the Drinfeld space over $K$ in dimension $n-1$ as a complex of (duals of) locally $K$-analytic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$. Using this description, we construct an explicit section in the derived category of (duals of) finite length admissible locally $K$-analytic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ to the canonical morphism of complexes $Ω^\bullet \twoheadrightarrow H^{n-1}(Ω^\bullet)[-(n-1)]$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Luc Ramsès Talla Waffo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the Mellin transforms of \(1/\mathrm{arctanh} x\) and \(1/(\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\,\mathrm{arctanh} x)\), viewed as compactly supported functions on \((0,1)\). These transforms are closely connected with conjectures on the arithmetic nature of the ratios \(ζ(2n+1)/π^{2n+1}\) and \(β(2n)/π^{2n}\). While their values at odd integers were previously studied, the evaluation at even integers leads to classes of improper integrals that cannot be handled by parity arguments. Using contour integration techniques, we derive explicit closed-form expressions involving derivatives of the Riemann zeta and Dirichlet beta functions, thereby extending earlier results and providing new analytic tools for the study of related hyperbolic integrals.</p></details>
