 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ian Martin, Alexander Tsymbaliuk &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** v1: 72pp, comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We apply the general construction of a twist of bigraded Hopf algebras by skew bicharacters to obtain two-parameter quantum groups in the Drinfeld-Jimbo, new Drinfeld (for affine types), and FRT (for both finite and affine) presentations from their standard one-parameter versions. This yields new elementary proofs of the fundamental results on two-parameter quantum groups that appeared in the literature over the last two decades, and also leads to natural generalizations in the super and multiparameter cases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2016, the first-named author introduced a formulation of the Alternative Hypothesis that assumes that consecutive zeros of the Riemann zeta-function are spaced at multiples of half of the average spacing, but does not assume that the zeros are simple. In this paper, we assume the Riemann Hypothesis and a similar formulation of the Alternative Hypothesis, and for each integer $k$ we obtain constraints on the density of pairs of zeros whose normalized differences are at $k/2$ times the average spacing. These constraints, in turn, restrict the density of (possible) multiple zeros. We also formulate a stronger version of the Alternative Hypothesis and show that it implies the Essential Simplicity Hypothesis.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gergely Harcos, Jesse Thorner &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\pi$ and $\pi'$ be cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}(n)$ and $\mathrm{GL}(n')$ with unitary central characters. We establish a new zero-free region for all $\mathrm{GL}(1)$-twists of the Rankin-Selberg $L$-function $L(s,\pi\times\pi')$, generalizing Tatuzawa's refinement of Siegel's work on Dirichlet $L$-functions. A crucial component of our proof is a new standard zero-free region for any twist of $L(s,\pi\times\widetilde{\pi})$ by an idele class character $\chi$ apart from a possible single exceptional zero (necessarily real and simple) that can occur only when $\pi\otimes\chi^2=\pi$. This extends earlier work of Humphries and Thorner.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ankita Parashar, Shiv Prakash Patel &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 25 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{o}_l$ be a finite principal ideal local ring of length $l$. The degenerate Whittaker space associated with a representation of ${\rm GL}_{2n}(\mathfrak{o}_l)$ is a representation of ${\rm GL}_n(\mathfrak{o}_l)$. For strongly cuspidal representations of ${\rm GL}_{2n}(\mathfrak{o}_l)$ the structure of degenerate Whittaker space is described by Prasad's conjecture, which has been proven for ${\rm GL}_4(\mathfrak{o}_2)$. In this paper, we describe the degenerate Whittaker space for certain induced representations of ${\rm GL}_4(\mathfrak{o}_2)$, specifically those induced from subgroups analogous to the maximal parabolic subgroups of ${\rm GL}_4(\mathbb{F}_q)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 14 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study second-order modular differential equations whose solutions transform equivariantly under the modular group. In the reducible case, we construct all such solutions using an explicit ansatz involving Eisenstein series and the $J$-invariant, reducing the problem to an algebraic system. We show that the roots of this system are captured by orthogonal polynomials satisfying a Fuchsian differential equation. Their recurrence, norms, and weight function are derived, completing the classification of equivariant solutions in this setting.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** S. K. Rithvik &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present an explicit bijection between finite-decimal real numbers and natural numbers ($\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, ...\}$) using a systematic 4-tuple parametrization with closed-form mathematical formulas for enumeration. Our enumeration system provides complete indexing of all real numbers with terminating decimal representations through the parametrization $(\text{sign}, N_1, N_2, N_3)$. Both forward and inverse mappings execute in O(1) constant time, achieved through closed-form lexicographic positioning formulas that eliminate enumeration loops. The system uses exact decimal arithmetic throughout, ensuring perfect accuracy across all representable numbers. This bijective correspondence demonstrates that finite-decimal real numbers can be systematically enumerated and indexed with optimal constant-time computational efficiency.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 26 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For integral weights $\lambda$ and $\mu$ of a classical simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, Kostant's weight multiplicity formula gives the multiplicity of the weight $\mu$ in the irreducible representation with highest weight $\lambda$, which we denote by $m(\lambda,\mu)$. Kostant's weight multiplicity formula is an alternating sum over the Weyl group of the Lie algebra whose terms are determined via a vector partition function. The Weyl alternation set $\mathcal{A}(\lambda,\mu)$ is the set of elements of the Weyl group that contribute nontrivially to the multiplicity $m(\lambda,\mu)$. In this article, we prove that Weyl alternation sets are order ideals in the weak Bruhat order of the corresponding Weyl group. Specializing to the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_{r+1}(\mathbb{C})$, we give a complete characterization of the Weyl alternation sets $\mathcal{A}(\tilde{\alpha},\mu)$, where $\tilde{\alpha}$ is the highest root and $\mu$ is a negative root, answering a question of Harry posed in 2024. We also provide some enumerative results that pave the way for our future work, where we aim to prove Harry's conjecture that the $q$-analog of Kostant's weight multiplicity formula is $m_q(\tilde{\alpha},\mu)=q^{r+j-i+1}+q^{r+j-i}-q^{j-i+1}$ when $\mu=-(\alpha_i+\alpha_{i+1}+\cdots+\alpha_{j})$ is a negative root of $\mathfrak{sl}_{r+1}(\mathbb{C})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine the structure of the obstruction group of the Hasse norm principle for a finite separable extension $K/k$ of a global field of degree $d$, where $d$ has a square-free prime factor $p$ and a $p$-Sylow subgroup of the Galois group $G$ of the Galois closure of $K/k$ is normal in $G$. Specifically, we give a partial classification of the validity of the Hasse norm principle for $K/k$ in the case where (1) $[K:k]=p\ell$ where $p$ and $\ell$ are two distinct prime numbers; or (2) $[K:k]=4p$ where $p$ is an odd prime. The result (1) gives infinitely many new existences of finite extensions of arbitrary number fields for which the Hasse norm principle fail. Furthermore, we prove that there exist infinitely many separable extensions of square-free degree for which the exponents of the obstruction groups to the Hasse norm principle are not prime powers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $L$ be an even indefinite lattice. We show that if $L$ splits off a hyperbolic plane and a scaled hyperbolic plane, then the Kudla-Millson lift of genus $1$ associated to $L$ is injective. Our result includes as special cases all previously known injectivity results on the whole space of elliptic cusp forms available in the literature. In particular, we also consider the Funke-Millson twist of the lift. Further, we provide geometric applications on locally symmetric spaces of orthogonal type.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X$ be a smooth irreducible quasi-projective algebraic variety over a number field $K$. Suppose $X$ is equipped with a $p$-adic \'{e}tale local system compatible with an admissible graded-polarized variation of mixed Hodge structures on the complex analytification of $X_{\mathbb{C}}$. We prove that the $S$-integral points in $X$ are covered by subpolynomially many geometrically irreducible $K$-subvarieties, each lying in a fiber of the mixed period mapping arising from the variation of mixed Hodge structures. This is based on recent works by Brunebarbe-Maculan and Ellenberg-Lawrence-Venkatesh. As an application, we prove that there are subpolynomially many $S$-integral Laurent polynomials with fixed reflexive Newton polyhedron $\Delta$ and fixed non-zero principal $\Delta$-determinant. Our results answer a question asked by Ellenberg-Lawrence-Venkatesh.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Final version, to appear in Algebra & Number Theory

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct local models for wildly ramified unitary similitude groups of odd dimension $n\geq 3$ with special parahoric level structure and signature $(n-1,1)$. We first give a lattice-theoretic description for parahoric subgroups using Bruhat-Tits theory in residue characteristic two, and apply them to define local models following the lead of Rapoport-Zink and Pappas-Rapoport. In our case, there are two conjugacy classes of special parahoric subgroups. We show that the local models are smooth for the one class and normal, Cohen-Macaulay for the other class. We also prove that they represent the v-sheaf local models of Scholze-Weinstein. Under some additional assumptions, we obtain an explicit moduli interpretation of the local models.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cases of Shimura varieties where the special fibre of a Rapoport-Zink space is simply the union of classical Deligne-Lusztig varieties are known as fully Hodge-Newton decomposable ones, and have been studied with great interest in the past. In recent times, the focus has shifted to identify tractable cases beyond the fully Hodge-Newton decomposable ones, and several instances have been identified where only products of classical Deligne-Lusztig varities with simpler spaces occur. In our paper, we provide a uniform framework to capture these phenomena. By studying liftings from the affine flag variety to the loop group and combining them with the Deligne-Lusztig reduction method, our main result is a powerful criterion to show that an affine Deligne-Lusztig variety is the product of a classical Deligne-Lusztig variety with affine spaces and pointed affine spaces. We introduce the class of elements that we call having geometric Coxeter type, strictly including previously studied notions such as positive Coxeter type or finite Coxeter type. These elements of geometric Coxeter type satisfy the conditions for our main result and also a condition on the Newton stratification introduced by Mili\'cevi\'c-Viehmann.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jun Hu, Lei Shi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Simplified the main argument in Section 5

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There are two longstanding conjectures on the centers of the cyclotomic Hecke algebra $\mathscr{H}_{n,K}^\Lambda$ of type $G(r,1,n)$ which assert that: 1) the dimension of the center $Z(\mathscr{H}_{n,K}^\Lambda)$ is independent of the characteristic of the ground field $K$, its Hecke parameter and cyclotomic parameters; 2) the center $Z(\mathscr{H}_{n,K}^\Lambda)$ of $\mathscr{H}_{n,K}^\Lambda$ is the set of symmetric polynomials in its Jucys-Murphy operators. In this paper we prove these two conjectures affirmatively. At the same time we show that the center conjecture holds for the cyclotomic KLR algebras $\mathscr{R}_{\alpha,K}^\Lambda$ associated to the cyclic quiver $A_{e-1}^{(1)}$ (for $e>1$) and the linear quiver $A_{\infty}$ (for $e=0$) when the ground field $K$ has characteristic $p$ which satisfies either $p=0$, or $p>0=e$, or $p=e>1$, or $p>0$, $e>1$ and $p$ is coprime to $e$. As applications, we show that the cohomology of the Nakajima quiver variety $\mathfrak{M}(\Lambda,\alpha)$ with coefficient in $K$ is isomorphic to the center of $\mathscr{R}_{\alpha,K}^\Lambda$ in the affine type $A$ case when ${\rm{char}} K=0$; we also verify Chavli-Pfeiffer's conjecture on the polynomial coefficient $g_{w,C}$ for the complex reflection group of type $G(r,1,n)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map encodes the voltage-to-current measurements under the influence of a magnetic field. In the case of surfaces, we provide precise spectral asymptotics expansion (up to arbitrary polynomial power) for the eigenvalues of this map. Moreover, we consider the inverse spectral problem and from the expansion we show that the spectrum of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, in favourable situations, uniquely determines the number and the length of boundary components, the parallel transport and the magnetic flux along boundary components. In general, we show that the situation complicates compared to the case when there is no magnetic field. For instance, there are plenty of examples where the expansion does $\textit{not}$ detect the number of boundary components, and this phenomenon is thoroughly studied in the paper.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 92 pages, 17 figures. v2: corrected misclassified shifted Charlier specialization; added results on Stieltjes moment sequences; reorganized the paper into three parts for clearer exposition

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study positivity and probabilistic properties arising from the Young--Fibonacci lattice $\mathbb{YF}$, a 1-differential poset on binary (Fibonacci) words of 1's and 2's, graded by digit sum. Building on Okada's theory of clone Schur functions (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 346 (1994), 549--568), we define clone coherent measures on $\mathbb{YF}$ that generate random Fibonacci words of increasing length; unlike for the Young lattice (powered by the classical Schur functions), clone coherent measures are generally not extremal on $\mathbb{YF}$. Our first main result is a complete characterization of Fibonacci positive specializations -- parameter sequences which yield positive clone Schur functions on $\mathbb{YF}$. Second, we connect Fibonacci positivity with: (i) total positivity of tridiagonal matrices; (ii) Stieltjes moment sequences; (iii) the combinatorics of set partitions; and (iv) families of univariate orthogonal polynomials from the (q-)Askey scheme. We further link moment sequences of orthogonal polynomials to combinatorial structures on Fibonacci words, a connection that may be of independent interest. Third, we analyze scaling limits of the induced random words, obtaining stick-breaking-type limits (linked to GEM laws), new dependent stick-breaking limits, and limits supported on the discrete part of the Martin boundary of $\mathbb{YF}$. These results significantly extend the asymptotics of the Plancherel measure on $\mathbb{YF}$ proved by Gnedin--Kerov (Math. Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc. 129 (2000), 433--446). Finally, we prove Cauchy-type identities for clone Schur functions with quadridiagonal-determinant right-hand side (in contrast to the product form for classical Schur functions), and construct models of random permutations and involutions from Fibonacci-positive specializations together with a Robinson--Schensted correspondence adapted to $\mathbb{YF}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define super-Cayley graphs over a finite abelian group $G$. Using the theory of supercharacters on $G$, we explain how their spectra can be realized as a super-Fourier transform of a superclass characteristic function. Consequently, we show that a super-Cayley graph is determined by its spectrum once an indexing on the underlying group $G$ is fixed. This generalizes a theorem by Sander-Sander, which investigates the case where $G$ is a cyclic group. We then use our theory to define and study the concept of a $U$-unitary Cayley graph over a finite commutative ring $R$, where $U$ is a subgroup of the unit group of $R$. Furthermore, when the underlying ring is a Frobenius ring, we show that there is a natural supercharacter theory associated with $U$. By applying the general theory of super-Cayley graphs developed in the first part, we explore various spectral properties of these $U$-unitary Cayley graphs, including their rationality and connections to various arithmetical sums.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider representations of quivers taking values in monads or comonads over a Grothendieck category $\mathcal C$. We treat these as scheme like objects whose ``structure sheaf'' consists of monads or comonads. By using systems of adjoint functors between Eilenberg-Moore categories, we obtain a categorical framework of modules over monad quivers, and of comodules over comonad quivers. Our main objective is to give conditions for these to be Grothendieck categories, which play the role of noncommutative spaces. As with usual ringed spaces, we have to study two kinds of module categories over a monad quiver. The first behaves like a sheaf of modules over a ringed space. The second consists of modules that are cartesian, which resemble quasi-coherent sheaves. We also obtain an extension of the classical quasi-coherator construction to modules over a monad quiver with values in Eilenberg-Moore categories. We establish similar results for comodules over a comonad quiver. One of our key steps is finding a modulus like bound for an endofunctor $U:\mathcal C\longrightarrow \mathcal C$ in terms of $\kappa(G)$, where $G$ is a generator for $\mathcal C$ and $\kappa(G)$ is a cardinal such that $G$ is $\kappa(G)$-presentable. Another feature of our paper is that we study modules over a monad quiver in two different orientations, which we refer to as ``cis-modules'' and ``trans-modules.'' We conclude with rational pairings of a monad quiver with a comonad quiver, which relate comodules over a comonad quiver to coreflective subcategories of modules over monad quivers.</p></details>

In particular, we obtain the first cases of this conjecture for non-essentially-self-dual RACARs of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{A})$. Our proof has two main parts. In Part 1, we use $p$-arithmetic cohomology to prove an exceptional zero formula using Gehrmann's automorphic $\mathcal{L}$-invariant. In Part 2 we prove the equality of automorphic and Fontaine--Mazur $\mathcal{L}$-invariants. As one of the key ingredients for this, we establish local-global compatibility at $\ell = p$ for Galois representations attached to $p$-ordinary torsion classes for $\mathrm{GL}_n$, confirming a conjecture of Hansen in this setting. We prove this for all $n$ following the strategy in the "10-author paper," and use the $n=3$ case to deduce the desired equality of $\mathcal{L}$-invariants.</p></details>

If $K$ has a real embedding then a positive answer was established in previous work. Here we obtain a positive answer if $\textrm{Tor}\bigl(K^{\times}\bigr) \not= \{\pm 1\}$, and so $K$ has only complex embeddings. We also show that if the answer is negative, then $K$ is totally complex, $\textrm{Tor}\bigl(K^{\times}\bigr) = \{\pm 1\}$, and $K$ is a Galois extension of its maximal totally real subfield. Further, we show that if $\mu \in O_K$ is not totally real, then there exists $\alpha$ in $O_K$ with $K = \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ and $H(\alpha) \le H(\mu)\thinspace c_K$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer $x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$ for $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps $x\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In particular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$. This seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the conjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any correspondence between polynomials and positive integers. In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend their domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that correspond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power series. We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\colon F_2[[q]]\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$ otherwise, where $A,B\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some of these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive integers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that $T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the orbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two fixed points. Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these conjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by replacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic integer. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could settle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for both $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.</p></details>

We prove that as $n \to \infty$, this flag converges universally, for any nondegenerate entry distribution, to the Cohen-Lenstra type measure which weights each flag inversely proportional to the size of its automorphism group. As a corollary, we prove universality of certain formulas for the limiting conditional distribution of $\mathrm{cok}(M_1M_2)$ given $\mathrm{cok}(M_1),\mathrm{cok}(M_2)$ in terms of Hall-Littlewood structure constants, which were previously obtained only for Haar matrices over $\mathbb{Z}_p$.

We show that if $B$ is prosaic and simple, then there is an isogenous abelian variety $A$ for which End $A$ is the ring of integers $\mathfrak{o}$ in a number field $L$. The field $L$ is a totally real or CM field and all primes of $\mathfrak{o}$ over $2$ have residue degree $1$. For $p \equiv 1$ (mod 8), let $M_u$ be the maximal 2-primary unramified abelian extension of $K = {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{-p})$ and let $h_2 = [M_u:K]$. We construct an indecomposable group scheme $\Xi_p$ over ${\mathbb Z}[\frac{1}{p}]$ of exponent 2 with field of points $M_u$. Assume that $A$ is prosaic, with bad reduction at only one prime $p$. Then $p \equiv 1$ (mod 8) and $A$ is totally toroidal at $p$. We prove that if End $A={\mathbb Z}$, then there is a ${\mathbb Q}$-isogenous abelian variety $B$ such that $B[2]$ is a subquotient of $\Xi_p$. We thereby show that $2g+2 \le h_2$ and $p$ has the form $a^2+16b^2$, with $a+4b \equiv \pm 1$ (mod 8). Moreover, if $2g + 4 \le h_2$, then $p$ has the form $a^2+64b^2$, with $a \equiv \pm 1$ (mod 8).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>$\widehat{Z}$ invariants, rigorously defined for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds, are expected--on physical grounds--to exist for every closed, oriented 3-manifold. Several prescriptions have been proposed to extend their definition to generic plumbings by reversing the orientation of a negative definite plumbing, thus turning it into a positive definite one. Two existing proposals are relevant for this paper: (i) the regularized $+1/r$-surgery conjecture combined with the false-mock modular conjecture, and (ii) a construction based on resurgence and a false theta function duality. In this note, we compare these proposals on the class of Brieskorn homology spheres $\Sigma\left(s,t,rst\pm1\right)$ and find that they are incompatible in general. Our diagnostic is the effective central charge, $c_{\text{eff}}$, which governs the asymptotic growth of coefficients of $\widehat{Z}$. First, we prove that the upper bound on $c_{\text{eff}}$ from prescription (i) is governed by the Ramanujan theta function, which regularizes the surgery formula. Second, we develop numerical and modular tools that deliver the lower bounds as well as exact values via mixed mock-modular analysis. Complementing this, we also study $c_{\text{eff}}$ for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds which allow for a better comparison of pairs of 3-manifolds related by orientation reversal. As a result, we find that for some Brieskorn spheres the surgery and false-mock prescriptions violate the expected relation between $c_{\text{eff}}$, Chern-Simons invariants and non-abelian flat connections. These findings underscore $\widehat{Z}$ as a sensitive probe of the "positive side" of $\widehat{Z}$-theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\chi$ be an idele class character over a number field $F$, and let $\pi,\pi'$ be any two cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{A}_F)$. We prove that the Rankin-Selberg $L$-function $L(s,\mathrm{Sym}^2(\pi)\times(\mathrm{Sym}^2 (\pi')\otimes\chi))$ has a "standard" zero-free region with no exceptional Landau-Siegel zero except possibly when it is divisible by the $L$-function of a real idele class character. In particular, no such zero exists if $\pi$ is non-dihedral and $\pi'$ is not a twist of $\pi$. Until now, this was only known when $\pi=\pi'$, $\pi$ is self-dual, and $\chi$ is trivial.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using Galois representations, we analyze fields of definition of cyclic isogenies on elliptic curves to prove the following uniformity result: for any number field $F$ which has no rational CM, under GRH there exists an effectively computable constant $B:=B(F)\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that for any finite extension $L/F$ whose degree $[L:F]$ is coprime to $B$, one has for all elliptic curves $E_{/F}$ that any $L$-rational isogeny on $E$ is $F$-rational. For any number field $F$, under GRH we also prove results for the mod-$\ell$ Galois representations of non-CM elliptic curves with an $F$-rational isogeny of uniformly large prime degree $\ell$.</p></details>

We provide an analogous cohomological interpretation for the representations generated by idempotents in the peak algebra, called the peak representations.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We exhibit new examples of regions of $M\setminus L$ where $M$ and $L$ denote the Markov and Lagrange spectra, respectively. These regions have a different nature from all known regions studied so far: they contain \emph{intruder sets} associated with distinct combinatorics that trespass the region where self-replication holds. Our construction follows the usual self-replication method but replaces the standard local uniqueness condition with a more flexible and weaker property. These examples emerged from a large-scale computational search for regions of $M\setminus L$, which indicates that many such regions with intruder sets exist. We conclude with some open problems about these new regions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a point $x_0$ in a Shimura variety attached to a Shimura datum of Hodge type $(G,X)$, we have an associated abelian scheme $A_0$. Fixing a non-empty finite set $\mathcal{S}$ of primes, we consider the simultaneous supersingular reduction modulo $\ell\in\mathcal{S}$ of (several copies of) $p$-adic Hecke orbits of $A_0$. We give a precise description of the image of this map. As an application, we give a more conceptual proof of Mazur's conjecture on non-torsionness of higher Heegner points on an abelian variety which is a quotient of the Jacobian of a Shimura curve. Our arguments simplify those of C.Cornut and V.Vatsal in two important aspects: (1) we do not need to assume the $p$-adic group $G^1(\mathbb{Q}_p)/Z_{G^1(\mathbb{Q}_p)}$ to be simple; (2) we do not need to consider separately the ``geometric" part and ``chaotic" part in the Hecke orbits.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We recast congruences for the partition function through the geometry of supersingular elliptic curves.

In the ramified case $\ell\in\{5,7,11\}$ (i.e. $\ell\mid(1-24n)$), a geometric "bonus valuation'' along supersingular fibers forces Ramanujan's congruences $$ p(5n+4)\equiv0\pmod5,\qquad p(7n+5)\equiv0\pmod7,\qquad p(11n+6)\equiv0\pmod{11}. $$ This phenomenon occurs because the supersingular $j$-invariants on $X_0(6)_{\mathbb{F}_\ell}$ for these primes lie over $\{0,1728\}$, allowing a certain Serre-Tate pullback to be regular at every supersingular point.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Chebotarev's density theorem asserts that the prime ideals are equidistributed among the conjugacy classes of the Galois group of any normal extension of number fields. An effective version of this theorem was first established by Lagarias and Odlyzko in 1977. In this article, we present an explicit refinement of their statement that applies to all non-rational fields, with every implicit constant expressed explicitly in terms of the field invariants. Additionally, we provide a sharper bound for extensions of sufficiently small degree. Our approach begins by proving an explicit formula for a smoothed prime ideal counting function. This relies on recent zero-free regions for Dedekind zeta functions, improved estimates on the number of low-lying zeros, and precise bounds for sums over the non-trivial zeros of the Dedekind $\zeta$-function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study rational points on the elliptic surface given by the equation: $$y^2 = x^3 + AxQ(u,v)^2 + BQ(u,v)^3,$$ where $A,B\in \mathbb{Z}$ satisfy that $4A^3-27B^2\neq 0$ and $Q(u,v)$ is a positive-definite quadratic form. We prove asymptotics for a special subset of the rational points, specifically those that are integral with respect to the singularity. This method utilizes Mordell's parameterization of integral points on quadratic twists on elliptic curves, which is based on a syzygy for invariants of binary quartic forms. Let $F(A,B)$ denote the set of binary quartic forms with invariants $-4A$ and $-4B$ under the action of $\textrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We reduce the point-counting problem to the question of determining an asymptotic formula for the correlation sums of representation numbers of binary quadratic and binary quartic forms, where the quartic forms range in $F(A,B)$. These sums are then treated using a connection to modular forms. In a stand-alone appendix, we study sums of absolute values of Hecke eigenvalues of $\textrm{GL}(2)$ representations that are tempered at all finite places. We show that these sums exhibit logarithmic savings over the trivial bound if and only if the representation is cuspidal. Further, we connect the problem of studying the sums of Hecke eigenvalues along polynomial values to the base change problem for $\textrm{GL}(2).$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the affine closure of the cotangent bundle of the parabolic base affine space for $\mathrm{GL}_n$ or $\mathrm{SL}_n$ is a Coulomb branch, which confirms a conjecture of Bourget-Dancer-Grimminger-Hanany-Zhong. In particular, we show that the algebra of functions on the cotangent bundle of the parabolic base affine space of $\mathrm{GL}_n$ or $\mathrm{SL}_n$ is finitely generated. We prove this by showing that, if we are given a map $H \to G$ of complex reductive groups and a representation of $G$ satisfying an assumption we call gluable, then the Coulomb branch for the induced representation of $H$ is obtained from the corresponding Coulomb branch for $G$ by a certain Hamiltonian reduction procedure. In particular, we show that the Coulomb branch associated to any quiver with no loops can be obtained from Coulomb branches associated to quivers with exactly two vertices using this procedure.</p></details>

In the next step, we transform this construction into an algorithm that computes the digits of a t-normal number recursively in all integer bases. Moreover, we extend our covering approach to construct and compute LIL-normal numbers whose discrepancies are of the order predicted by the law of the iterated logarithm.

This algebraic identification is deduced by relating degenerate affine Hecke algebras to the simplest example of a rational Feigin-Odesskii shuffle product.

This generalizes our previous work which requires $d=1$ and restricts Schmidt-type counting estimates to approximation functions which decay fast enough. Novel techniques include a bootstrap scheme for the associated random walks despite algebraic obstructions, and a refined treatment of Dani's correspondence.

We study the primes of $K$ for which this index lies in a given set of positive integers $S$. In particular, we prove that under certain convergence conditions on series associated to $S$ this problem can be addressed without assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), and we provide asymptotic formulas for the corresponding prime-counting functions. Problems of this type are related to Artin's primitive root conjecture, which has been proven under the assumption of GRH (Hooley, 1967).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For every irrational real $\alpha$, let $M(\alpha) = \sup_{n\geq 1} a_n(\alpha)$ denote the largest partial quotient in its continued fraction expansion (or $\infty$, if unbounded). The $2$-adic Littlewood conjecture (2LC) can be stated as follows: There exists no irrational $\alpha$ such that $M(2^k \alpha)$ is uniformly bounded by a constant $C$ for all $k\geq 0$. In 2016, Badziahin proved (considering a different formulation of 2LC) that if a counterexample exists, then the bound $C$ is at least $8$. We improve this bound to $15$. Then we focus on a ``B-variant'' of 2LC, where we replace $M(\alpha)$ by $B(\alpha) = \limsup_{n\to \infty} a_n(\alpha)$. In this setting, we prove that if $B(2^k \alpha) \leq C$ for all $k\geq 0$, then $C \geq 5$. For the proof we use Hurwitz's algorithm for multiplication of continued fractions by 2. Along the way, we find families of quadratic irrationals $\alpha$ with the property that for arbitrarily large $K$ there exist $\beta, 2\beta, 4 \beta, \ldots, 2^K \beta$ all equivalent to $\alpha$.</p></details>

In the case where $P$ is cubic, such an algorithm allows the construction of an RSA key of $k$ bits that can be described using about $k/3$ bits of information. We also show how to construct a solution $(n,d_1,d_2)$ with the ratio $d_1/d_2$ arbitrarily close to any given positive real number. This proves that among all solutions $(n,d_1,d_2)$ of $P(n) = d_1d_2$ the ratios $d_1/d_2$ are dense in $(0,+\infty)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a combinatorial identity relating Catalan numbers to tangent numbers arising from the study of peak algebra that was conjectured by Aliniaeifard and Li. This identity leads to the discovery of the intriguing identity $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}{2n\choose 2k+1}2^{2n-2k}(-1)^{k}E_{2k+1}=2^{2n+1}, $$ where $E_{2k+1}$ denote the tangent numbers. Interestingly, the latter identity can be applied to prove that $(n + 1)E_{2n+1}$ is divisible by $2^{2n}$ and the quotient is an odd number, a fact whose traditional proofs require significant calculations. Moreover, we find a natural $q$-analog of the latter identity with a combinatorial proof. This $q$-identity can be applied to prove Foata's divisibility property of the $q$-tangent numbers, which responds to a problem raised by Sch\"utzenberger.</p></details>

As an application, we obtain a class of weight $\mathfrak{g}$-modules from those non-weight $\mathfrak{g}$-modules by weighting functor.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a zero-relation algebra over a field $\mathcal K$, Crawley-Boevey introduced the concept of a tree module and provided a combinatorial description of a basis for the space of homomorphisms between two tree modules--the basis elements are called graph maps. The indecomposability of tree modules is essentially due to Gabriel. We relax a condition in the definition of a tree module to define generalised tree modules and when $\mathrm{char}(\mathcal K)\neq2$, under a certain condition, provide a combinatorial description of a finite generating set for the space of homomorphisms between two such modules--we call the generators generalised graph maps. As an application, we provide a sufficient condition for the (in)decomposability of certain generalised tree modules. We also show that all indecomposable modules over a Dynkin quiver of type $\mathbf D$ are isomorphic to generalised tree modules--this result also follows from a theorem of Ringel which states that all exceptional modules over the path algebra $\mathcal KQ$ of a finite quiver $Q$ are generalised tree modules.</p></details>
