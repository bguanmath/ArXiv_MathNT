<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We improve 1987 estimates of Patterson for sums of quartic Gauss sums over primes. Our Type-I and Type-II estimates feature new ideas, including use of the quadratic large sieve over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$, and Suzuki's evaluation of the Fourier-Whittaker coefficients of quartic theta functions at squares. We also conjecture asymptotics for certain moments of quartic Gauss sums over primes.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yuly Billig, Kathlyn Dykes &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an affine algebraic variety, we introduce algebraic Gelfand-Fuks cohomology of polynomial vector fields with coefficients in differentiable $AV$-modules. Its complex is given by cochains that are differential operators in the sense of Grothendieck. Using the jets of vector fields, we compute this cohomology for varieties with uniformizing parameters. We prove that in this case, Gelfand-Fuks cohomology with coefficients in a tensor module decomposes as a tensor product of the de Rham cohomology of the variety and the cohomology of the Lie algebra of vector fields on affine space, vanishing at the origin. We explicitly compute this cohomology for affine space, the torus, and Krichever-Novikov algebras.</p></details>

> **Comment:** In this revised version, we fixed a technical error related to completed tensor products

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a quasi-coherent sheaf of associative algebras which controls a category of $AV$-modules over a smooth quasi-projective variety. We establish a local structure theorem, proving that in étale charts these associative algebras decompose into a tensor product of the algebra of differential operators and the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of power series vector fields vanishing at the origin.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Mahesh Kumar Ram, Prem Prakash Pandey, Nimish Kumar Mahapatra &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Comments and suggestions are most welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There are several recent works where authors have shown that number fields $K$ with `sufficiently many' units and cyclic class group contain a Euclidean ideal class provided the Hilbert class field $H(K)$ is absolutely abelian. In this article, we explore the latter hypothesis: how often a number field $K$ has absolutely abelian Hilbert class field? For a number field $K$ to have absolutely abelian Hilbert class field, we obtain several criteria in terms of class number of $K$, Pólya group of $K$, and genus number of $K$. We also show that for such number fields the $\ell-$torsion conjecture is true. Along with these, the article also reports some results on a theme to study class groups, developed by the authors, where primes of higher degree are used to study class groups.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jérémy Champagne, Zhenchao Ge, Thái Hoàng Lê, Yu-Ru Liu, Trevor D. Wooley &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** E. Ackelsberg and V. Bergelson have advised that the 'implied infelicity' noted in section 1 of our paper is remedied by correcting the conclusion of [2, Theorem 0.3] concerning well-distribution of g from an "if and only if" to an "if" statement; the ensuing conclusions claimed by Ackelsberg then follow without impairment. We intend to revise our paper to account for this forthcoming correction

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb F_q$ be the finite field of $q$ elements having characteristic $p$, and denote by $\mathbb K_\infty=\mathbb F_q((1/t))$ the field of formal Laurent series in $1/t$. We consider the equidistribution in $\mathbb T=\mathbb K_\infty/\mathbb F_q[t]$ of the values of polynomials $f(u)\in \mathbb K_\infty [u]$ as $u$ varies over $\mathbb F_q[t]$. Let $\mathcal K$ be a finite set of positive integers, and suppose that $α_r\in \mathbb K_\infty$ for $r\in \mathcal K\cup \{0\}$. We show that the polynomial $\sum_{r\in \mathcal K\cup\{0\}}α_ru^r$ is equidistributed in $\mathbb T$ whenever $α_k$ is irrational for some $k\in \mathcal K$ satisfying $p\nmid k$, and also $p^vk\not\in \mathcal K$ for any positive integer $v$. This conclusion resolves in full a conjecture made jointly by the third, fourth and fifth authors.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tony Feng &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Prior work of Feng--Yun--Zhang established a (Higher) Arithmetic Hirzebruch Proportionality Principle, expressing the arithmetic volumes of moduli stacks of shtukas in terms of differential operators applied to $L$-functions. This formula involves certain "eigenweights" which were calculated in simple cases by Feng--Yun--Zhang, but not in general. We document work of a (custom) AI Agent built upon Gemini Deep Think, which employs tools from algebraic combinatorics to connect these eigenweights to the representation theory of symmetric groups, and then determines them for all classical groups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 13 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, 3 algorithms, typos corrected, statement of Theorem 1.5 edited

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish that every set of $k=10$ natural numbers determines at least $30$ distinct pairwise sums or at least $30$ distinct pairwise products, as well as the analogous result for $k=11$ and at least $34$ sums/products, with sharpness exhibited by $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18\}$ and $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24\}$, respectively. This extends previous work of the fifth author with Clevenger, Havard, Heard, Lott, and Wilson, which established the corresponding thresholds for $k\leq 9$. Included is a classification result for sets of $10$ real numbers (resp. positive real numbers) determining at most $29$ pairwise sums (resp. pairwise products) that do not contain $8$ elements of any single arithmetic progression (resp. geometric progression), as well as some observations controlling additive quadruples in small subsets of two-dimensional generalized geometric progressions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Fulin Chen, Binyong Sun, Yixiang Weng &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Gelfand-Kazhdan criterion is a fundamental tool for studying multiplicity-one properties of local periods of representations. However, it does not apply to many cases arising in the relative Langlands program. Generalizing the usual Gelfand-Kazhdan criterion, we formulate and prove a vector-valued Gelfand-Kazhdan criterion that fits into the general framework of the relative Langlands program. As an illustration of its effectiveness, we establish the multiplicity-one property for the local Asai Rankin-Selberg periods.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages, French; minor corrections and two annexes added in this second version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The aim of this article is to give a complete proof of results of Harish-Chandra linking the irreducibility of parabolic induction of a supercuspidal representation of a p-adic group to the analytic behavior of the mu-function of Harish-Chandra and to show that the proof remains valid in the case of a central extension.M</p></details>

> **Comment:** Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Powers of a polynomial $\mathrm{GL}$-representation are topologically Noetherian under the action of $\mathrm{Sym} \times \mathrm{GL}$. We show that this result extends to powers of algebraic representations of the orthogonal and the symplectic groups. This work is a natural follow-up to arXiv:2212.05790 and to arXiv:1708.06420.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jean-François Burnol &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present series converging to the Riemann zeta function in its half-plane of convergence, and possessing remainders whose sizes decrease geometrically. They are easy to implement numerically, using only polynomial and power functions, and are efficient for obtaining dozens or hundreds of digits (when the imaginary part is not too large). They may prove less suited to very high precision (tens of thousands of digits), due to a linear cost for each new term. One can express the coefficients as linear combinations of Bernoulli numbers, but this is not advantageous numerically. The method is a development of tools introduced by the author for the evaluation of harmonic series with restricted digits in a given radix.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show how various constructions of $\mathbb{Z}$-graded Lie superalgebras are related to each other. These Lie superalgebras have a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ as the subalgebra at degree 0, an odd $\mathfrak{g}$-module V as the subspace at degree 1, and an embedding tensor as an element at degree -1. This is a linear map from V to $\mathfrak{g}$ satisfying a quadratic constraint, which equips V with the structure of a Leibniz algebra.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18599v3'>2601.18599</a>\]&nbsp; **Asymptotics of the d'Arcais Numbers at Small $k$**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Shannon Starr &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 15 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The d'Arcais numbers are the triangular array $\{A(2,n,k)\, :\, n=0,1,\dots,\, k=0,\dots,n\}$, such that $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{n} A(2,n,k) x^k z^n/n! = ((z;z)_{\infty})^{-x}$. The infinite $q$-Pochhammer symbol is $(q;q)_{\infty} = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1-q^n)$. Holding $k$ fixed and considering large $n$, we note that the ratio $k! A(2,n,k)/n!$ is asymptotic to $C(k) σ_{2k-1}(n)/n^k$ where the divisor sum function is $σ_p(n) = \sum_{d|n} d^p$ and $C(k) = (ζ(2))^k/(Γ(k) ζ(2k))$. This is a slightly generalized version of one of Ramanujan's formulas from his paper, ``On Certain Arithmetical Functions," and it is an immediate consequence of the more recent article of Oliver, Shreshta and Thorne. Heim and Neuhauser made a conjecture, that $A(2,n,k)/A(2,n,k-1)$ is greater than or equal to $A(2,n,k+1)/A(2,n,k)$, for $k=2,3,\dots$ and all $n$. The conjecture is false for $k=2$, and it is true for $k=3,4,\dots$ when $n$ is sufficiently large. We consider the Hardy-Ramanujan circle method as a heuristic step.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Patrick Brosnan, Jaehyun Hong, Donggun Lee &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 40 pages. Revised version, including a new result on Weyl group symmetry of weight multiplicities (Corollary 1.12)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Lusztig varieties are subvarieties in flag manifolds $G/B$ associated to an element $w$ in the Weyl group $W$ and an element $x$ in $G$, introduced in Lusztig's papers on character sheaves. We study the geometry of these varieties when $x$ is regular semisimple. In the first part, we establish that they are normal, Cohen-Macaulay, of pure expected dimension and have rational singularities. We then show that the cohomology of ample line bundles vanishes in positive degrees, in arbitrary characteristic. This extends to nef line bundles when the base field has characteristic zero or sufficiently large characteristic. Along the way, we prove that Lusztig varieties are Frobenius split in positive characteristic and that their open cells are affine. We also prove that the open cells in Deligne-Lusztig varieties are affine, settling a question that has been open since the foundational paper of Deligne and Lusztig. In the second part, we explore their relationship with regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties. Both varieties admit Tymoczko's dot action of $W$ on their (intersection) cohomology. We associate to each element $w$ in $W$ a Hessenberg space using the tangent cone of the Schubert variety associated with $w$, and show that the cohomology of the associated regular semisimple Lusztig varieties and Hessenberg varieties is isomorphic as graded $W$-representations when they are smooth. This relationship extends to the level of varieties: we construct a flat degeneration of regular semisimple Lusztig varieties to regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties. In particular, this proves a conjecture of Abreu and Nigro on the homeomorphism types of regular semisimple Lusztig varieties in type $A$, and generalizes it to arbitrary Lie types.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tianyu Ni, Hui Xue &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $S_k$ denote the space of cusp forms of weight $k$ and level one. For $0\leq t\leq k-2$ and primitive Dirichlet character $χ$ mod $D$, we introduce twisted periods $r_{t,χ}$ on $S_k$. We show that for a fixed natural number $n$, if $k$ is sufficiently large relative to $n$ and $D$, then any $n$ periods with the same twist but different indices are linearly independent. We also prove that if $k$ is sufficiently large relative to $D$ then any $n$ periods with the same index but different twists mod $D$ are linearly independent. These results are achieved by studying the trace of the products and Rankin-Cohen brackets of Eisenstein series of level $D$ with nebentypus. Moreover, we give two applications of our method. First, we prove certain identities that evaluate convolution sums of twisted divisor functions. Second, we show that Maeda's conjecture implies a non-vanishing result on twisted central $L$-values of normalized Hecke eigenforms.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages, 3 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the prime trees associated with a finite subset $P$ of the set of all prime numbers, and provide conditions under which the tree is of finite type. Moreover, we compute the density of finite-type subsets $P$. As an application, we show that for weight $k \ge 2$ and levels $N = N'\prod_{p \in P} p^{a_p}$, where $N'$ is squarefree and $a_{p} \geq 2$, every cusp form $f \in \mathcal{S}_k(Γ_0(N))$ can be expressed as a linear combination of products of two specific Eisenstein series whenever $P$ is of finite type.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Alejandro Borda, Julian Rincon, César Galindo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** quant-ph &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 20 pages. Extended the analysis to include non-Clifford permutations as universal resources for prime and prime-power dimensions

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Clifford group is efficiently classically simulable, and universality is obtained by supplementing it with non-Clifford resources. We determine which single-qudit gates suffice to achieve universality. We show that the structure of such resources is governed by the prime factorization of the qudit dimension $d$. Using the adjoint action on the space of complex trace-zero matrices, we relate density to irreducibility together with an infiniteness criterion, yielding a trichotomy based on the factorization of $d$. When $d$ is prime, any non-Clifford gate generates a dense subgroup of the determinant-one unitaries. If $d$ is a prime power, the adjoint action is reducible, and universality requires gates that couple the resulting invariant subspaces. For composite $d$ with pairwise coprime factors, generalized intra-qudit controlled-NOT gates connecting the factors already suffice. These findings suggest that ``composite architectures'' -- hybrid registers combining incommensurate dimensions -- offer a route to bypass the standard overhead associated with magic-state injection.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-30 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Barinder S. Banwait, Xiaoyu Huang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recent work of Burungale-Skinner-Tian-Wan established the first infinite families of quadratic twists of non-CM elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ for which the strong Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) conjecture holds. Building on their results, we encode the required hypotheses into an explicit algorithm and apply it to the database of elliptic curves in the $L$-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB), identifying all elliptic curves $E$ of conductor at most $500{,}000$ that admit infinitely many quadratic twists satisfying the strong BSD conjecture. Our computations provide certain numerical evidence for a conjecture of Radziwiłł and Soundararajan predicting Gaussian behavior in the analytic order of the Shafarevich-Tate group, while also observing a systematic positive bias within the BSD-satisfying subfamily.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 46 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2001, Chow developed the theory of the $B_n$ posets $P$ and the type $B$ $P$-partition enumerators $K^B_P$. To provide a representation-theoretic interpretation of $K^B_P$, we define the poset modules $M^B_P$ of the 0-Hecke algebra $H_n^B(0)$ of type $B$ by endowing the set of type-$B$ linear extensions of $P$ with an $H_n^B(0)$-action. We then show that the Grothendieck group of the category associated to type-$B$ poset modules is isomorphic to the space of type $B$ quasisymmetric functions as both a $\mathrm{QSym}$-module and comodule, where $\mathrm{QSym}$ denotes the Hopf algebra of quasisymmetric functions. Considering an equivalence relation on $B_n$ posets, where two posets are equivalent if they share the same set of type-$B$ linear extensions, we identify a natural representative of each equivalence class, which we call a distinguished poset. We further characterize the distinguished posets whose sets of type-$B$ linear extensions form intervals in the right weak Bruhat order on the the hyperoctahedral groups. Finally, we discuss the relationship among the categories associated to type-$B$ weak Bruhat interval modules, $B_n$ poset modules, and finite-dimensional $H_n^B(0)$-modules.</p></details>

These conjectures are certain generalizations of Okounkov's conjecture on the log-concavity of the Littlewood--Richardson coefficients and the Schur log-concavity theorem of Lam--Postnikov--Pylyavskyy. We prove our conjectures in some special cases and discuss some implications of these conjectures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given an idempotent complete additive category, we show the there is an explicitly constructed topological space such that the lattice of exact substructures is anti-isomorphic to the lattice of closed subsets. In the special case that the additive category has weak cokernels, this topological space is an open subset of the Ziegler spectrum and this is a result of Kevin Schlegel. We also look at some module categories of rings where the Ziegler spectrum is known and calculate the global dimensions of the corresponding exact substructures.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Kazhdan Lusztig isomorphism, relating the affine Hecke algebra of a $p$-adic group to the equivariant $K$ theory of the Steinberg variety of its Langlands dual, played a key role in the proof of the Deligne Langlands conjectures concerning the classification of smooth irreducible representations with an Iwahori fixed vector. In this work we state and prove a relative version of the Kazhdan Lusztig isomorphism for the symmetric pair $(GL_{2n},Sp_{2n})$. The relative isomorphism is an isomorphism between the module of compactly supported Iwahori invariant functions on $X=GL_{2n}/Sp_{2n}$ and another module over the affine Hecke algebra constructed using equivariant $K$ theory and the relative Langlands duality. We use this isomorphism to give a new proof of a condition on $X$ distinguished representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the average number of representations of an integer $n$ as $n = φ(n_{1}) + \dots + φ(n_{j})$, for polynomials $φ\in \mathbb{Z}[n]$ with $\partialφ= k\ge 1$, $\mathrm{lead}(φ) = 1$, $j \ge k$, where $n_{i}$ is a prime power for each $i \in \{1, \dots, j\}$. We extend the results of Languasco and Zaccagnini (2019), for $k=3$ and $j=4$, and of Cantarini, Gambini and Zaccagnini (2020), where they focused on monomials $φ(n) = n^k$, $k\ge 2$ and $j=k, k + 1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2015, Lusztig [Bull. Inst. Math. Acad. Sin. (N.S.)10(2015), no.1, 1-72] showed that for a connected reductive group over an algebraic closure of a finite field the associated (geometric) Hecke category admits a truncation in a two-sided Kazhdan--Lusztig cell, making it a categorification of the asymptotic algebra (J-ring), and that the categorical center of this "asymptotic Hecke category" is equivalent to the category of unipotent character sheaves supported in the cell. Subsequently, Lusztig noted that an asymptotic Hecke category can be constructed for any finite Coxeter group using Soergel bimodules. Lusztig conjectured that the centers of these categories are modular tensor categories (which was then proven by Elias and Williamson) and that for non-crystallographic finite Coxeter groups the S-matrices coincide with the Fourier matrices that were constructed in the 1990s by Lusztig, Malle, and Broué--Malle. If the conjecture is true, the centers may be considered as categories of "unipotent character sheaves" for non-crystallographic finite Coxeter groups. In this paper, we show that the conjecture is true for dihedral groups and for some (we cannot resolve all) cells of H3 and H4. The key ingredient is the method of H-reduction and the identification of the (reduced) asymptotic Hecke category with known categories whose center is already known as well. We conclude by studying the asymptotic Hecke category and its center for some infinite Coxeter groups with a finite cell.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Weyl symbolic calculus of operators leads to the construction, if one takes for symbol a certain distribution decomposing over the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, of an operator with the following property: the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the validity of a collection of estimates involving this operator. Pseudodifferential arithmetic, a novel chapter of pseudodifferential operator theory, makes it possible to make the operator under study fully explicit.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a calculus that gives an elementary approach to enumerate partition-like objects using an infinite upper-triangular number-theoretic matrix. We call this matrix the Partition-Frequency Enumeration (PFE) matrix. This matrix unifies a large number of results connecting number-theoretic functions to partition-type functions. The calculus is extended to arbitrary generating functions, and functions with Weierstrass products. As a by-product, we recover (and extend) some well-known recurrence relations for many number-theoretic functions, including the sum of divisors function, Ramanujan's $τ$ function, sums of squares and triangular numbers, and for $ζ(2n)$, where $n$ is a positive integer. These include classical results due to Euler, Ewell, Ramanujan, Lehmer and others. As one application, we embed Ramanujan's famous congruences $p(5n+4)\equiv 0$ (mod $5)$ and $τ(5n+5)\equiv 0$ (mod $5)$ into an infinite family of such congruences.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any finite totally ordered set, the multisets of intervals form an abelian category. Various classes of subcategories admit natural combinatorial descriptions, and counting them yields familiar integer sequences. Surprisingly, in some cases new integer sequences arise. The formulation of this counting problem leads to a universal construction which assigns to any poset a finitely cocomplete additive category; it is abelian when the poset is finite and does not depend on the choice of any ring of coefficients. For a general poset the universal category of representations is abelian if and only if for the lattice of ideals the meet of two compact elements is again compact.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any $π$-formal group scheme $G$, the Frobenius morphism between arithmetic jet spaces restricts to generalized kernels of the projection map. Using the functorial properties of such kernels of arithmetic jet spaces, we show that this morphism is indeed induced by a natural ring map between shifted $π$-typical Witt vectors. In the special case when $G = \hat{\mathbb{G}}_a$, the arithmetic jet space, as well as the generalized kernels are affine $π$-formal planes with Witt vector addition as the group law. In that case the above morphism is the multiplication by $π$ map on Witt vector schemes. In fact, the system of arithmetic jet spaces and generalized kernels of any $π$-formal group scheme $G$ along with their maps and identitites satisfied among them are a generalization of the case of the Witt vector scheme with the system of maps such as the Frobenius, Verschiebung and multiplication by $π$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a comprehensive generalization of Lusztig's braid group symmetries for quasi-split iquantum groups. Specifically, we give 3 explicit rank one formulas for symmetries acting on integrable modules over a quasi-split iquantum group of arbitrary Kac-Moody type with general parameters. These symmetries are formulated in terms of idivided powers and iweights of the vectors being acted upon. We show that these symmetries are consistent with the relative braid group symmetries on iquantum groups, and they are also related to Lusztig's symmetries via quasi $K$-matrices. Furthermore, through appropriate rescaling, we obtain compatible symmetries for the integral forms of modified iquantum groups and their integrable modules. We verify that these symmetries satisfy the relative braid group relations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb{Z}_K$ denote the ring of integers of the number field $K = \mathbb{Q}(θ)$, where $θ$ is a root of the monic irreducible polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$. We say that $f(x)$ is monogenic if $\mathbb{Z}_K = \mathbb{Z}[θ]$. A polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ is called reciprocal if $f(x) = x^{\mathrm{deg}(f)} f(1/x)$. In this article, we derive sufficient conditions for the monogeneity of even degree reciprocal polynomials. By employing properties of the discriminant of reciprocal polynomials, we partially prove a conjecture proposed by Jones in $2021$. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound on the number of certain sextic monogenic reciprocal polynomials.</p></details>

We address 13 problems that were marked 'Open' in the database: 5 through seemingly novel autonomous solutions, and 8 through identification of previous solutions in the existing literature. Our findings suggest that the 'Open' status of the problems was through obscurity rather than difficulty. We also identify and discuss issues arising in applying AI to math conjectures at scale, highlighting the difficulty of literature identification and the risk of ''subconscious plagiarism'' by AI.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we completely describe the family of integrally closed Noetherian domains between $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ and $\mathbb{Q}[X]$. We accomplish this result by classifying the Krull domains between these two polynomial rings. To this end, we first describe the DVRs of $\mathbb{Q}(X)$ lying over $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ for some prime $p \in \mathbb{Z}$, by distinguishing them according to whether the extension of the residue fields is algebraic or transcendental. We unify the known descriptions of such valuations by considering ultrametric balls in $\mathbb{C}_p$, the completion of the algebraic closure of the field $\mathbb{Q}_p$ of $p$-adic numbers. We then study when the intersection $R$ of such DVRs with $\mathbb{Q}[X]$ is of finite character, so that $R$ is a Krull domain, and we finally compute the divisor class group of $R$. It turns out that such a ring is formed by those polynomials which simultaneously map a finite union of ultrametric balls of $\mathbb{C}_p$ to its valuation domain $\mathbb{O}_p$, as $p\in\mathbb{Z}$ ranges through the set of primes. By a result of Heinzer, the Krull domains of this class are precisely the integrally closed Noetherian domains between $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ and $\mathbb{Q}[X]$. This novel approach provides a geometric understanding of this class of integrally closed domains. Furthermore, we also describe the UFDs between $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ and $\mathbb{Q}[X]$.</p></details>

We characterize all finite categories $X$ for which the indecomposables in the additive image coincide with the indecomposable indicator representations and provide examples of quivers of wild representation type where the additive image contains only finitely many indecomposables. Motivated by questions in topological data analysis, we conduct a detailed analysis of the additive image for finite grids. In particular, we show that for grids of infinite representation type, there exist infinitely many indecomposables both within and outside the additive image. We develop an algorithm for determining if a representation of a finite category is in the additive image. In addition, we investigate conditions for realizability and the effect of modifications of the source category and the underlying field. The paper concludes with a discussion of the additive image of $\mathrm{H}_n(-,F)$ for an arbitrary field $F$, extending previous work for prime fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime. An oriented pro-$p$ group $(G,θ)$ is said to have the Bogomolov--Positselski property if it is Kummerian and if $I_θ(G)$ is a free pro-$p$ group. In this paper, we provide a new criterion for an oriented pro-$p$ group to satisfy the Bogomolov--Positselski property. This criterion builds on earlier work of Positselski (arXiv:1405.0965) and Quadrelli--Weigel (arXiv:2103.12438), relates their approaches, and answers a question raised in (arXiv:2103.12438). Under additional assumptions, we obtain two further sufficient criteria. The first is analogous to a Merkurjev--Suslin type statement. The second allows one to weaken the hypotheses appearing in Positselski's criterion (arXiv:1405.0965 Theorem 2). Finally, we show that the stronger conditions are satisfied by pro-$p$ groups of elementary type. As a consequence, the Elementary Type Conjecture implies Positselski's ``Module Koszulity Conjecture 1'' (arXiv:1008.0095) for fields with finitely generated maximal pro-$p$ Galois group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define fully exact module categories, a subclass of exact module categories over a finite braided tensor category that is stable under the relative Deligne product. In contrast, we demonstrate with examples in both zero and non-zero characteristic of the base field that the class of exact module categories is not stable under this product. We also observe in examples that fully exact module categories form a dense subset in the class of exact ones. The monoidal 2-category of fully exact module categories strictly contains those of invertible and separable module categories. In fact, we show that each internal algebra of a fully exact module category is projectively separable, a generalization of separable algebras involving projective objects. In the semisimple case, a module category is fully exact if and only if it is separable. In general, fully exact module categories are not dualizable inside their class, but if they are, they are fully dualizable objects in the monoidal 2-category of finite module categories. We call such module categories perfect. We show that perfect module categories form a rigid monoidal 2-subcategory containing all fully dualizable objects. Therefore, we propose perfect module categories as a model for finite tensor 2-categories. If the braiding is symmetric, a module category is fully exact if and only if it is perfect. As a detailed example, we classify fully exact, and hence perfect, module categories over the symmetric tensor category of modules over Sweedler's four-dimensional Hopf algebra and compute their relative Deligne products, and the categories of 1-morphisms. For a general quasi-triangular Hopf algebra, we analyze when the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces is fully exact. We show that this is not the case for both Sweedler's Hopf algebra and Lusztig's factorizable small quantum group of type $A_1$ at an odd root of unity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we present criteria in terms of dual pairs of exceptional sequences for an abelian category to be highest weight. The criteria are applied in three situations of geometric origin. We give new proofs for the facts that the category of perverse sheaves of middle perversity on complex-analytic manifolds with suitable conditions on the stratification is highest weight and that the derived coherent category of any Grassmannian has a $t$-structure with highest weight heart. Also we show that the abelian null category of any proper birational morphism of regular surfaces is highest weight. For this null category, we give a geometric description of some special objects related to the highest weight structure, such as standard, costandard and characteristic tilting objects.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For integers $n,k \geq 1$, let $S_k(n)$ denote the power sum $1^k +2^k + \cdots + n^k$. In this note, we first recall the minimal recurrence relation connecting $S_k(n)$ and $S_{k-1}(n)$ established by Abramovich (1973). We then discuss an old algorithm to determine the coefficients of the power sum polynomial $S_k(n)$ in terms of the coefficients of $S_{k-1}(n)$ (see, e.g., Bloom (1993) and Owens (1992)). Moreover, we bring to light an explicit relationship between $S_k(n)$ and $S_{k+1}(n)$ put forward by Budin and Cantor (1972). We conclude that these procedures (including the integration formula expressing $S_k(n)$ in terms of $S_{k-1}(n)$) all constitute equivalent methods to determine $S_k(n)$ starting from $S_{k-1}(n)$. In addition, as a by-product, we provide a determinantal formula for the Bernoulli numbers involving the binomial coefficients.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a curve $C$ over a number field $K$ equipped with the action of a finite group $G$ by $K$-automorphisms, one obtains a factorisation of $L(C,s)$ into a product of $L$-functions of `motivic pieces of curves' associated to irreducible $G$-representations. We describe an algorithm for explicitly computing values of these $L$-functions, demonstrating implementations in the cases of certain curves with actions by $C_3$, $C_4$ and $D_{10}$. We explain how this algorithm can be used to factor $L$-functions of curves with endomorphisms of Hecke type. Towards applications, we explicitly formulate and numerically verify a version of Deligne's Period Conjecture for hitherto-uninvestigated $L$-functions arising from motivic pieces of superelliptic curves.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the birational geometry of the Kummer surfaces associated to the Jacobian varieties of genus two curves, with a particular focus on fields of characteristic two. In order to do so, we explicitly compute a projective embedding of the Jacobian of a general genus two curve and, from this, we construct its associated Kummer surface. This explicit construction produces a model for desingularised Kummer surfaces over any field of characteristic not two, and specialising these equations to characteristic two provides a model of a partial desingularisation. Adapting the classic description of the Picard lattice in terms of tropes, we also describe how to explicitly find completely desingularised models of Kummer surfaces whenever the $p$-rank is not zero. In the final section of this paper, we compute an example of a Kummer surface with everywhere good reduction over a quadratic number field, and draw connections between the models we computed and a criterion that determines when a Kummer surface has good reduction at two.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the center of the affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{n|1}$ at the critical level is generated by the coefficients in the expansion of the pseudo-differential operator $(\partial_z-u_1(z))\cdots (\partial_z-u_n(z))(\partial_z+u_{n+1}(z))^{-1}$ taking values in the Cartan subalgebra. This is an affine analogue of the Harish-Chandra isomorphism in the finite case. The key ingredient of the proof is the identification of the center with the Heisenberg coset of the regular W-superalgebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_{n|1}$ at the critical level, whose associated graded algebra is realized as the affine supersymmetric polynomials. Based on this, we derive a character formula for the center, which coincides with the generating function of plane partitions with a pit condition. We also prove that the Heisenberg coset at generic levels has a similar interpretation in terms of pseudo-differential operators that deform the one at the critical level.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is concerned with local cohomology sheaves on generalized flag varieties supported in closed Schubert varieties, which carry natural structures as (mixed Hodge) D-modules. We employ Kazhdan--Lusztig theory and Saito's theory of mixed Hodge modules to describe a general strategy to calculate the simple composition factors, Hodge filtration, and weight filtration on these modules. Our main tool is the Grothendieck--Cousin complex, introduced by Kempf, which allows us to relate the local cohomology modules in question to parabolic Verma modules over the corresponding Lie algebra. We show that this complex underlies a complex of mixed Hodge modules, and is thus endowed with Hodge and weight filtrations. As a consequence, strictness implies that computing cohomology commutes with taking associated graded with respect to both of these filtrations. We execute this strategy to calculate the composition factors and weight filtration for Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian, in particular showing that the weight filtration is controlled by the augmented Dyck patterns of Raicu--Weyman. As an application, upon restriction to the opposite big cell, we recover the simple composition factors and weight filtration on local cohomology with support in generic determinantal varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>One of the starting points of this work was the duality of Borcea relating standard level $k$ representations of $A_1^{(1)}$ and level $2k+1$ of $A_2^{(2)}$. For $k=1$ the combinatorial bases in both cases yield the two Capparelli identities and we wanted to see if there is a correspondence between the bases in terms of partitions for all $k\in\mathbb N$. By using the vertex operator relations in the principal picture for level $5$ standard $A_2^{(2)}$-modules we reduce a spanning set of Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt-type vectors in $L(5Λ_0)$ by removing the leading terms of relations and rendering a list of 34 ``difference'' conditions for partitions.We have with computer programs sorted out the sets of partitions satisfying these conditions and formed the partial generating series which agrees with the principally specialized character for all powers of $q$ up to $41$. Although our list of leading terms is incomplete, our results show that the corresponding combinatorial identity for $L_{A_2^{(2)}}(5Λ_0)$ drastically differs from the one for the Borcea dual $L_{A_1^{(1)}}(2Λ_0)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the relation between end-to-end equivariance and layerwise equivariance in deep neural networks. We prove the following: For a network whose end-to-end function is equivariant with respect to group actions on the input and output spaces, there is a parameter choice yielding the same end-to-end function such that its layers are equivariant with respect to some group actions on the latent spaces. Our result assumes that the parameters of the model are identifiable in an appropriate sense. This identifiability property has been established in the literature for a large class of networks, to which our results apply immediately, while it is conjectural for others. The theory we develop is grounded in an abstract formalism, and is therefore architecture-agnostic. Overall, our results provide a mathematical explanation for the emergence of equivariant structures in the weights of neural networks during training -- a phenomenon that is consistently observed in practice.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop (quantum) cluster algebra structures over arbitrary commutative unital rings $\Bbbk$ and prove that the (quantized) coordinate rings of connected simply-connected complex simple algebraic groups $G$ over $\Bbbk$ admit such structures. We first show that the integral form of the quantized coordinate ring of $G$ admits an upper quantum cluster algebra structure over $\mathbb{A}=\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm\frac{1}{2}}]$ by using a combination of tools from quantum groups, canonical bases and cluster algebras and a previous result of the second and third authors over $\mathbb{Q}(q^{\frac{1}{2}})$. We then obtain (integral) quantum versions of recent results of the first author: when $G$ is not of type $F_4$, the quantized coordinate ring of $G$ admits a quantum cluster algebra structure over $\mathbb{A}'$, where $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{A}$ when $G$ is not of types $G_2$, $E_8$, and $F_4$; $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{A}[(q^2+1)^{-1}]$ when $G$ is of type $G_2$, and $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{Q}(q^{\frac{1}{2}})$ when $G$ is of type $E_8$. We furthermore prove that the classical versions of these results hold over $\mathbb{A}'$ (where $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{Z}$ if $G$ is not of type $F_4$ or $G_2$ and $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{2}]$ if $G$ is of type $G_2$) and that the integral form of the coordinate ring of $G$ of type $F_4$ is an upper cluster algebra. Finally, by using common triangular bases of (quantum) cluster algebras, we prove that the above results also hold under specializations of $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{A}'$ to commutative unital rings $\Bbbk$.</p></details>

In mathematical terms the problem can be formulated as follows. Given a semi-simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ and a $\mathfrak g$-module $V$, one may ask about the structure of the sub-ring of $\mathfrak g$-invariants inside the ring freely generated by the module. We point out how some information about the ring of invariants may be obtained by studying an extended Lie algebra.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a triangulated category $\mathscr S$ that admits a full and strong exceptional sequence of three objects with one-dimensional Hom spaces. We show that the isomorphism classes of exact functors from $\mathscr S$ to another triangulated category $\mathscr T$ are in bijection with the isomorphism classes of octahedra in $\mathscr T$ satisfying a natural condition. As an application, we construct an exact functor from $\mathscr S$ to $\mathbf D^b(\Bbbk[x]\text{-}\mathrm{mod})$ that does not admit a dg lift. This provides an explicit example of a non-Fourier-Mukai exact functor between $\mathbf D^b(\mathbb P^2)$ and $\mathbf D^b(\mathbb P^1)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ and a nontrivial element $σ$ of its Shafarevich--Tate group, we introduce the Visualization category $\mathcal{V}(E; σ)$ of abelian varieties that ``visualize'' $σ$ in the sense of Mazur, and we study minimal objects in this category. In particular, we show that there can be several minimal visualizing abelian varieties of different dimensions, answering a question of Mazur. In the case that $σ$ has order $2$ or $3$, we revisit two constructions of visualizing abelian varieties, due to Agashe and Stein, and Cremona and Mazur. We show that the Agashe--Stein construction always yields minimal visualizations for these orders. We also build upon the Cremona--Mazur construction and show how it can be made totally explicit. While the Cremona--Mazur construction can produce non-minimal objects, an appropriate choice in the construction for order $2$ elements $σ$ yields an explicit genus $2$ curve whose Jacobian is a minimal visualization. For order $3$ elements we apply our algorithmic construction to Fisher's database of such elements, and obtain computational evidence that, in the majority of cases, the Cremona--Mazur construction yields a minimal visualization.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 49 pages; The exposition has been improved. Several inaccuracies corrected. Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a revised notion of depth for Langlands parameters for tori defined over a nonarchimedean local field \(F\) that restores depth preservation under the local Langlands correspondence (LLC). We leverage that preservation to derive structural results that, taken together, yield a canonical transfer of broad harmonic-analytic results from characteristic \(0\) to characteristic \(p\). When \(F\) has suitably large positive characteristic, we prove a block-by-block equivalence: each Bernstein block of \(G(F)\) is equivalent to a corresponding block for some \(G'(F')\) with \(F'\) of characteristic \(0\) \(\ell\)-close to \(F\); using this, we show that a LLC in characteristic \(0\) corresponds canonically to a LLC in characteristic \(p\). For regular supercuspidals we give a direct, more structured construction via Kaletha. Along the way we recover and extend results on \(\ell\)-close fields -- introducing a depth-transfer function generalizing the normalized Hasse--Herbrand function, proving truncated isomorphisms for arbitrary tori and parahorics, establishing a depth and supercuspidality preserving Kazhdan-type Hecke-algebra isomorphism for arbitrary maximal parahorics of arbitrary connected reductive groups; and a generalized Cartan decomposition for arbitrary maximal parahorics -- thereby subsuming several earlier results in the literature. Collectively, the results let one work in characteristic \(0\) without loss of generality for a wide swath of harmonic analysis on \(p\)-adic groups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 36 pages, 11 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There are two objectives to this work: to classify all tame integer tilings and to classify all tame integer hypertilings. Motivation for the first objective comes from Conway and Coxeter's modelling of positive integer friezes using triangulated polygons, which has received significant attention since the discovery of cluster algebras by Fomin and Zelevinsky in 2002. Assem, Reutenauer, and Smith introduced $\text{SL}_2$-tilings as generalisations of friezes, and Bessenrodt, Holm, and Jørgensen classified positive integer $\text{SL}_2$-tilings using infinite triangulated polygons. Here we consider $N$-tilings, of which $\text{SL}_2$-tilings are the case $N=1$. We provide a geometric model for all tame integer $N$-tilings using a generalisation of the Farey graph in the hyperbolic plane. Highlights of this model include classifications of all positive integer $N$-tilings and of all quiddity sequences of positive rational friezes using triangulated polygons. The second objective is motivated by Bhargava's celebrated study of binary quadratic forms using integer cubes and by an observation of Demonet et al.\ that there is essentially only one three-dimensional positive integer tiling with $\text{SL}_2$ cross sections. We consider a richer class of three-dimensional tilings, which we call hypertilings, using the Cayley hyperdeterminant. We classify all tame integer hypertilings using generalised Farey graphs; remarkably, those with Cayley hyperdeterminant 1 prove to have a simple description in terms of triple Hadamard products of integer pairs.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 27 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop and numerically analyze an algebraic-geometric framework for spin-adapted coupled-cluster (CC) theory. Since the electronic Hamiltonian is SU(2)-invariant, physically relevant quantum states lie in the spin singlet sector. We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Craig, van Ittersum, and Ono conjectured that every prime-detecting quasimodular form of level $1$ is a quasimodular Eisenstein series. This conjecture was proved by Kane--Krishnamoorthy--Lau and by van Ittersum--Mauth--Ono--Singh independently. However, in higher levels, prime-detecting quasimodular forms need not be Eisenstein. Recently, Kane, Krishnamoorthy, and Lau formulated a natural higher level analogue of the above conjecture and proved it by analytic methods. In a similar direction, but via an alternative approach based on the independence of characters of $\ell$-adic Galois representations, we prove that any prime-detecting quasimodular form on $Γ_{0}(N)$ belongs to the direct sum of the spaces of quasimodular Eisenstein series and quasimodular oldforms. Moreover, for a quasimodular form $f$ that is not prime-detecting, we give an upper bound for the number of primes $p$ less than $X$ for which the $p$-th Fourier coefficient of a quasimodular form vanishes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbf{G}=\mathrm{U}(2,n)$ be the unitary group associated to a Hermitian space over a quadratic imaginary number field $E$. We assume that 2 is unramified in $E$, and the Hermitian space splits at all finite places and has signature $(2,n)$, where $n\equiv 2 \mathrm{mod} 4$. A theory of Fourier expansions of quaternionic modular forms on $\mathbf{G}$ is developed by Hilado, McGlade, and Yan. In this paper, we define a family of degenerate Heisenberg Eisenstein series $E_{\ell}$ for $\ell>n$ on $\mathbf{G}$, which is a weight $\ell$ quaternionic modular form, and we explicitly compute their Fourier expansions. We prove that the Fourier coefficients of $E_{\ell}$ are rational in a certain sense, and that their denominators are uniformly bounded by an integer depending only on $\ell,n$, and $E$. This provides the first family of quaternionic Eisenstein series whose Fourier coefficients are known to be rational or algebraic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop vanishing and cuspidality criteria for quaternionic modular forms on $G=\mathrm{Spin}(4,4)$ using a theory of scalar Fourier coefficients. By analyzing a Fourier-Jacobi expansion for these forms, we prove that a level one quaternionic modular form on $G$ vanishes if and only if its primitive Fourier coefficients are zero. Using this criterion, we characterize Pollack's quaternionic Saito-Kurokawa subspace by imposing a system of linear relation among certain primitive Fourier coefficients. This characterization strengthens earlier work of the author with Johnson-Leung, Negrini, Pollack, and Roy. We also study quaternionic modular forms in the more general setting of a group $G_J$ associated to a cubic norm structure $J$. Here we establish a new relationship between the degenerate Fourier coefficients of quaternionic modular forms, and the Fourier coefficients of the holomorphic modular forms associated to their constant terms. As a consequence, we prove that in weights $\ell\geq 5$, a level one quaternionic modular form on $G$ is cuspidal if and only if its non-degenerate Fourier coefficients satisfy a polynomial growth condition.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1963, Edward Spence published a proof of the following With $φ$ being Euler totient function, if $n>1$ is an integer, and if \begin{equation*} 0<a_1<\cdots<a_{φ(n)}<n, \end{equation*} are the positive integers less than $n$, coprime with $n$, then \begin{equation*} \sum_{j=1}^{φ(n)}ja_j = \frac{φ(n)}{24}\left(8nφ(n)+6n+2φ(m)(-1)^{ω(m)}-2^{ω(m)}\right), \end{equation*} where $m$ is the square-free part of $n$ and $ω(m)$ is the number of prime factors of $m$. Spence's proof relies on an ingenious observation considering Nagell's totient function. Later in 1971, Lucien Van Hamme provided an alternative proof of the result using Fourier analysis and previous work from Hubert Delange in 1968. In this paper I propose another proof of the formula using the reciprocity law for Dedekind sums. If the formula is of interest on its own, it also plays a role in the analysis of the distribution of the $a_j$ as suggested by the work from Hubert Delange.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given an integer $D$ and an ordinary isogeny class of abelian varieties defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with commutative $\mathbb{F}_q$-endomorphism algebra, we provide algorithms for computing all isogenies of degree dividing $D$ and polarizations of degree dividing $D$. We discuss phenomena that arise for higher dimension abelian varieties but not elliptic curves, bounds on the diameter of the graph of minimal isogenies, and decompositions of isogeny graphs into orbits for the Picard group of the Frobenius order.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is devoted to the quantum integrable structure of Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models, formed by an infinite number of commuting Integrals of Motion (IMs) in their current algebra. Focusing for simplicity on the SU(2) case, we obtain the first four commuting higher-spin local IMs, starting from a general SU(2)-invariant ansatz and imposing their commutativity. We further show evidence of their commutativity with quantum non-local IMs, which were already built in the literature as Kondo defects. We then investigate the diagonalization of these local operators on $\widehat{\mathfrak{su}(2)}_k$ Verma modules: we explicitly find the first few eigenvectors and further discuss the affine Bethe ansatz and ODE/IQFT conjectures, which predict the full eigenstates and spectrum of the integrable structure. Our results show a perfect match between the direct diagonalization and these overarching conjectures. We conclude by discussing several outlooks, including multi-current generalisations, massive deformations and a general long-term program towards the first principle quantisation of 2-dimensional integrable sigma-models.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Extending Katz-Sarnak heuristics, Ballini-Lombardo-Verzobio [BLV25] conjectures a limiting distribution as $p \to \infty$ for $\# A_g(\mathbb F_p,t)$, the number of $g$-dimensional PPAVs over $\mathbb F_p$ with trace $t$, as a product of natural local factors $v_\ell(t)$ for non-archimedean places $\ell$ and the Sato-Tate measure $\text{ST}_g$ corresponding to $\infty$. We prove that their conjecture is true for all $g$. As a consequence, we obtain analogous results on the distribution of curves of genus $2$ and $3$, answering questions of Bergström-Howe-García-Ritzenthaler [BHLR24] and [BLV25].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of geometric purity in rigidly-compactly generated tt-categories by considering exact triangles that are pure at each tt-stalk. We develop a systematic study of this concept, including examples and applications. In particular, we show that geometric purity is, in general, strictly stronger than ordinary purity, and that it naturally leads to the notion of geometrically pure-injective objects. We prove that such objects arise as pushforwards of pure-injective objects from suitable tt-stalks. Moreover, we give a detailed analysis of indecomposable geometrically pure-injective objects in the derived category of the projective line. Under mild additional assumptions, we identify the geometric part of the Ziegler spectrum as a closed subset. As an application, we demonstrate that this new notion of purity can be used to tackle the problem of spatiality of the frame of smashing ideals via the geometric Ziegler spectrum. In particular, we show that our approach rules out the counterexamples of Balchin and Stevenson to existing methods.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we establish new irrationality criteria for certain sparse power series. As applications of these criteria, we generalize a result of Erdős and obtain several irrationality results for various infinite series involving the classical arithmetic functions. For example, we prove that for any integers $t\ge2$ and $k\geq0$, the numbers $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{d(n)^k}{t^{σ(n)}} \quad\text{and}\quad \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{d(n)^k}{t^{φ(n)}} $$ are both irrational, where $d(n)$, $σ(n)$, and $φ(n)$ denote the number of divisors, the sum of divisors, and Euler's totient functions, respectively.</p></details>
