### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13669v1'>2512.13669</a>\]&nbsp; **Poisson--Dirichlet approximation for counting integers with divisors in an interval**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tony Haddad &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 16 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a simple inequality that compares the laws of two random variables taking values in a convex set of any normed vector space. By combining it with Arratia's coupling, recently refined by Koukoulopoulos and the author, we present a general strategy to reduce the problem of finding an asymptotic formula for the number of integers whose prime factorization falls into any given subset of $\ell^1(\mathbb R)$, to finding upper bounds for two key probabilities measuring proximity to the boundary of the subset in question. We apply this strategy to give an asymptotic formula for counting integers in $[1, x]$ that have a divisor in an interval $(y, z)$ with $z/y \to \infty$ as $x \to \infty$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Edmund Harriss, Henna Koivusalo, James J. Walton &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DS &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cut and project sets are obtained by projecting an irrational slice through a lattice to a lower dimensional subspace. Under standard conditions, the resulting pattern has no translational periods even though it retains some regularity of the lattice. Cut and project sets are one of the archetypical examples of patterns featuring aperiodic order, the other construction methods being by substitution and matching rules. Many early examples of aperiodic tilings, including the famous Penrose and Ammann--Beenker tilings, have a description from all of these methods. In this article we answer the following question, in the case of a Euclidean total space: what property of the cut and project data characterises when the resulting cut and project sets may also be defined by a substitution rule?</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ali Partofard &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the integral models of meta-unitary Shimura varieties through the lens of Scholze's fiber product conjecture. Reformulating Bultel's original construction in terms of moduli stacks of Shtukas and Igusa stacks, we prove the validity of the fiber product formula for this class of non-abelian type Shimura varieties, thereby generalizing the works of Zhang and Daniels, Van Hoften, Kim, and Zhang. We utilize this geometric description to derive local-global compatibility results and, adapting the strategy of Zhu and Yang, apply the unipotent categorical local Langlands correspondence to prove a general vanishing theorem for the generic part of the cohomology of meta-unitary Shimura varieties.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sadie Lipman &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 10 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2006, Boyarchenko and Drinfeld conjectured that for a unipotent algebraic group over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q$, every geometric point is contained in the neutral connected component of its centralizer if and only if its $\mathbb{L}$-packets of character sheaves are singletons. In 2013, Boyarchenko proved the "only if" direction of this conjecture. In this paper, we complete the proof. Along the way, we explore the relationship between general algebraic groups satisfying this property and their Asai twisting operator.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13523v1'>2512.13523</a>\]&nbsp; **On the centralizers of endomorphisms of the projective line**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Alonso Beaumont &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DS &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f$ be a dominant endomorphism of the projective line, which is not conjugate to a power map $z\mapsto z^{\pm d}$. We consider the centralizers of the iterates of $f$, $C(f^{n}):=\{\textrm{dominant}\;g:\mathbb{P}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^{1}\;|\; g\circ f^{n}=f^{n}\circ g\}$, $n\geq1$, and prove that their union is equal to $C(f^{N})$ for some $N\geq1$. This solves a conjecture of F. Pakovich. As an application, we obtain a Tits alternative for cancellative semigroups of endomorphisms of the projective line, without an assumption of finite generation, extending the results of J.P. Bell, K. Huang, W. Peng and T.J. Tucker.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Final version, accepted for publication

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The seminal paper "J.T. Stafford, Module structure of Weyl algebras, J. London Math. Soc. (2) 18 (1978), no. 3, 429--442" was a major step forward in our understanding of Weyl algebras. Beginning with Serre's Theorem on free summands of projective modules and Bass' Stable Range Theorem in commutative algebra, we attempt to trace the origins of this work and explain how it led to Stafford's construction of non-holonomic simple modules over Weyl algebras. We also describe Bernstein-Lunt's geometric construction of infinite families of non-holonomic simple modules. We recall more recent developments related to Weyl algebras, especially that of parametrizing right ideals in the first Weyl algebra and its relation to Calogero-Moser spaces. Finally, we revisit Stafford's results in the context of quantized symplectic singularities, where they lead naturally to open problems on the behaviour of simple modules.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** E. Kowalski, Ph. Michel, W. Sawin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 58 pages; correct inaccuracy in Theorem 4.1 pointed out by A. Florea. Readers interested in the results of this paper may also look at the recent preprint arXiv:2511.09459, joint with Fouvry, which contains generalizations of the main results to much larger classes of trace functions

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove non-trivial bounds for bilinear forms with hyper-Kloosterman sums with characters modulo a prime $q$ which, for both variables of length $M$, are non-trivial as soon as $M\geq q^{3/8+δ}$ for any $δ>0$. This range, which matches Burgess's range, is identical with the best results previously known only for simpler exponentials of monomials. The proof combines refinements of the analytic tools from our previous paper and new geometric methods. The key geometric idea is a comparison statement that shows that even when the "sum-product" sheaves that appear in the analysis fail to be irreducible, their decomposition reflects that of the "input" sheaves, except for parameters in a high-codimension subset. This property is proved by a subtle interplay between étale cohomology in its algebraic and diophantine incarnations. We prove a first application concerning the first moment of a family of $L$-functions of degree $3$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $q$ be an odd prime power, and $G=\text{Sp}(2n,q)$ the finite symplectic group. We give an expression for the total Stiefel-Whitney Classes (SWCs) for orthogonal representations $π$ of $G$, in terms of character values of $π$ at elements of order $2$. We give "universal formulas'' for the fourth and eighth SWCs. For $n=2$, we compute the subring of the mod $2$ cohomology generated by the SWCs $w_k(π)$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Julien Marché, Gregor Masbaum &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 27 pages, 3 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the signature $σ_g(\frac q p)$ of $\mathrm{SU}_2$-TQFT vector spaces associated to surfaces of genus $g$, as a function of the defining root of unity $ζ=e^{iπq/p}$. We prove that $\frac{1}{p^2}σ_2(\frac{q}{p})$ converges to $Λ(θ)=\frac{16}{π^3}\sum\limits_{n\ge 1, \textrm{ odd}}\frac{1}{n^3\sin(nπθ)}$ when $\frac{q}{p}$ goes to an irrational number $θ\in [0,1]$ under certain conditions. We also observe that the function $Λ(θ)$ is the boundary value of an Eichler integral of a level $2$ modular form of weight $4$, and use this to propose a conjectural transformation law for the signature function in genus 2 similar to the reciprocity formula for classical Dedekind sums.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kenza Memlouk &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 42 pages, comments welcome !

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider multiple zeta values, which are periods of mixed Tate motives over $\mathbb Z$. For a given multiple zeta value $ζ$, there exists a unique minimal motive $M(ζ)$ such that $ζ$ is a period of $M(ζ)$. In general, the motive $M(ζ)$ is difficult to compute. In this article, we compute the minimal motive $M(a,b)$ associated to a given double zeta value $ζ(a,b)$. We also compute the motivic Galois group $G(a,b)$ associated to $ζ(a,b)$ and discuss its dimension. Moreover, we give a period matrix of $M(a,b)$. The period conjecture predicts that the dimension of $G(a,b)$ equals the transcendence degree of the algebra of periods of $M(a,b)$. Hence our results lead to conjectures about algebraic relations between single and double zeta values.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Adele Maltempo, Carolina Vallejo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Accepted in the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $N$ be normal subgroup of a finite group $G$, $p$ be a prime, $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ and $θ$ be a $P$-invariant irreducible character of $N$. Suppose that $G/N$ is a $p$-solvable group. In this note we show that, whenever a finite group $A$ acts on $G$ stabilizing $P$, there exists an $A$-equivariant McKay bijection between irreducible characters lying over $θ$ of degree prime to $p$ of $G$ and $\textbf{N}_G(P)$. This is a consequence of a recent result of D. Rossi. Our approach here is independent from Rossi's and follows the original idea of the proof of the McKay conjecture for $p$-solvable groups. In particular, we rely on the so-called Okuyama-Wajima argument to deal with characters above Glauberman correspondents. For this purpose, we generalize a classical result of P. X. Gallagher on the number of irreducible characters of $G$ lying over $θ$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 42 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a conjecture of Odaka--Oshima, which says that there is an algebraic description of the Gromov--Hausdorff compactification of all unit-diameter hyperkähler metrics on K3 surfaces. As a corollary, we obtain a classification of the Gromov--Hausdorff limits of those hyperkähler K3 surfaces with a fixed complex structure or with a fixed polarization.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yu Mao, Mohamed Saidi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In \cite{Ho3}, Hoshi proved that open homomorphisms between solvably closed Galois groups of number fields which are compatible with the cyclotomic characters arise from field embeddings. In this paper, we will prove an $m$-step solvable version of Hoshi's result. More precisely, if $K$ and $L$ are number fields, we will prove that given an open homomorphism between the maximal $m+3$-step solvable Galois groups of $K$ and $L$, where $m \geq 2$, and the induced open homomorphism between the corresponding maximal $m$-step solvable Galois groups, then the latter arises from a field embedding if and only if the open homomorphism between the $m+3$-step solvable (and hence also the $m$-step solvable) Galois groups is compatible with the cyclotomic characters of $K$ and $L$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jieyu Chen, Zengqiang Lin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 19 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian category with a torsion pair $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$. Happel-Reiten-Smalo tilting provides a method to construct a new abelian category $\mathcal{B}$ with a torsion pair associated to $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$, which is exactly the heart of a certain $t$-structure on the bounded derived category $D^b(\mathcal{A})$. In this paper, we mainly study generalized HRS tilting. We first show that an interval of torsion pairs in extriangulated categories with negative first extensions is bijectively associated with torsion pairs in the corresponding heart, which yields several new observations in triangulated categories. Then we obtain a generalization of HRS tilting by replacing hearts of $t$-structures with extended hearts. As an application, we show that certain $t$-structures on triangulated subcategories can be extended to $t$-structures on the whole triangulated categories.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages. Any comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of AIR tilting subcategories of extended hearts of $t$-structures on a triangulated category associated with silting subcategories. This notion extends $τ_{[d]}$-tilting pairs of extended finitely generated modules over finite-dimensional algebras to a broader framework, encompassing extended large modules over unitary rings as well as truncated subcategories of finite-dimensional derived categories of proper non-positive differential graded algebras. Within this framework, we establish a bijection between AIR tilting subcategories and silting subcategories. We further define quasi-tilting and tilting subcategories of extended hearts, generalizing the corresponding notions in module categories, and investigate their fundamental properties and the relationships among these three tilting-related concepts.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ingemar Bengtsson, Markus Grassl &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** quant-ph &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A well supported conjecture states that SIC-POVMs -- maximal sets of complex equiangular lines -- with anti-unitary symmetry give rise to an identity expressing some of its overlaps as squares of the (rescaled) components of a suitably chosen fiducial vector. In number theoretical terms the identity essentially expresses Stark units as sums of products of pairs of square roots of Stark units. We investigate whether the identity is enough to determine these Stark units. The answer is no, but the failure might be quite mild.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-15 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Geoffrey Powell &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A filtration of the morphisms of the $k$-linearization $k \mathbf{FS}$ of the category $\mathbf{FS}$ of finite sets and surjections is constructed using a natural $k \mathbf{FI}^{op}$-module structure induced by restriction, where $\mathbf{FI}$ is the category of finite sets and injections. In particular, this yields the `primitive' subcategory $ k \mathbf{FS}^0 \subset k \mathbf{FS}$ that is of independent interest; for example, the category of $k \mathbf{FS}^0$-modules is closely related to the category of $k \mathbf{FA}$-modules, where $\mathbf{FA}$ is the category of finite sets and all maps. Working over a field of characteristic zero, the subquotients of this filtration are identified as bimodules over $k \mathbf{FB}$, where $\mathbf{FB}$ is the category of finite sets and bijections, also exhibiting and exploiting additional structure. In particular, this describes the underlying $k \mathbf{FB}$-bimodule of $k \mathbf{FS}^0$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 51 pages, 6 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Positional numeration systems are a large family of numeration systems used to represent natural numbers. Whether the set of all representations forms a regular language or not is one of the most important questions that can be asked of such a system. This question was investigated in a 1998 article by Hollander. Central to his analysis is a property linking positional numeration systems and Rényi numeration systems, which use a real base to represent real numbers. However, this link only exists when the initial numeration system has a dominant root, which is not a necessary condition for regularity. In this article, we show a more general link between positional numeration systems and alternate base numeration systems, a family generalizing Rényi systems. We then take advantage of this link to provide a full characterization of those numeration systems that generate a regular language. We also discuss the effectiveness of our method, and comment Hollander's results and conjecture in the light of ours.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 24 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $Γ\subset PSL_2(\mathbb{R})$ be a Fuchsian group of the first kind which has a cusp $i\infty$ of width one. In this paper, we first consider a generating function formed with the Niebur--Poincaré series $\{F_{m,s}(τ)\}_{m\ge 1}$ associated to $i\infty$. We prove a relation between the continuation of this generating function to $s=1$ with the resolvent kernel associated to the hyperbolic Laplacian and the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series associated to $i\infty$, also at $s=1$. Secondly, we show that, for any $s\in \mathbb{N}$, the generating function equals Poincaré type series involving polylogarithms. We also consider a generating function formed with derivatives in $s$ of the Niebur--Poincaré series and prove that the continuation of the generating function at $s=1$ can be expressed in terms of $Γ$-periodization of a point-pair invariant involving the Rogers dilogarithm and the Kronecker limit function associated to the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 19 pp. Submitted to Inventiones Mathematicae. Rewrote Section 5 starting with anti-cyclotomic ultrafilter U and valued field \prod_U Q_p, so that L:=Abs(\prod_U Q_p) has tor(L^\times)={-1,1} via CRT and Dirichlets' theorem (avoiding FIP for Cebotarev families entirely). The "APRC environment" is established for the remainder of Section 5, facilitating proofs of main results in Section 6

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An ideal setting to exhibit infinite sets of primes $p$ relative to which an integer is a primitive root $\pmod p$ is provided by the ultraproduct ring $\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}=\prod_{\mathfrak{U}} \mathbb{Z}_p$ with respect to a nonprincipal ultrafilter $\mathfrak{U}$ on $\wp(\mathbb{P})$, extant via Tarski's Ultrafilter Theorem and a Chebotarev Density Theorem construction realising $\mathbb{L}\deff\mathbb{M}(\sqrt{-2})$, for a maximal radical-free subfield $\mathbb{M}\subseteq\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ with $\mathbb{L}\cap\mathbb{Q}(μ_{\infty}) = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-2})$, as the relative algebraic closure $\mathrm{Abs}(\widetilde{\mathbb{K}})$ of the prime field of $\widetilde{\mathbb{K}}=\prod_{\mathfrak{U}} \mathbb{F}_p$. Results include positive resolutions of the conjectured infinitude of primes $p$ for which $\bullet$ $\frac{p-1}{2}$ is prime; $\bullet$ a non-perfect-square $-1\neq m\in\mathbb{Z}$ is a primitive root $\pmod p$; establishing as manifest the efficacy of ultraproduct treatments in resolving number theory problems requiring authentication of countably infinite conforming sets.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a Drinfeld presentation for the super-Yangian $\mathrm{Y}(\mathfrak{q}_n)$ associated with the queer Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{q}_n$. The Drinfeld generators of $\mathrm{Y}(\mathfrak{q}_n)$ are obtained through a block Gauss decomposition of the generator matrix in its RTT presentation, and the Drinfeld relations are explicitly computed by utilizing a block version of its RTT relations. As a byproduct, we obtain a new expression for the central series of $\mathrm{Y}(\mathfrak{q}_n)$ in terms of Gauss generators.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Section 2.1 was extended significantly

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study $t$-structures (on triangulated categories) that are closely related to weight structures. A $t$-structure couple $t=(C_{t\le 0},C_{t\ge 0})$ is said to be adjacent to a weight structure $w=(C_{w\le 0}, C_{w\ge 0})$ if $C_{t\ge 0}=C_{w\ge 0}$. For a category $C$ that satisfies the Brown representability property we prove that $t$ that is adjacent to $w$ exists if and only if $w$ is smashing (that is, "respects C-coproducts"). The heart $Ht$ of this $t$ is the category of those functors $Hw^{op}\to Ab$ that respect products (here $Hw$ is the heart of $w$); the result has important applications. We prove several more statements on constructing $t$-structures starting from weight structures; we look for a strictly orthogonal $t$-structure $t$ on some $C'$ (where $C,C'$ are triangulated subcategories of a common $D$) such that $C'_{t\le 0}$ (resp. $C'_{t\ge 0}$) is characterized by the vanishing of morphisms from $C_{w\ge 1}$ (resp. $C_{w\le -1}$). Some of these results generalize properties of semi-orthogonal decompositions proved in the previous paper, and can be applied to various derived categories of (quasi)coherent sheaves on a scheme $X$ that is projective over an affine noetherian one. We also study hearts of orthogonal $t$-structures and their restrictions, and prove some statements on "reconstructing" weight structures from orthogonal $t$-structures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper introduces and systematically studies a class of Weyl-type algebras enriched with hyperbolic sine and power generators over a field of characteristic zero, defined as $A_{p,t,\cA} = \Weyl{\sinh(\pm x^{p} \sinh(t)),\; \sinh(\cA x),\; x^{\cA}}$ in the associative setting and $\Nass{\sinh(\pm x^{p} \sinh(t)),\; \sinh(\cA x),\; x^{\cA}}$ in a non-associative framework. We establish fundamental structural properties, including the triviality of the center for the non-associative version and the explicit description $Z(A_{p,t,\cA}) = \FF[\sinh(\pm x^{p} \sinh(t))]$ for the associative one, proving that $A_{p,t,\cA}$ is an Azumaya algebra over its center and represents a nontrivial class in the Brauer group $\Br(\FF(y))$. Furthermore, we compute the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension for relevant examples and demonstrate its key properties, such as additivity under tensor products and the growth dichotomy. We completely characterize the automorphism group of $A_{p,t,\cA}$ as a semidirect product of a torus with a discrete group, and provide a sharp isomorphism criterion showing that the parameter $t$ is a complete invariant in the family. The paper concludes with two open problems concerning the GK dimension of non-associative hyperbolic sine algebras and the classification of their deformations, pointing toward future research directions in non-associative growth theory and deformation rigidity.</p></details>

We establish a nontrivial power-saving bound of $B(H,N)$ for the range of the shift $H\ge N^{1-\frac{4}{d_1+d_2}+\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon>0$. For the cases $d_1 = d_2 + 1$ and $d_1 = d_2$, our result extends a result that can be derived from a theorem of Friedlander and Iwaniec. In particular, when $d_1 = d_2$, we reach the critical threshold $H\ge N^{1-2/d+\varepsilon}$ such that any further improvement in this range yields a subconvexity bound for the corresponding standard $L$-function in the $t$-aspect.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In [DP12], Delzant and Py showed that there exist continuous irreducible isometric actions of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ on the infinite-dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^\infty$. Such continuous irreducible actions do not exist on the hyperbolic spaces $\mathbb{H}^n$ when $n>2$ and their associated embeddings $\mathbb{H}^2 \to \mathbb{H}^\infty$ given by the orbit maps were later called exotic by Monod and Py in [MP14]. In this article, we produce a continuous and irreducible representation of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})\to \mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^\infty)$ using the hyperbolic model for convex bodies introduced in [DF22]. This yields a convex cocompact $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$-action on the infinite-dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^\infty$, of which the compact quotient over the minimal $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$-invariant convex set is homeomorphic to the 2-dimensional oriented Banach--Mazur compactum. Moreover, we study the geometry of one of its orbit maps and compute the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of this representation.</p></details>

Lin and Zhang extended their result to Glashier's theorem by generalizing $C(n)$. We generalize $D(n)$, prove an analogous partition identity for the $m=3$ case, and provide a new series equal to Glashier's product both in the finite and infinite cases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study very smooth functions on the real line, namely Schwartz functions, that satisfy a finite identity relating their translates and a single modulation. Concretely, we assume there is a nontrivial linear combination of translates of the function that equals a fixed frequency shift of the same function. Passing to the Fourier transform turns this into a multiplicative transfer relation: the value of the Fourier transform at one point is obtained by multiplying its value at another point by a trigonometric polynomial. Iterating this relation expresses the Fourier transform along an arithmetic progression as a product of such trigonometric factors times a fixed initial value. We then recast this product in an ergodic theoretic framework by viewing it as a Birkhoff sum for a continuous observable on a compact abelian group generated by a diagonal unitary matrix. The key quantity controlling the growth or decay of the Fourier transform along the progression is a space average, namely the integral over the compact group of the logarithm of the absolute value of the associated trigonometric polynomial. The main rigorously proved statement is the following. If, for some frequency where the Fourier transform does not vanish along the entire progression, this space average is nonzero, or if the average is zero but a certain recurrence set, in the sense of Atkinson's theorem, intersects a distinguished one-parameter subgroup, then the assumed translation--modulation identity forces exponential growth of the Fourier transform along some sequence of points. This contradicts the rapid decay required of a Schwartz function.</p></details>

Cluster variables of $\mathcal{A}$ correspond to $σ$-orbits of arcs of $\mathbf{S}$, while clusters are given by admissible $σ$-invariant ideal triangulations. We provide a cluster expansion formula for any $σ$-orbit $[γ]$ in terms of perfect matchings of some labeled modified snake graphs constructed from the arcs of $[γ]$. Then, we associate a symmetric finite-dimensional algebra $A$ to any seed of $\mathcal{A}$, such that non-initial cluster variables bijectively correspond to orthogonal indecomposable $A$-modules. Finally, we exhibit a purely representation-theoretic map from the category of orthogonal $A$-modules to $\mathcal{A}$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Bondal-Kapranov's notion of enhanced triangulated categories behaves well in the framework of localization theory, in the sense that the Verdier quotient of triangulated categories can be lifted to the Drinfeld dg quotient of pretriangulated dg categories. In this paper, we develop a parallel enhancement for Nakaoka-Palu's notion of extriangulated categories, which unifies exact and triangulated categories. The enhancement of extriangulated categories was recently initiated by Xiaofa Chen under the name exact dg categories. Moreover, it is known that certain ideal quotients of extriangulated categories remain extriangulated, and that such ideal quotients admit dg enhancements via the dg quotient of the corresponding connective exact dg category. Motivated by Chen's framework of enhanced extriangulated categories, we introduce the concept of a cohomological envelope of an exact dg category and generalize his construction of the enhanced ideal quotient. We show that the dg quotient of exact dg categories, when passing to cohomological envelopes and their substructures -- referred to as exact dg subquotients -- is compatible with a broad class of extriangulated quotients in the sense of Nakaoka-Ogawa-Sakai. To further clarify the scope of our approach, we formulate the notion of an extriangulated subquotient, which enables the localization of any extriangulated category by extension-closed subcategories. This construction encompasses not only ideal and Verdier quotients, but also the quotient of an exact category by a biresolving subcategory. Notably, the extriangulated subquotient admits a natural lifting to the exact dg subquotient.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In arXiv:2407.11958, a moduli stack parametrizing $I$--indexed diagrams of Higgs bundles over a base stack $X$ was constructed for any finite simplicial set $I$, inspiring speculations about extending the non-Abelian Hodge correspondence to these moduli stacks. In the present work, we formalize the de Rham side of this conjectural extension. We construct moduli stacks parametrizing diagrams of bundles with $λ$--connections over a base prestack $X$, where $λ$ can be a fixed number or a parameter. Taking $λ$ to be $1$ gives a moduli stack parametrizing diagrams of bundles with connection, while taking it to be a parameter gives a version of Simpson's non-Abelian Hodge filtration for digrams of bundles with connection. We show that when $X$ is a smooth and projective scheme over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$, these moduli stacks are algebraic and locally of finite presentation, and have affine diagonal.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime number, $n$ an integer $\geq 2$ and $ρ$ an $n$-dimensional automorphic $p$-adic Galois representation (for a compact unitary group) such that $r:=ρ\vert_{\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}_p}/\mathbb{Q}_p)}$ is crystalline. Under a mild assumption on the Frobenius eigenvalues of $D:=D_{\mathrm{cris}}(r)$ and under the usual Taylor-Wiles conditions, we show that the locally analytic representation of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ associated to $ρ$ in the corresponding Hecke eigenspace of the completed $H^0$ contains an explicit finite length subrepresentation which determines and only depends on $r$. This generalizes previous results of the second author which assumed that the Hodge filtration on $D$ was as generic as possible. Our approach provides a much more explicit link to this Hodge filtration (in all cases), which allows to study the internal structure of this finite length locally analytic subrepresentation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We assemble three basic analytic inputs -- the Kuznetsov trace formula on $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ with explicit continuous spectrum, the $\mathrm{GL}_3$ Voronoi formula, and $t$-aspect second-moment bounds for $L(1/2+it,\varphi)$ -- into a single framework for a smoothed $\mathrm{GL}_3$ spectral average. For a fixed Hecke-Maass cusp form $\varphi$ on $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb Z)$, we evaluate a weight-$0$ spectral average of $L(1/2,\varphi\times f_j)$ over the $\mathrm{GL}_2$ Maass spectrum. In the Kuznetsov normalization where the diagonal transform has density $t\tanh(πt)$, the diagonal contributes exactly $2\mathcal H_0[h]$; the off-diagonal and the continuous spectrum are bounded with power savings consistent with the currently best unconditional second-moment bounds in the $\mathrm{GL}_3$ $t$-aspect. The argument is organized into a sequence of steps: normalizations and approximate functional equations, insertion into Kuznetsov, Voronoi summation on $\mathrm{GL}_3$, a bilinear estimate for the off-diagonal, evaluation of the diagonal and the Eisenstein contribution, moment refinements and parameter optimization, and finally plateau-smooth spectral windows and standard generalizations.</p></details>

We obtain finiteness results on these sets for families of modular curves with prime-power level.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Stanley sequences starting from the set $\{0, n\}$ where $n$ is a positive integer have long been conjectured to be divided into two types: the "regular" type where the growth rate is $Θ(n^{\log_2(3)})$, and the "irregular" type where the growth rate is thought to be $Θ(n^2/\log n)$. A paradigmatic case of a candidate irregular type is $n=4$, although to date no value of $n$ has been proven to have such a growth rate. Here, we provide strong numerical evidence against this conjectured growth rate for $n=4$. Specifically, for $n=4$, it seems plausible that the upper bound is $O(n^2/\log n)$ but that the lower bound is in fact $Ω(n^{2-δ})$ for some $δ> 0$. This appears to be because the sequence is not totally "random" as has been assumed. Limitations of the numerical method here is discussed.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by some previously known facts from mathematical and physics literature, we explore certain relations between 3-dimensional topological gauge theories with continuous and finite gauge groups, commonly known as Chern-Simons (CS) and Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories, respectively. Specifically, we consider the continuous and finite gauge groups to be the same algebraic group over the complex numbers and a finite field, respectively. In this paper, we focus on the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ example and consider the relationship on the level of the corresponding partition functions on closed 3-manifolds. Mathematically, these are Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev and DW invariants. We find that the asymptotics of the DW theory when the number of elements of the finite field is large recovers the leading asymptotics of the CS theory at large level when the 3-manifold contains no hyperbolic components. As a byproduct, we develop efficient techniques to count the number of points over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$ of $\mathrm{SL}(2)$ representation varieties of fundamental groups of 3-manifolds, possibly with weights pulled back from a chosen class in $H^3(\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{F}_q),\mathrm{U}(1))$.</p></details>

Further, we provide an explicit computable algorithm to determine the generalized GGP relevant pair, as developed in \cite{Cha_qbl}. In particular, we show that if $π$ and $π'$ are any irreducible smooth representations of $\mathrm{GL_{n+1}(F)}$ and $\mathrm{GL_{n}(F)}$ respectively, and their Langlands data or Zelevinsky data are given in terms of multisegments, then through an algorithmic process we can determine whether the space $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{GL_n(F)}}(π, π')$ is non-zero. Finally, when one of the represntations $π$ and $ π'$ is a generalized Speh representation, we give a complete classification for the other one for which the Hom space is non-zero.</p></details>

For $x>0$ functions are non intersecting and form a dense subset of $(0,1)$. Furthermore, when evaluating the tree for positive rational values, the tree contains every rational in $(0,1)$ exactly once if and only if $x\in \mathbb{N}$. For $x=1$, one finds back the classical Farey tree which is related to regular continued fractions. In the last part, we will make a similar tree in a similar way but for backward continued fractions. We highlight some similarities and differences.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The long root geometry $A_{n,\{1,n\}}(\mathbb{K})$ for the special linear group $\mathrm{SL}(n+1,\mathbb{K})$ admits an embedding in the (projective space of) the vector space of the traceless square matrices of order $n+1$ with entries in the field $\mathbb{K}$, usually regarded as the {\em natural} embedding of $A_{n,\{1,n\}}(\mathbb{K})$. S. Smith and H. Völklein (A geometric presentation for the adjoint module of $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{K})$, {\em J. Algebra}, vol. 127) have proved that the natural embedding of $A_{2,\{1,2\}}(\mathbb{K})$ is relatively universal if and only if $\mathbb{K}$ is either algebraic over its minimal subfield or perfect with positive characteristic. They also give some information on the relatively universal embedding of $A_{2,\{1,2\}}(\mathbb{K})$ which covers the natural one, but that information is not sufficient to exhaustively describe it. The "if" part of Smith-Völklein's result also holds true for any $n$, as proved by Völklein in his investigation of the adjoint modules of Chevalley groups (H. Völklein, On the geometry of the adjoint representation of a Chevalley group, {\em J. Algebra}, vol. 127). In this paper we give an explicit description of the relatively universal embedding of $A_{n,\{1,n\}}(\mathbb{K})$ which covers the natural one. In particular, we prove that this relatively universal embedding has (vector) dimension equal to $\mathfrak{d}+n^2+2n$ where $\mathfrak{d}$ is the transcendence degree of $\mathbb{K}$ over its minimal subfield (if $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{K}) = 0$) or the generating rank of $\mathbb{K}$ over ${\mathbb K}^p$ (if $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{K}) = p > 0$). Accordingly, both the "if" and the "only if" part of Smith-Völklein's result hold true for every $n \geq 2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the present paper, we study the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local fields from the point of view of anabelian geometry. In particular, we show that, under certain mild assumptions, the image of the natural homomorphism from the automorphism group of a mixed-characteristic local field to the outer automorphism group of the associated absolute Galois group is not a normal subgroup. Furthermore, we show that, for the absolute Galois group of a mixed-characteristic local field satisfying certain assumptions, there exist a continuous representation and a continuous automorphism of the group such that the former is irreducible, abelian, and crystalline, but the continuous representation obtained as the composite of the former with the latter is not even Hodge-Tate. These results significantly generalize previous works by Hoshi and Nishio. A key observation in obtaining these results is to focus on the analogy between the mapping class groups of topological surfaces and the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local fields. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first work applying results from the theory of mapping class groups to the anabelian geometry of mixed-characteristic local fields, going beyond a mere analogy between the two.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the derived category of mod-KQ for Dynkin quiver Q, we construct a full subcategory in a canonical way, so that its endomorphism algebra is a higher Auslander algebra of global dimension $3k+2$ for any $k\geq 1$. Furthermore, we extend this construction for higher analogues of representation finite and hereditary algebras. Specifically, if $M$ is an n-cluster tilting object in the bounded derived category of n-representation finite and n-hereditary algebra, then we construct a full subcategory in a canonical way, so that its endomorphism algebra is a higher Auslander algebra of global dimension $(n+2)k+n+1$ for any $k\geq 1$. As an application, we revisit the higher Auslander correspondence. Firstly, we describe the corresponding module categories that have higher cluster-tilting objects, and then we discuss their relationship with certain full subcategories of the derived category. Consequently, we obtain a vast list of n-representation finite n-hereditary algebras whose n-cluster tilting objects are always minimal generator-cogenerator. Moreover, resulting algebras can be realized as endomorphism algebras of certain full subcategories of (higher) cluster categories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Starting from a topological treatment of the Eisenstein class of a torus bundle, we define log-rigid analytic classes for $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$. These are group cohomology classes for $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ valued on log-rigid analytic functions on Drinfeld's $p$-adic symmetric domain. Such classes can be evaluated at points attached to totally real fields of degree $n$ where $p$ is inert. We conjecture that these values are $p$-adic logarithms of Gross--Stark units in the narrow Hilbert class field of totally real fields. We provide evidence for the conjecture by comparing our constructions to $p$-adic $L$-functions. In addition, we prove it in certain situations where the totally real field is Galois over $\mathbb{Q}$, as a consequence of the fact that in this case there is a conjugate of a Gross--Stark unit in $\mathbb{Q}_p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct log-motivic cohomology groups for semistable varieties and study the $p$-adic deformation theory of log-motivic cohomology classes. Our main result is the deformational part of a $p$-adic variational Hodge conjecture for varieties with semistable reduction: a rational log-motivic cohomology class in bidegree $(2n,n)$ lifts to a continuous pro-class if and only if its Hyodo-Kato class lies in the $n$-th step of the Hodge filtration. This generalises a theorem of Bloch-Esnault-Kerz which treats the good reduction case. In the case $n=1$ the lifting criterion is the one obtained by Yamashita for the logarithmic Picard group. Along the way, we relate log-motivic cohomology to logarithmic Milnor $K$-theory and the logarithmic Hyodo-Kato Hodge-Witt sheaves.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper introduces and systematically studies Weyl-type, Witt-type, and non-associative algebras defined over expolynomial rings -- commutative rings generated by exponential functions $e^{αx}$, exponentials of exponentials $e^{\pm x^p e^{t}}$, and power functions $x^α$ for $α$ in an additive subgroup $\cA$ of a characteristic zero field $\FF$. We establish several fundamental structural results: scalar extensions preserve both the algebraic structure and simplicity; intermediate subalgebras associated with subgroups $\ZZ \subseteq \cB \subseteq \cA$ remain simple; the algebra of graded derivations is isomorphic to a semidirect product $\Weyl{e^{\pm x^p e^{t}},\; e^{\cA x},\; x^{\cA}} \rtimes \FF^n$; tensor products over disjoint variable sets decompose naturally into larger algebras; and a complete isomorphism criterion is given, showing that isomorphism depends precisely on the orbit of the parameter $p$ under the automorphism group of $\cA$ and the equality of the deformation parameter $t$. These theorems generalize classical results on Weyl and Witt algebras, provide new families of simple algebras, and offer a foundation for further research in deformation theory, representation theory, and cohomology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a singular filtration on a manifold, e.g. a subriemannian setting, one can understand the elliptic regularity problems through a special kind of calculus. The principal symbol in this calculus involves the unitary representations of a family of graded nilpotent groups. Not all the irreducible representations of these groups have to be taken into account however, the ones that should be considered form the Helffer-Nourrigat cone. This space thus plays the role of a phase space in subriemannian geometry. Its topology is however very singular, preventing any kind of geometry on it. We propose a way to desingularize it. The unitary spectrum of a nilpotent group can be stratified into strata that are locally compact Hausdorff, following Puckansky and Pedersen. We show how this stratification extends to the whole Helffer-Nourrigat cone. As a byproduct, we show that the C*-algebra of principal symbols and the one of pseudodifferential operators of order 0 are solvable with explicit subquotients.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Extended Khovanov arc algebras $\mathrm{K}_m^n$ are graded associative algebras which naturally appear in a variety of contexts, from knot and link homology, low-dimensional topology and topological quantum field theory to representation theory and symplectic geometry. C. Stroppel conjectured in her ICM 2010 address that the bigraded Hochschild cohomology groups of $\mathrm{K}_m^n$ vanish in a certain range, implying that the algebras $\mathrm K_m^n$ admit no nontrivial A$_\infty$ deformations, in particular that the algebras are intrinsically formal. Whereas Stroppel's Conjecture is known to hold for the algebras $\mathrm K_m^1$ and $\mathrm K_1^n$ by work of Seidel and Thomas, we show that $\mathrm K_m^n$ does in fact admit nontrivial A$_\infty$ deformations with nonvanishing higher products for all $m, n \geq 2$. We describe both $\mathrm K_m^n$ and its Koszul dual concretely as path algebras of quivers with relations and give an explicit algebraic construction of A$_\infty$ deformations of $\mathrm K_m^n$ by using the correspondence between A$_\infty$ deformations of a Koszul algebra and filtered associative deformations of its Koszul dual. These deformations can also be viewed as A$_\infty$ deformations of Fukaya--Seidel categories associated to Hilbert schemes of surfaces based on recent work of Mak and Smith.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct an arithmetic period map for cubic fourfolds, in direct analogy with Rizov's work on K3 surfaces. For each $N\geq 1$, we introduce a Deligne-Mumford stack $\widetilde{\mathcal{C}^{[N]}}$ of cubic fourfolds with level structure and prove that the associated period map $j_{N}:\widetilde{\mathcal{C}^{[N]}}_{\mathbb{C}}\to {\rm Sh}_{K_{N}}(L)_{\mathbb{C}}$ is algebraic, étale, and descends to $\mathbb{Q}$ whenever $N$ is coprime to $2310$. As an application, we develop complex multiplication theory for cubic fourfolds and show that every cubic fourfold of CM type is defined over an abelian extension of its reflex field. Moreover, using the CM theory for rank-21 cubic fourfolds, we provide an alternative proof of the modularity of rank-21 cubic fourfolds established by Livné.</p></details>

We derive an explicit formula for ramified orbital integrals, showing they are limits of unramified ones and that Arthur's definition yields a universal object, agreeing with that of Hoffmann-Wakatsuki. Finally, on the spectral side, we apply normalized intertwining operators to present the expansion in a form parallel to that of the geometric side.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a complex number $x$, $\Vert x\Vert:=\min\{|x-m|:m\in\mathbb{Z}\}$. Let $k\geq 1$ be an integer, and $K$ be a number field. Let $α_1,\ldots,α_k$ be algebraic numbers with $|α_i|\geq 1$ and let $d_i$ denotes the degree of $α_i$ for $1\leq i\leq k$. Set $d=d_1+\cdots+d_k$. In this article, we show that if the inequality $ 0<\Vertλ_1 qα^n_1+\cdots+λ_k qα^n_k\Vert<\frac{θ^n}{q^{d+\varepsilon}} $ has infinitely many solutions in $(n, q,λ_1,\ldots,λ_k)\in \mathbb{N}^2\times (K^\times)^k$ with absolute logarithmic Weil height of $λ_i$ is small compared to $n$ and some $θ\in (0,1)$, then, in particular, the tuple $(λ_1 qα^n_1,\ldots, λ_k qα^n_k)$ is pseudo-Pisot, and at least one of $α_i$ is an algebraic integer. This result can be viewed as Roth's type theorem for linear combinations of powers of algebraic numbers over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. The case $q=1$ was recently proved by Kulkarni, Mavraki, and Nguyen \cite{kul}, which is a generalization of Mahler's question proved in \cite{corv}. As a consequence of our result, we obtain the following generalization of this question: let $α>1$ be an algebraic number with $d=[\mathbb{Q}(α):\mathbb{Q}]$. For a given $\varepsilon>0$, if the inequality $$ 0<\Vertλqα^n\Vert<\frac{θ^n}{q^{d+\varepsilon}} $$ has infinitely many solutions in the tuples $(n,q,λ)\in \mathbb{N}^2\times K^\times$ with absolute logarithmic Weil height of $λ$ is small compared to $n$ and $θ\in (0,1)$, then some power of $α$ is a Pisot number. As an application of this result, we deduce the transcendence of certain infinite products of algebraic numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unit-generated orders of a quadratic field are orders of the form $\mathcal{O} = \mathbb{Z}[\varepsilon]$, where $\varepsilon$ is a unit in the quadratic field. If the order $\mathcal{O}$ is a maximal order of a real quadratic field, then the quadratic number field is necessarily of a restricted form, being of narrow Richaud--Degert type. However, every real quadratic field contains infinitely many distinct unit-generated orders. They are parametrized as $\mathcal{O} = \mathcal{O}_{n}^{\pm}$ having quadratic discriminants $Δ(\mathcal{O}) = Δ_{n}^{+} = n^2 - 4$ (for $n \geq 3$) and $Δ(\mathcal{O}) = Δ_{n}^{-} = n^2 + 4$ (for $n \geq 1$). We show the (wide or narrow) class numbers of unit-generated orders satisfy $\log \left|{\rm Cl}(\mathcal{O})\right| \sim \log \frac{1}{2}\left|Δ(\mathcal{O})\right|$ as $\left|Δ(\mathcal{O})\right| \to \infty$, using a result of L.-K. Hua. We deduce that there are finitely many unit-generated quadratic orders of class number one and finitely many unit-generated quadratic orders whose class group is $2$-torsion. We classify all unit-generated real quadratic maximal orders having class number one. We provide numerical lists of quadratic unit-generated orders whose class groups are $2$-torsion for $Δ\leq 10^{10}$, for both wide and narrow class groups, which are conjecturally complete.</p></details>

Strong decorrelation occurs for all positive irrationals, except possibly Liouville numbers.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study the framed rook algebra, a structure that unifies two significant generalizations of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra. The first one, introduced by Solomon, extends the Hecke algebra to the full matrix monoid, yielding the rook monoid algebra. The second one, developed by Yokonuma, replaces the Borel subgroup with the unipotent subgroup, resulting in the Yokonuma-Hecke algebra. Our concrete algebra is constructed from the double cosets of the unipotent subgroup within the full matrix monoid. We show that this double coset decomposition is indexed by the framed symmetric inverse monoid. We also define the Rook Yokonuma-Hecke algebra as an abstract structure using generators and relations. We then prove the main isomorphism theorem, which establishes that this abstract algebra is isomorphic to the framed rook algebra under a specific parameter specialization. To complete our characterization, we provide a faithful representation on a tensor space and establish a linear basis for the Rook Yokonuma-Hecke algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine the spaces of states of the two-dimensional $O(n)$ and $Q$-state Potts models with generic parameters $n,Q\in \mathbb{C}$ as representations of their known symmetry algebras. While the relevant representations of the conformal algebra were recently worked out, it remained to determine the action of the global symmetry groups: the orthogonal group for the $O(n)$ model, and the symmetric group $S_Q$ for the $Q$-state Potts model. We do this by two independent methods. First we compute the twisted torus partition functions of the models at criticality. The twist in question is the insertion of a group element along one cycle of the torus: this breaks modular invariance, but allows the partition function to have a unique decomposition into characters of irreducible representations of the global symmetry group. Our second method reduces the problem to determining branching rules of certain diagram algebras. For the $O(n)$ model, we decompose representations of the Brauer algebra into representations of its unoriented Jones--Temperley--Lieb subalgebra. For the $Q$-state Potts model, we decompose representations of the partition algebra into representations of the appropriate subalgebra. We find explicit expressions for these decompositions as sums over certain sets of diagrams, and over standard Young tableaux. We check that both methods agree in many cases. Moreover, our spaces of states are consistent with recent bootstrap results on four-point functions of the corresponding CFTs.</p></details>

The problem reduces to finding rational sections on a genus-one fibration over $\mathbb{Q}(S)$, which need not admit a section.

In particular, we provide a complete methodology to compute the $p$-adic continued fraction of the Möbius transformation and the bilinear fractional transformation of $p$-adic numbers. These allow any standard arithmetic operation over $p$-adic numbers to be performed. In great contrast with real continued fractions, we prove that the knowledge of arbitrarily many partial quotients of the initial continued fractions is not always sufficient to recover some partial quotients of the transformations.

> **Comment:** V2: typos corrected

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $d\ge3$ and $\mathbb{F}_q^{\,d}$ be the $d$-dimensional vector space over a finite field of order $q$, where $q$ is an odd prime power. Let $X_π$ be the set of lines through the origin intersecting the slice $π\cap S^{d-1}$, where $π=\{x_d=λ\}$ and $S^{d-1}=\{x:\|x\|=1\}$. For $E\subset\mathbb{F}_q^{\,d}$ and $N\ge1$, we study the exceptional sets $$ T_1(X_π,E,N)=\bigl\{V\in X_π:\ |π_V(E)|\le N\bigr\},\qquad T_2(X_π,E,N)=\bigl\{V\in X_π:\ |π_{V^\perp}(E)|\le N\bigr\}, $$ with their respective natural ranges of $N$. Using discrete Fourier analysis together with restriction/extension estimates for cone and sphere-type quadrics over finite fields, we obtain sharp upper bounds (up to constant factors) for $\lvert T_1\rvert$ and $\lvert T_2\rvert$, with separate analyses for the cases $λ\in \{0, \pm 1\}$. The bounds exhibit arithmetic-geometric dichotomies absent in the full Grassmannian: the quadratic character of $λ^{2}-1$ and the parity of $d$ determine the size of the exceptional sets. As an application, when $|E|\ge q$, there exists a positive proportion of elements $\mathbf{y}\in π\cap S^{d-1}$ such that the pinned dot-product sets $\{\mathbf{y}\cdot \mathbf{x}\colon \mathbf{x}\in E\}$ have cardinality $Ω(q)$. We further study analogous families arising from the spheres of radii $0$ and $-1$, and, by combining the results, recover the known estimates for projections over the full Grassmannian, complementing a result of Chen (2018).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish the analogue of Khintchine's theorem for all self-similar probability measures on the real line. When specified to the case of the Hausdorff measure on the middle-thirds Cantor set, the result is already new and provides an answer to an old question of Mahler. The proof consists in showing effective equidistribution in law of expanding upper-triangular random walks on $\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{R})/\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$, a result of independent interest.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 43 pages, 2 figures. Comments welcome! v2: some results generalised, exposition improved

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Reflexive dg categories were introduced by Kuznetsov and Shinder to abstract the duality between bounded and perfect derived categories. In particular this duality relates their Hochschild cohomologies, autoequivalence groups, and semiorthogonal decompositions. We establish reflexivity in a variety of settings including affine schemes, simple-minded collections, chain and cochain dg algebras of topological spaces, Ginzburg dg algebras, and Fukaya categories of cotangent bundles and surfaces as well as the closely related class of graded gentle algebras. Our proofs are based on the interplay of reflexivity with gluings, derived completions, and Koszul duality. In particular we show that for certain (co)connective dg algebras, reflexivity is equivalent to derived completeness.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbb Q$ be an elliptic curve and $p \geq 3$ a prime. The modular curve $X_E^-(p)$ parameterizes elliptic curves with $p$-torsion modules anti-symplectically isomorphic to $E[p]$. The work of Freitas--Naskręcki--Stoll uses the modular method to show that all primitive non-trivial solutions of the Fermat-type equation $x^2 + y^3 = z^p$ give rise to rational points on $X_E^-(p)$ with $E \in \{27a1,54a1,96a1,288a1,864a1,864b1,864c1 \}$. Using a criterion classifying the existence of local points due to the first two authors, we show that, for $E$ any of the curves with conductor 864 and certain primes $p \equiv 19 \pmod{24}$, we have $X_E^-(p)(\mathbb Q_\ell) = \emptyset$. Furthermore, for each $E$ in the list and any $p$, we prove that either $X_E^-(p)$ can be discarded using the same criterion, or it cannot be discarded using purely local information.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1994, Shor introduced his famous quantum algorithm to factor integers and compute discrete logarithms in polynomial time. In 2023, Regev proposed a multi-dimensional version of Shor's algorithm that requires far fewer quantum gates. His algorithm relies on a number-theoretic conjecture on the elements in $(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ that can be written as short products of very small prime numbers. We prove a version of this conjecture using tools from analytic number theory such as zero-density estimates. As a result, we obtain an unconditional proof of correctness of this improved quantum algorithm and of subsequent variants.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $C/\mathbb{Q}_p$ a complete algebraically closed field, we construct a collection of non-isomorphic rank two $\mathbb{Q}_p$-local systems on $\mathbb{P}^1_C$ indexed by $C$. This implies that the de Jong fundamental group $π_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^1_C)$ depends on $C$ and, if $C$ has cardinality $>2^{\mathbb{N}}$, that $π_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^1_C)$ is not topologically countably generated. The argument in fact applies to any connected rigid analytic variety over $C$ with a non-constant function to $\mathbb{P}^1_C$.</p></details>
