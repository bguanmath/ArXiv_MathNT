### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09132v3'>2501.09132</a>\]&nbsp; **On the additive image of 0th persistent homology**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ulrich Bauer, Magnus Bakke Botnan, Steffen Oppermann, Johan Steen &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $X$ a finite category and $F$ a finite field, we study the additive image of the functor $\mathrm{H}_0(-,F) \colon \mathrm{rep}(X, \mathbf{Top}) \to \mathrm{rep}(X, \mathbf{Vect}_F)$, or equivalently, of the free functor $\mathrm{rep}(X, \mathbf{Set}) \to \mathrm{rep}(X, \mathbf{Vect}_F)$. We characterize all finite categories $X$ for which the indecomposables in the additive image coincide with the indecomposable indicator representations and provide examples of quivers of wild representation type where the additive image contains only finitely many indecomposables. Motivated by questions in topological data analysis, we conduct a detailed analysis of the additive image for finite grids. In particular, we show that for grids of infinite representation type, there exist infinitely many indecomposables both within and outside the additive image. We develop an algorithm for determining if a representation of a finite category is in the additive image. In addition, we investigate conditions for realizability and the effect of modifications of the source category and the underlying field. The paper concludes with a discussion of the additive image of $\mathrm{H}_n(-,F)$ for an arbitrary field $F$, extending previous work for prime fields.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09264v2'>2503.09264</a>\]&nbsp; **On the Bogomolov-Positselski Conjecture**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Julian Feuerpfeil &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime. An oriented pro-$p$ group $(G,θ)$ is said to have the Bogomolov--Positselski property if it is Kummerian and if $I_θ(G)$ is a free pro-$p$ group. In this paper, we provide a new criterion for an oriented pro-$p$ group to satisfy the Bogomolov--Positselski property. This criterion builds on earlier work of Positselski (arXiv:1405.0965) and Quadrelli--Weigel (arXiv:2103.12438), relates their approaches, and answers a question raised in (arXiv:2103.12438). Under additional assumptions, we obtain two further sufficient criteria. The first is analogous to a Merkurjev--Suslin type statement. The second allows one to weaken the hypotheses appearing in Positselski's criterion (arXiv:1405.0965 Theorem 2). Finally, we show that the stronger conditions are satisfied by pro-$p$ groups of elementary type. As a consequence, the Elementary Type Conjecture implies Positselski's ``Module Koszulity Conjecture 1'' (arXiv:1008.0095) for fields with finitely generated maximal pro-$p$ Galois group.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 74 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define fully exact module categories, a subclass of exact module categories over a finite braided tensor category that is stable under the relative Deligne product. In contrast, we demonstrate with examples in both zero and non-zero characteristic of the base field that the class of exact module categories is not stable under this product. We also observe in examples that fully exact module categories form a dense subset in the class of exact ones. The monoidal 2-category of fully exact module categories strictly contains those of invertible and separable module categories. In fact, we show that each internal algebra of a fully exact module category is projectively separable, a generalization of separable algebras involving projective objects. In the semisimple case, a module category is fully exact if and only if it is separable. In general, fully exact module categories are not dualizable inside their class, but if they are, they are fully dualizable objects in the monoidal 2-category of finite module categories. We call such module categories perfect. We show that perfect module categories form a rigid monoidal 2-subcategory containing all fully dualizable objects. Therefore, we propose perfect module categories as a model for finite tensor 2-categories. If the braiding is symmetric, a module category is fully exact if and only if it is perfect. As a detailed example, we classify fully exact, and hence perfect, module categories over the symmetric tensor category of modules over Sweedler's four-dimensional Hopf algebra and compute their relative Deligne products, and the categories of 1-morphisms. For a general quasi-triangular Hopf algebra, we analyze when the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces is fully exact. We show that this is not the case for both Sweedler's Hopf algebra and Lusztig's factorizable small quantum group of type $A_1$ at an odd root of unity.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Agnieszka Bodzenta, Alexey Bondal &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we present criteria in terms of dual pairs of exceptional sequences for an abelian category to be highest weight. The criteria are applied in three situations of geometric origin. We give new proofs for the facts that the category of perverse sheaves of middle perversity on complex-analytic manifolds with suitable conditions on the stratification is highest weight and that the derived coherent category of any Grassmannian has a $t$-structure with highest weight heart. Also we show that the abelian null category of any proper birational morphism of regular surfaces is highest weight. For this null category, we give a geometric description of some special objects related to the highest weight structure, such as standard, costandard and characteristic tilting objects.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper develops precise asymptotic formulas for expanding non-spherical averages on compact quotients of real rank-one Lie groups, focusing on $SO(n,1)$ as a model case. Using tools from harmonic analysis and representation theory, the study reduces the analysis of orbit averages to an ordinary (ODE) derived from the action of the Casimir operator.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** José L. Cereceda &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.HO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 6 pages; corrects some minor misprints in the published version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For integers $n,k \geq 1$, let $S_k(n)$ denote the power sum $1^k +2^k + \cdots + n^k$. In this note, we first recall the minimal recurrence relation connecting $S_k(n)$ and $S_{k-1}(n)$ established by Abramovich (1973). We then discuss an old algorithm to determine the coefficients of the power sum polynomial $S_k(n)$ in terms of the coefficients of $S_{k-1}(n)$ (see, e.g., Bloom (1993) and Owens (1992)). Moreover, we bring to light an explicit relationship between $S_k(n)$ and $S_{k+1}(n)$ put forward by Budin and Cantor (1972). We conclude that these procedures (including the integration formula expressing $S_k(n)$ in terms of $S_{k-1}(n)$) all constitute equivalent methods to determine $S_k(n)$ starting from $S_{k-1}(n)$. In addition, as a by-product, we provide a determinantal formula for the Bernoulli numbers involving the binomial coefficients.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Harry Spencer &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 18 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a curve $C$ over a number field $K$ equipped with the action of a finite group $G$ by $K$-automorphisms, one obtains a factorisation of $L(C,s)$ into a product of $L$-functions of `motivic pieces of curves' associated to irreducible $G$-representations. We describe an algorithm for explicitly computing values of these $L$-functions, demonstrating implementations in the cases of certain curves with actions by $C_3$, $C_4$ and $D_{10}$. We explain how this algorithm can be used to factor $L$-functions of curves with endomorphisms of Hecke type. Towards applications, we explicitly formulate and numerically verify a version of Deligne's Period Conjecture for hitherto-uninvestigated $L$-functions arising from motivic pieces of superelliptic curves.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 14 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We extend Mullin's prime-generating procedures to produce sequences of primes lying in given residue classes. In particular we study the sequences generated by cyclotomic polynomials $Φ_m(cx)$ for suitable $c\in\mathbb{Z}$. Under the Extended Riemann Hypothesis in general and unconditionally for some moduli, we show that the analogue of the second Euclid--Mullin sequence omits infinitely many primes $\equiv1\pmod{m}$. We further show unconditionally that at least one prime is omitted for infinitely many $m$. This generalises work of the first author for $m=1$ and the second author for $m=2^k$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 27 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the synchronization zeta function associated with a pair of self-maps of a topological space and investigate its properties. We also define the growth rate of synchronization points and derive an explicit formula in the setting of endomorphisms of compact, connected Abelian groups. In addition, we establish Gauss congruences and describe the asymptotic behavior for the sequence of numbers of synchronization points, under the assumption that the synchronization zeta function is rational. Further, we discuss connections with topological entropy and Reidemeister torsion.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the birational geometry of the Kummer surfaces associated to the Jacobian varieties of genus two curves, with a particular focus on fields of characteristic two. In order to do so, we explicitly compute a projective embedding of the Jacobian of a general genus two curve and, from this, we construct its associated Kummer surface. This explicit construction produces a model for desingularised Kummer surfaces over any field of characteristic not two, and specialising these equations to characteristic two provides a model of a partial desingularisation. Adapting the classic description of the Picard lattice in terms of tropes, we also describe how to explicitly find completely desingularised models of Kummer surfaces whenever the $p$-rank is not zero. In the final section of this paper, we compute an example of a Kummer surface with everywhere good reduction over a quadratic number field, and draw connections between the models we computed and a criterion that determines when a Kummer surface has good reduction at two.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Dražen Adamović, Boris Feigin, Shigenori Nakatsuka &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 35 pages, comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the center of the affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{n|1}$ at the critical level is generated by the coefficients in the expansion of the pseudo-differential operator $(\partial_z-u_1(z))\cdots (\partial_z-u_n(z))(\partial_z+u_{n+1}(z))^{-1}$ taking values in the Cartan subalgebra. This is an affine analogue of the Harish-Chandra isomorphism in the finite case. The key ingredient of the proof is the identification of the center with the Heisenberg coset of the regular W-superalgebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_{n|1}$ at the critical level, whose associated graded algebra is realized as the affine supersymmetric polynomials. Based on this, we derive a character formula for the center, which coincides with the generating function of plane partitions with a pit condition. We also prove that the Heisenberg coset at generic levels has a similar interpretation in terms of pseudo-differential operators that deform the one at the critical level.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The aim of this short research note is to present some results about a conjecture of Barker and Gelvin claiming that any source algebra of a block of a finite group has the unit group containing a basis stabilised by the left and right actions of the defect group. We obtain some reduction theorems for the existence of stable unital basis in source algebras of block algebras. Along the way we investigate this problem for the blocks of some finite simple groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish that every set of $k=10$ natural numbers determines at least $30$ distinct pairwise sums or at least $30$ distinct pairwise products, as well as the analogous result for $k=11$ and at least $34$ sums/products, with sharpness uniquely (up to scaling) exhibited by $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18\}$ and $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24\}$, respectively. This extends previous work of the fifth author with Clevenger, Havard, Heard, Lott, and Wilson, which established the corresponding thresholds for $k\leq 9$. Included is a classification result for sets of $10$ real numbers (resp. positive real numbers) determining at most $29$ pairwise sums (resp. pairwise products) that do not contain $8$ elements of any single arithmetic progression (resp. geometric progression), as well as some observations controlling additive quadruples in small subsets of two-dimensional generalized geometric progressions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 29 pages, v2: generalized results in Section 2.2, added Example 1.4. To appear in Compositio Mathematica

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is concerned with local cohomology sheaves on generalized flag varieties supported in closed Schubert varieties, which carry natural structures as (mixed Hodge) D-modules. We employ Kazhdan--Lusztig theory and Saito's theory of mixed Hodge modules to describe a general strategy to calculate the simple composition factors, Hodge filtration, and weight filtration on these modules. Our main tool is the Grothendieck--Cousin complex, introduced by Kempf, which allows us to relate the local cohomology modules in question to parabolic Verma modules over the corresponding Lie algebra. We show that this complex underlies a complex of mixed Hodge modules, and is thus endowed with Hodge and weight filtrations. As a consequence, strictness implies that computing cohomology commutes with taking associated graded with respect to both of these filtrations. We execute this strategy to calculate the composition factors and weight filtration for Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian, in particular showing that the weight filtration is controlled by the augmented Dyck patterns of Raicu--Weyman. As an application, upon restriction to the opposite big cell, we recover the simple composition factors and weight filtration on local cohomology with support in generic determinantal varieties.</p></details>

This work includes the equivalent definitions of spherically complete spaces, their basic properties, examples and non-examples such as the field $\mathbf{C}_p$ of $p$-adic complex numbers. As applications, we formalize the Birkhoff-James orthogonality, Hahn-Banach extension theorem and the spherical completion for non-archimedean Banach spaces.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>One of the starting points of this work was the duality of Borcea relating standard level $k$ representations of $A_1^{(1)}$ and level $2k+1$ of $A_2^{(2)}$. For $k=1$ the combinatorial bases in both cases yield the two Capparelli identities and we wanted to see if there is a correspondence between the bases in terms of partitions for all $k\in\mathbb N$. By using the vertex operator relations in the principal picture for level $5$ standard $A_2^{(2)}$-modules we reduce a spanning set of Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt-type vectors in $L(5Λ_0)$ by removing the leading terms of relations and rendering a list of 34 ``difference'' conditions for partitions.We have with computer programs sorted out the sets of partitions satisfying these conditions and formed the partial generating series which agrees with the principally specialized character for all powers of $q$ up to $41$. Although our list of leading terms is incomplete, our results show that the corresponding combinatorial identity for $L_{A_2^{(2)}}(5Λ_0)$ drastically differs from the one for the Borcea dual $L_{A_1^{(1)}}(2Λ_0)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the relation between end-to-end equivariance and layerwise equivariance in deep neural networks. We prove the following: For a network whose end-to-end function is equivariant with respect to group actions on the input and output spaces, there is a parameter choice yielding the same end-to-end function such that its layers are equivariant with respect to some group actions on the latent spaces. Our result assumes that the parameters of the model are identifiable in an appropriate sense. This identifiability property has been established in the literature for a large class of networks, to which our results apply immediately, while it is conjectural for others. The theory we develop is grounded in an abstract formalism, and is therefore architecture-agnostic.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop (quantum) cluster algebra structures over arbitrary commutative unital rings $\Bbbk$ and prove that the (quantized) coordinate rings of connected simply-connected complex simple algebraic groups $G$ over $\Bbbk$ admit such structures. We first show that the integral form of the quantized coordinate ring of $G$ admits an upper quantum cluster algebra structure over $\mathbb{A}=\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm\frac{1}{2}}]$ by using a combination of tools from quantum groups, canonical bases and cluster algebras and a previous result of the second and third authors over $\mathbb{Q}(q^{\frac{1}{2}})$. We then obtain (integral) quantum versions of recent results of the first author: when $G$ is not of type $F_4$, the quantized coordinate ring of $G$ admits a quantum cluster algebra structure over $\mathbb{A}'$, where $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{A}$ when $G$ is not of types $G_2$, $E_8$, and $F_4$; $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{A}[(q^2+1)^{-1}]$ when $G$ is of type $G_2$, and $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{Q}(q^{\frac{1}{2}})$ when $G$ is of type $E_8$. We furthermore prove that the classical versions of these results hold over $\mathbb{A}'$ (where $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{Z}$ if $G$ is not of type $F_4$ or $G_2$ and $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{2}]$ if $G$ is of type $G_2$) and that the integral form of the coordinate ring of $G$ of type $F_4$ is an upper cluster algebra. Finally, by using common triangular bases of (quantum) cluster algebras, we prove that the above results also hold under specializations of $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{A}'$ to commutative unital rings $\Bbbk$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The demand to know the structure of functionally independent invariants of tensor fields arises in many problems of theoretical and mathematical physics, for instance for the construction of interacting higher-order tensor field actions. In mathematical terms the problem can be formulated as follows. Given a semi-simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ and a $\mathfrak g$-module $V$, one may ask about the structure of the sub-ring of $\mathfrak g$-invariants inside the ring freely generated by the module. We point out how some information about the ring of invariants may be obtained by studying an extended Lie algebra. Numerous examples are given, with particular focus on the difficult problem of classifying invariants of a self-dual 5-form in 10 dimensions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ and a nontrivial element $σ$ of its Shafarevich--Tate group, we introduce the Visualization category $\mathcal{V}(E; σ)$ of abelian varieties that ``visualize'' $σ$ in the sense of Mazur, and we study minimal objects in this category. In particular, we show that there can be several minimal visualizing abelian varieties of different dimensions, answering a question of Mazur. In the case that $σ$ has order $2$ or $3$, we revisit two constructions of visualizing abelian varieties, due to Agashe and Stein, and Cremona and Mazur. We show that the Agashe--Stein construction always yields minimal visualizations for these orders. We also build upon the Cremona--Mazur construction and show how it can be made totally explicit. While the Cremona--Mazur construction can produce non-minimal objects, an appropriate choice in the construction for order $2$ elements $σ$ yields an explicit genus $2$ curve whose Jacobian is a minimal visualization. For order $3$ elements we apply our algorithmic construction to Fisher's database of such elements, and obtain computational evidence that, in the majority of cases, the Cremona--Mazur construction yields a minimal visualization.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 49 pages; The exposition has been improved. Several inaccuracies corrected. Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a revised notion of depth for Langlands parameters for tori defined over a nonarchimedean local field \(F\) that restores depth preservation under the local Langlands correspondence (LLC). We leverage that preservation to derive structural results that, taken together, yield a canonical transfer of broad harmonic-analytic results from characteristic \(0\) to characteristic \(p\). When \(F\) has suitably large positive characteristic, we prove a block-by-block equivalence: each Bernstein block of \(G(F)\) is equivalent to a corresponding block for some \(G'(F')\) with \(F'\) of characteristic \(0\) \(\ell\)-close to \(F\); using this, we show that a LLC in characteristic \(0\) corresponds canonically to a LLC in characteristic \(p\). For regular supercuspidals we give a direct, more structured construction via Kaletha. Along the way we recover and extend results on \(\ell\)-close fields -- introducing a depth-transfer function generalizing the normalized Hasse--Herbrand function, proving truncated isomorphisms for arbitrary tori and parahorics, establishing a depth and supercuspidality preserving Kazhdan-type Hecke-algebra isomorphism for arbitrary maximal parahorics of arbitrary connected reductive groups; and a generalized Cartan decomposition for arbitrary maximal parahorics -- thereby subsuming several earlier results in the literature. Collectively, the results let one work in characteristic \(0\) without loss of generality for a wide swath of harmonic analysis on \(p\)-adic groups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 36 pages, 11 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There are two objectives to this work: to classify all tame integer tilings and to classify all tame integer hypertilings. Motivation for the first objective comes from Conway and Coxeter's modelling of positive integer friezes using triangulated polygons, which has received significant attention since the discovery of cluster algebras by Fomin and Zelevinsky in 2002. Assem, Reutenauer, and Smith introduced $\text{SL}_2$-tilings as generalisations of friezes, and Bessenrodt, Holm, and Jørgensen classified positive integer $\text{SL}_2$-tilings using infinite triangulated polygons. Here we consider $N$-tilings, of which $\text{SL}_2$-tilings are the case $N=1$. We provide a geometric model for all tame integer $N$-tilings using a generalisation of the Farey graph in the hyperbolic plane. Highlights of this model include classifications of all positive integer $N$-tilings and of all quiddity sequences of positive rational friezes using triangulated polygons. The second objective is motivated by Bhargava's celebrated study of binary quadratic forms using integer cubes and by an observation of Demonet et al.\ that there is essentially only one three-dimensional positive integer tiling with $\text{SL}_2$ cross sections. We consider a richer class of three-dimensional tilings, which we call hypertilings, using the Cayley hyperdeterminant. We classify all tame integer hypertilings using generalised Farey graphs; remarkably, those with Cayley hyperdeterminant 1 prove to have a simple description in terms of triple Hadamard products of integer pairs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop and numerically analyze an algebraic-geometric framework for spin-adapted coupled-cluster (CC) theory. Since the electronic Hamiltonian is SU(2)-invariant, physically relevant quantum states lie in the spin singlet sector. We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Craig, van Ittersum, and Ono conjectured that every prime-detecting quasimodular form of level $1$ is a quasimodular Eisenstein series. This conjecture was proved by Kane--Krishnamoorthy--Lau and by van Ittersum--Mauth--Ono--Singh independently. However, in higher levels, prime-detecting quasimodular forms need not be Eisenstein. Recently, Kane, Krishnamoorthy, and Lau formulated a natural higher level analogue of the above conjecture and proved it by analytic methods. In a similar direction, but via an alternative approach based on the independence of characters of $\ell$-adic Galois representations, we prove that any prime-detecting quasimodular form on $Γ_{0}(N)$ belongs to the direct sum of the spaces of quasimodular Eisenstein series and quasimodular oldforms. Moreover, for a quasimodular form $f$ that is not prime-detecting, we give an upper bound for the number of primes $p$ less than $X$ for which the $p$-th Fourier coefficient of a quasimodular form vanishes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbf{G}=\mathrm{U}(2,n)$ be the unitary group associated to a Hermitian space over a quadratic imaginary number field $E$. We assume that 2 is unramified in $E$, and the Hermitian space splits at all finite places and has signature $(2,n)$, where $n\equiv 2 \mathrm{mod} 4$. A theory of Fourier expansions of quaternionic modular forms on $\mathbf{G}$ is developed by Hilado, McGlade, and Yan. In this paper, we define a family of degenerate Heisenberg Eisenstein series $E_{\ell}$ for $\ell>n$ on $\mathbf{G}$, which is a weight $\ell$ quaternionic modular form, and we explicitly compute their Fourier expansions. We prove that the Fourier coefficients of $E_{\ell}$ are rational in a certain sense, and that their denominators are uniformly bounded by an integer depending only on $\ell,n$, and $E$. This provides the first family of quaternionic Eisenstein series whose Fourier coefficients are known to be rational or algebraic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Tsetlin library is a random shuffling process on permutations of $n$ letters, where each letter $i$ can be interpreted as a book; book $i$ is brought to the front of the bookshelf with an assigned probability $x_i$. We define a $q$-deformation of the Tsetlin library by replacing the symmetric group action on permutations by the action of the type $A$ Iwahori-Hecke algebra. We compute the stationary distribution and spectrum of this Markov chain by relating it to a Markov chain on complete flags over the finite field vector space $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ and applying techniques from semigroup theory. We also generalize the $q$-Tsetlin library to words (with repeated letters), and compute its stationary distribution and spectrum.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 40 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop vanishing and cuspidality criteria for quaternionic modular forms on $G=\mathrm{Spin}(4,4)$ using a theory of scalar Fourier coefficients. By analyzing a Fourier-Jacobi expansion for these forms, we prove that a level one quaternionic modular form on $G$ vanishes if and only if its primitive Fourier coefficients are zero. Using this criterion, we characterize Pollack's quaternionic Saito-Kurokawa subspace by imposing a system of linear relation among certain primitive Fourier coefficients. This characterization strengthens earlier work of the author with Johnson-Leung, Negrini, Pollack, and Roy. We also study quaternionic modular forms in the more general setting of a group $G_J$ associated to a cubic norm structure $J$. Here we establish a new relationship between the degenerate Fourier coefficients of quaternionic modular forms, and the Fourier coefficients of the holomorphic modular forms associated to their constant terms. As a consequence, we prove that in weights $\ell\geq 5$, a level one quaternionic modular form on $G$ is cuspidal if and only if its non-degenerate Fourier coefficients satisfy a polynomial growth condition.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1963, Edward Spence published a proof of the following With $φ$ being Euler totient function, if $n>1$ is an integer, and if \begin{equation*} 0<a_1<\cdots<a_{φ(n)}<n, \end{equation*} are the positive integers less than $n$, coprime with $n$, then \begin{equation*} \sum_{j=1}^{φ(n)}ja_j = \frac{φ(n)}{24}\left(8nφ(n)+6n+2φ(m)(-1)^{ω(m)}-2^{ω(m)}\right), \end{equation*} where $m$ is the square-free part of $n$ and $ω(m)$ is the number of prime factors of $m$. Spence's proof relies on an ingenious observation considering Nagell's totient function. Later in 1971, Lucien Van Hamme provided an alternative proof of the result using Fourier analysis and previous work from Hubert Delange in 1968. In this paper I propose another proof of the formula using the reciprocity law for Dedekind sums. If the formula is of interest on its own, it also plays a role in the analysis of the distribution of the $a_j$ as suggested by the work from Hubert Delange.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is devoted to the quantum integrable structure of Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models, formed by an infinite number of commuting Integrals of Motion (IMs) in their current algebra. Focusing for simplicity on the SU(2) case, we obtain the first four commuting higher-spin local IMs, starting from a general SU(2)-invariant ansatz and imposing their commutativity. We further show evidence of their commutativity with quantum non-local IMs, which were already built in the literature as Kondo defects. We then investigate the diagonalization of these local operators on $\widehat{\mathfrak{su}(2)}_k$ Verma modules: we explicitly find the first few eigenvectors and further discuss the affine Bethe ansatz and ODE/IQFT conjectures, which predict the full eigenstates and spectrum of the integrable structure. Our results show a perfect match between the direct diagonalization and these overarching conjectures. We conclude by discussing several outlooks, including multi-current generalisations, massive deformations and a general long-term program towards the first principle quantisation of 2-dimensional integrable sigma-models.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of geometric purity in rigidly-compactly generated tt-categories by considering exact triangles that are pure at each tt-stalk. We develop a systematic study of this concept, including examples and applications. In particular, we show that geometric purity is, in general, strictly stronger than ordinary purity, and that it naturally leads to the notion of geometrically pure-injective objects. We prove that such objects arise as pushforwards of pure-injective objects from suitable tt-stalks. Moreover, we give a detailed analysis of indecomposable geometrically pure-injective objects in the derived category of the projective line. Under mild additional assumptions, we identify the geometric part of the Ziegler spectrum as a closed subset. As an application, we demonstrate that this new notion of purity can be used to tackle the problem of spatiality of the frame of smashing ideals via the geometric Ziegler spectrum. In particular, we show that our approach rules out the counterexamples of Balchin and Stevenson to existing methods.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a prime $p$ and a commutative ring $R$ with unity, let $W(R)$ denote the group of $p$-typical Witt vectors. The group $W(R)$ is endowed with a Verschiebung operator $V: W(R)\to W(R)$ and a Teichmüller map $\langle \ \rangle: R\rightarrow W(R)$. One of the properties satisfied by $V, \langle \ \rangle$ is that the map $R \to W(R)$ given by $x\mapsto V\langle x^p \rangle - p\langle x \rangle$ is an additive map. In this paper we show that for $p\neq 2$, this property essentially characterises the functor $W$. Unlike other characterisations, this is a group-theoretic characterisation, in the sense that it does not use the ring structure of $W(R)$. Most constructions of the group of $p$-typical Witt vectors of non-commutative rings do not have a ring structure, and hence the above characterisation is more suitable for generalisation to the non-commutative setup.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a prime $p$ and an associative ring $R$ with unity, there are various constructions of $p$-typical Witt vectors of $R$, all of which specialize to the classical $p$-typical Witt vectors when $R$ is commutative. These constructions are endowed with a Verschiebung operator $V$ and a Teichmüller map $\langle \cdot \rangle$, and they satisfy the property that the map $x \mapsto V\langle x^p\rangle - p\langle x \rangle$ is additive. In this paper, we adapt the group-theoretic universal characterization of classical $p$-typical Witt vectors proposed in arXiv:2405.12680 to the non-commutative setting. Our main result is that this approach yields a construction of Witt vectors for associative rings, denoted $E$, which specializes correctly to the classical Witt functor in the commutative case. The construction of $E$ is inspired by the Witt functor of Cuntz--Deninger, and we show that $E$ is a universal pre-Witt functor, subject to an explicit conjecture concerning non-commutative polynomials. We further introduce the notion of a Witt functor and construct a universal Witt functor $\hat{E}$, which is closely related to Hesselholt's Witt functor $W_H$. We suspect that $W_H$ is, in fact, the universal Morita-invariant Witt functor.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Conformal field theory and its axiomatisation in terms of vertex operator algebras or chiral algebras are most commonly considered on the Riemann sphere. However, an important constraint in physics and an interesting source of mathematics is the fact that conformal field theories are expected to be well defined on any Riemann surface. To this end, a thorough understanding of chiral torus 1-point functions, ideally including explicit formulae, is a prerequisite for a detailed understanding of higher genera. These are distinguished from characters or vacuum torus 1-point functions because the insertion point is explicitly allowed to be labelled by any module over the vertex operator algebra rather than just the vertex operator algebra itself. Compellingly, chiral torus 1-point functions exhibit interesting modular properties, which we explore here in the example of the simple affine $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ vertex operator algebras at non-negative integral levels. We determine the dimension of the space spanned by such functions, choose a natural basis to construct vector-valued modular forms and describe the congruence properties of these forms. In particular, we find explicit generators for the spaces of all vector-valued modular forms of dimension at most three, when the insertion comes from a simple module other than the vertex operator algebra. Finally, we use the fact that categories of modules over rational vertex operator algebras are modular tensor categories to give explicit formulae for the action of the modular group on chiral torus 1-point functions entirely in terms of categorical data. The usual modular $\mathsf{S}$ and $\mathsf{T}$ matrices of characters are known not to be complete invariants of modular tensor categories, so these generalised modular data are good candidates for more fine-grained invariants.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate integers whose base $g$ expansion omits a fixed digit and which can be represented as a sum of two prime squares. In the first part of the paper, we apply the Hardy--Littlewood circle method to obtain asymptotic formulas for weighted count of representations of such integers up to $g^k$ as $k\to\infty$, where we weight by the von Mangoldt function. In this case, we also get an interesting bias depending on the fixed digit we are missing. In the second part, combining the circle method with sieve methods, we study the second moment of the corresponding unweighted counting function. This allows us to get a nontrivial lower bound for the cardinality of the set $$\{ n \leq g^k : n \text{ omits the digit } b \text{ in its base } g \text{ expansion and } n = p^2 + q^2 \text{ for some primes } p,q \}. $$</p></details>

From a group-theoretic perspective, we first show that the conjecture can be reduced to the case of certain distinguished classes of $p$-adic analytic groups and $\mathbb{F}_{p}[[T]]$-adic analytic groups. Specifically, these are open subgroups of the groups of integral points of absolutely simple algebraic groups defined over non-Archimedean local fields. Furthermore, we provide a group-theoretic interpretation of the conjecture in terms of the virtually Golod-Shafarevich property. Finally, we establish a local-global principle and a prime-to-adjoint principle for the conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Several important families of orthogonal polynomials on the real line are called ``hypergeometric'' since they can be explicitly described in terms of some hypergeometric series $_pF_q$ that uses the degree $n$ of the polynomial as a parameter. It is natural to ask if one can classify all such families. Indeed many classification results have been obtained in this direction, but only under the additional assumption that the polynomials are eigenfunctions of some second order operator. In this paper we initiate a new approach to this classification. We propose a definition of an HG family that makes precise, but also generalizes, the notion of a ``hypergeometric'' family. Our main result is that there are exactly 10 types of orthogonal HG families, 8 from the well-known Askey scheme and 2 additional types of families that can be expressed in terms of Lommel polynomials. Our methods in this paper are algebraic. In particular, we classify a wider class of quasi-orthogonal HG families, and this classification is valid over an arbitrary field of characteristic zero. We also define a more general class of rational HG families and prove a structure theorem for quasi-orthogonal families in this class. We provide examples for such families, that are in particular new families of orthogonal polynomials of potential interest.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms of cluster algebras and show that their induced action on the g-vectors can be realized by tropicalising their action on the homogeneous $\hat{y}$ (or $\mathcal{X}$) variables of a chosen initial cluster. This perspective allows us to interpret the action on g-vectors as a change of coordinates in the tropical setting. Focusing on Grassmannian cluster algebras, we analyse tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms in detail. We derive tropical analogues of the braid group action and the twist map on both g-vectors and tableaux. We introduce the notions of unstable and stable fixed points for quasi-automorphisms, which prove useful for constructing cluster monomials and non-real modules, respectively. As an application, we demonstrate that the counts of prime non-real tableaux with a fixed number of columns in $\mathrm{SSYT}(3, [9])$ and $\mathrm{SSYT}(4, [8])$, arising from the braid group action on stable fixed points, are governed by Euler's totient function. Furthermore, we apply our findings to scattering amplitudes in physics, providing a novel interpretation of the square root associated with the four-mass box integral via stable fixed points of quasi-automorphisms of the Grassmannian cluster algebra $\CC[\Gr(4,8)]$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is well known that there is a somewhat mysterious relation between the area of the quartic Fermat curve $x^4+y^4=1$, aka squircle, and the arc length of the lemniscate $(x^2+y^2)^2=x^2-y^2$. The standardproof of this fact uses relations between elliptic integrals and the gamma function. In this article we generalize this result to relate areas of sectors of the squircle to arc lengths of segments of the lemniscate. We provide a geometric interpretation of this relation and an elementary proof of the relation, which only uses basic integral calculus. We also discuss an alternate version of this kind of relation, which is implicit in a calculation of Siegel.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper discusses what the dimension data of irreducible representations of a finite group looks like in some specific cases, including unipotent and reductive groups over finite fields. The essence of our investigation is whether the dimension data of irreducible representations of a finite group can be ``geometerized'', to become equal to the cardinality of certain orbit spaces. The first part of this paper deals with nilpotent and reductive groups over finite fields, whereas the second part deals with the symmetric group $S_n$. The main conclusion that we want to bring out to contrast these two cases is that for reductive groups over finite fields, the dimension data is concentrated (in a statistical sense) in a neighborhood of the maximal dimension, whereas for the symmetric group, it is spread out.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a number field with algebraic closure $\overline{K}$ and let $S$ be a finite set of places of $K$ containing all the archimedean places. It is known from Silverman's result that a forward orbit of a rational map $\varphi$ contains finitely many $S$-integers in the number field K when $\varphi^2$ is not a polynomial. Sookdeo stated an analogous conjecture for the backward orbits of a rational map $\varphi$ using a general $S$-integrality notion based on the Galois conjugates of points. He proved his conjecture for the power map $\varphi(z) =z^d$ for $d \geq 2$ and consequently for Chebyshev maps (J. Number Theory 131 (2011), 1229-1239). In this paper, we establish uniform bounds on the number of $S$-integral points in the backward orbits of any non-zero $β$ in $K$, relative to a non-preperiodic point $α\in \mathbb{P}^1(\overline{K})$, under the power map $\varphi(z) =z^d $.</p></details>

This notion generalizes $τ_{[d]}$-tilting pairs of extended finitely generated modules over finite-dimensional algebras to a more general framework, which includes both extended large modules over unitary rings and truncated subcategories of finite-dimensional derived categories of proper non-positive differential graded algebras. Within this setting, we establish a bijection between AIR tilting subcategories and silting subcategories. Furthermore, we define quasi-tilting and tilting subcategories of extended hearts, extending the corresponding notions from module categories, and investigate their fundamental properties along with the relationships among these tilting-related classes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Bicritical rational functions -- those with precisely two critical points -- include the well-studied families of unicritical polynomials and quadratic rational functions. In this article we lay out general foundations for studying arithmetic dynamical properties of bicritical rational functions, and prove new Galois-theoretic results for a family with special properties. We study the field of definition of the critical points, and give a normal form up to Möbius conjugacy over this field. As a corollary, we show that after a finite extension of the ground field, the arboreal Galois representation attached to a bicritical rational function injects into an iterated wreath product of cyclic groups. We then examine the family of quadratic $φ\in \mathbb{Q}(x)$ with critical points $γ_1$ and $γ_2$ such that $φ(γ_1) = γ_2$. Adapting methods of Odoni-Stoll in the polynomial case to rational functions, we show that the arboreal representation is surjective for an infinite subfamily.</p></details>

We prove that under some restrictions, an alternating snake defines a canonical monoidal category. We prove that this category has finitely many prime objects. As a consequence we prove that the Grothendieck ring is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of the category $\mathscr C_ξ$ for a suitable height function. In particular it follows that the special family of alternating snakes provides a monoidal categorification of a cluster algebra of type $A_N$ for a suitable value of $N$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any integer $d \geq 2$ and prime power $q$, we construct unexpectedly large induced matchings in the point-line incidence graph of $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{d}$ by leveraging a new connection with the Furstenberg-Sárközy problem from arithmetic combinatorics. In particular, we significantly improve the previously well-known baselines when $q$ is prime, showing that $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}$ contains matchings of size $q^{1.233}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{d}$ contains matchings of size $q^{d-o_{d}(1)}$. These results and their proofs have several applications. First, we also obtain new constructions for finite field Nikodym sets in dimension $d \geq 2$, improving recent results of Tao by polynomial factors. For example, when $q$ is prime, we show the existence of Nikodym sets in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$ of size $q^d - q^{d - o_d(1)}$. Second, we construct a new minimal blocking set in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$, solving a longstanding problem in finite geometry. Third, we obtain new constructions for the minimal distance problem (in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and also in higher dimensions), improving a recent result of Logunov-Zakharov. We also obtain analogous results for general finite fields with large characteristics. In particular, in one of our constructions we introduce a new special set of points inside the norm hypersurface in $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{d}$, which directly generalizes the classical Hermitian unital and which may be of independent interest for applications.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a field and $X$ a smooth projective variety over $k$. When $k$ is a number field, the Beilinson-Bloch conjecture relates the ranks of the Chow groups of $X$ to the order of vanishing of certain $L$-functions. We consider the same conjecture when $k$ is a global function field, and give a criterion for the conjecture to hold for $X$, extending an earlier result of Jannsen. As an application, we provide a new proof of a theorem of Geisser connecting the Tate conjecture over finite fields and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture over function fields. We then prove the Tate conjecture for a product of a smooth projective curve with a power of a CM elliptic curve over any finitely generated field, and thus deduce special cases of the Beilinson--Bloch conjecture. In the process we obtain a conditional answer to a question of Moonen on the Chow groups of powers of ordinary CM elliptic curves over arbitrary fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1990, Baker and Montgomery conjectured that $L'(s,χ_d)$ has $\asymp \log\log |d|$ real zeros in the interval $[1/2,1]$ for almost all fundamental discriminants $d$. The study of these zeros was motivated by their connection to real zeros of Fekete polynomials and to sign changes of the character sums $\sum_{n\leq x}χ_d(n)$. Recent work of Klurman, Lamzouri, and Munsch shows that the number of such zeros is $\gg (\log\log |d|)/(\log\log\log\log |d|)$ for almost all $d$, thereby establishing the conjectured lower bound up to the factor $\log\log\log\log |d|$. In this paper, we prove that for almost all fundamental discriminants $d$, $L'(s,χ_d)$ has at most $(\log\log |d|)(\log\log\log |d|)$ real zeros in $[1/2,1]$, thus resolving the Baker-Montgomery conjecture up to a factor of $\log\log\log |d|$. We also give a quantitative upper bound on the exceptional set of discriminants. Furthermore, we show, conditionally on certain natural assumptions, that $100\%$ of these zeros lie away from $1/2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a computational study of 200 composite integers of approximately 350 bits, engineered using the Arnault framework to pass all Miller-Rabin tests up to base 11. Generated at a rate of approximately 20 per hour from a high-throughput construction process producing ~7,700 Carmichael numbers per minute, all samples fail the strong Lucas probable prime test. We introduce the U-bit collapse metric delta = log_2(n) - log_2(U_d mod n) to quantify deviation from the expected uniform distribution of Lucas sequence terms. Analysis reveals minimal collapse values: mean delta = 1.61 bits, median delta = 1.0 bits, maximum delta = 8 bits, with 26% showing no measurable collapse. We analyze correlations with prime residue classes modulo 35, Arnault construction parameters (k,M), and composite bit-sizes. Our results demonstrate that composites engineered for Miller-Rabin resistance exhibit negligible Lucas sequence degeneracy, providing strong empirical evidence for the statistical independence of these two primality test components and supporting the continued robustness of Baillie-PSW-type tests.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The aim of this paper is to consider the extensibility of the Diophantine triple $\{2,b,c\}$, where $2<b<c$, and to prove that such a set cannot be extended to an irregular Diophantine quadruple. We succeed in that for some families of $c$'s (depending on $b$). As corollary, for example, we prove that for $b/2-1$ prime, all Diophantine quadruples $\{2,b,c,d\}$ with $2<b<c<d$ are regular.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The focus of this article is on metric completions of triangulated categories arising in the representation theory of hereditary finite dimensional algebras and commutative rings. We explicitly describe all completions of bounded derived categories with respect to additive good metrics for two classes of rings - hereditary commutative noetherian rings and hereditary algebras of tame representation type over an algebraically closed field. To that end, we develop and study the lattice theory of metrics on triangulated categories. Moreover, we establish a link between metric completions of bounded derived categories of a ring and the ring's universal localisations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We classify the unimodular Euclidean integral lattices of rank 29 by developing an elementary, yet very efficient, inductive method. As an application, we determine the isometry classes of even lattices of rank at most 28 and prime (half-)determinant at most 7. We also provide new isometry invariants allowing for independent verification of the completeness of our lists, and we give conceptual explanations of some unique orbit phenomena discovered during our computations. Some of the genera classified here are orders of magnitude larger than any genus previously classified. In a forthcoming companion paper, we use these computations to study the cohomology of GL_n(Z).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish completely log-free bounds for exponential sums over the primes and the Möbius function. Let $0<η\leq 1/10$, and suppose $α= a/q + δ/x$, with $(a,q)=1$ and $|δ| \leq x^{1/5 + η}/q$, and set $δ_0 = \max(1, |δ|/4)$. For $x \geq x_0(η)$ sufficiently large, we show that: \begin{equation*} \Biggl| \sum_{n \leq x} Λ(n) e(nα) \Biggr| \leq \frac{q}{\varphi(q)} \frac{\mathscr{F}_η\bigl( \frac{\log δ_0 q}{\log x}, \frac{\log^+ δ_0/q}{\log x} \bigr) \cdot x }{\sqrt{δ_0 q}} \ \text{ and } \ \Biggl| \sum_{n \leq x} μ(n) e(nα) \Biggr| \leq \frac{\mathscr{G}_η\bigl( \frac{\log δ_0 q}{\log x}, \frac{\log^+ δ_0/q}{\log x} \bigr) \cdot x}{\sqrt{δ_0 \varphi(q)}}, \end{equation*} for all $1 \leq q \leq x^{2/5 - η}$, where $\log^+ z = \max(\log z, 0)$, and the functions $\mathscr{F}_η$ and $\mathscr{G}_η$ are explicitly determined, taking small to moderate values. These bounds improve substantially upon the existing results - particularly with respect to the permissible ranges of $q$, $δ$ in which log-free bounds are known to hold and potentially with respect to asymptotic functions $\mathscr{F}_η$ and $\mathscr{G}_η$ as well. Moreover, the range $1 \leq q \leq x^{2/5 - η}$ is essentially the best possible we can expect. The main innovation is a sieve-weighted version of Vaughan's identity (Lemma 2.1), which is effectively log-free. We employ several ideas and results from the pioneering work of Helfgott, and particularly, they play a central role in ensuring the log-freeness of the type-I contribution. Also, like in his work, these bounds improve as $δ$ increases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a framework of monoidal categorification of finite type cluster algebras involving triangulated monoidal categories. Namely, given a Dynkin quiver $Q$, we consider the bounded homotopy category $\mathcal{K}_Q^{(1)}$ of a symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{H}_Q^{(1)}$ that we define in terms of the Auslander-Reiten theory of $Q$. Using some iterated mapping cone procedure, we construct a distinguished family $\{ C_{\bullet}[β] \}_{β\in Δ_+}$ of chain complexes in $\mathcal{K}_Q^{(1)}$ characterized (up to isomorphism) by homological conditions similar to those of higher exact sequences appearing in the context of higher homological algebra. We then prove that the distinguished triangle in $\mathcal{K}_Q^{(1)}$ given by each mapping cone categorifies an exchange relation in the finite type cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}_Q$ with initial exchange quiver $Q$ (for a suitable choice of frozen variables). As a consequence, we obtain that for each positive root $β$, the Euler characteristic of $C_{\bullet}[β]$ coincides with the truncated $q$-character of the simple module $L[β]$ in the HL category $\mathcal{C}_ξ^{(1)}$ categorifying the cluster variable $x[β]$ of $\mathcal{A}_Q$ via Hernandez-Leclerc's monoidal categorification. Along the way, we establish a uniform formula for the dominant monomial of $L[β]$ in all types $A_n$ and $D_n$ for arbitrary orientations (agreeing with Brito-Chari's results in type $A_n$).</p></details>

> **Comment:** 30 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider Iwahori-Coulomb branches $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N},\mathbf{V}}^{\mathrm{Fl}}$, which are the affine flag analogs of the original Coulomb branches $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^{\mathrm{Gr}}$ defined by Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima. For any conical symplectic resolution $X$, we prove that the $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N},\mathbf{V}}^{\mathrm{Fl}}$-action on the localized equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$, induced by shift operators, satisfies a polynomiality property in terms of stable envelopes. We then study the case $X = T^*(G/P)$, the cotangent bundle of a flag variety, for which the Iwahori-Coulomb branch is isomorphic to the trigonometric double affine Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}_{G,\hbar,k}$. The polynomiality property enables us to compute explicitly the above action in terms of the Demazure-Lusztig elements and stable envelopes. Applications include: (1) Computation of the Iwarhori-Coulomb branch action for $G/P$ by taking the confluent limit, recovering Peterson-Lam-Shimozono's theorem. (2) Construction of an explicit Namikawa-Weyl group action on the equivariant quantum cohomology of $T^*(G/P)$ that preserves the quantum product, extending a result of Li-Su-Xiong. (3) Proof of a conjecture of Braverman-Finkelberg-Nakajima stating that, up to a shift of the dilation parameter, $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathfrak{g}^*}^{\mathrm{Gr}}$ is isomorphic to the spherical subalgebra of $\mathcal{H}_{G,\hbar,k}$.</p></details>
