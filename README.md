### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19727v2'>2602.19727</a>\]&nbsp; **On the analytic continuation of Dirichlet series with missing digits**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jean-François Burnol &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Dirichlet series associated with the integers whose radix-$b$ representation misses certain (fixed) digits. The existence of a meromorphic continuation to the entire complex plane, which was already well-known as a general fact valid for $b$-automatic Dirichlet series, is proven anew from a representation as an everywhere defined series with good convergence properties. A generating function related to the residues on the real axis is shown to be the multiplicative inverse of the moment generating function for the associated Cantor set in the unit interval. This makes the (normalized) residues some sort of generalized Bernoulli numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(\bar{M}, ω)$ be a compact symplectic manifold with convex boundary and $c_1(T\bar{M})=0$. Suppose that $(\bar{M}, ω)$ is equipped with a convex Hamiltonian $G$-action for some connected, compact Lie group $G$. We construct an action of the pure Coulomb branch of $G$ on the $G$-equivariant symplectic cohomology of $\bar{M}.$ Building on work of Teleman, we use this construction to characterize the Coulomb branches of Braverman-Finkelberg-Nakajima in terms of equivariant symplectic cohomology.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Philemon Urbain Mballa &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we explore a natural extension of the quadratic parametrization introduced in our previous work. By replacing the integer $n$ by $n^s$ ($ s\in\mathbb{R}, s>1$) and allowing the parameters to be real, we obtain for each $n\ge 1$ a decomposition $\frac{k}{n^s} = \frac{1}{x_s(n)}+\frac{1}{y_s(n)}+\frac{1}{z_s(n)}$ with $x_s(n), y_s(n), z_s(n) \in \mathbb{R}^*+$. Summing this equality over all integers brings forth the Riemann zeta function. Subject to an analytic continuation of the quantities $x_s(n), y_s(n), z_s(n)$ to complex values of $s$, one would obtain a new function \(G_k(s)\) satisfying $G_k(s)=k\,ζ(s)$, thus establishing a deep connection between the structure of the conjecture and the zeros of $ζ$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime and let $L$ be a quadratic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-lattice with quadratic form $Q$. For $t\neq 0$ the local representation density $α_p(t;L)$ is the stable normalised growth of the congruence counts of solutions to $Q(v)\equiv t\pmod{p^m}$. We compute these counts and densities explicitly for the hyperbolic plane $H_0$ over $\mathbb{Z}p$, uniformly in $p$, and at $p=2$ for the basic dyadic blocks (rank-$1$ Type I blocks and the even binary planes $2^aH\varepsilon$), together with the anisotropic ternary lattice $L_3=\langle 2\rangle^{\oplus 3}$. At the dyadic prime the usual Jacobian/Hensel lifting mechanism breaks down in the bilinear-lattice convention $Q(v)=\langle v,v\rangle$. The main new input is an explicit half-lift involution for diagonal sums of squares, which yields a stable lifting recursion with factor $2^{d-1}$ under the primitivity hypothesis $4\nmid a$. As applications we obtain closed forms for the three-squares congruence counts (hence $α_2(t;L_3)$) and a prime-uniform formula for the densities of the scaled hyperbolic planes $p^eH_0$ in the standard normalisation $q=\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle/2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime number, $n$ an integer $\geq 2$, and $L$ a finite extension of $\mathrm{Q}_p$. Let $ρ_L$ be an $n$-dimensional (non-critical but not necessary generic) potentially crystalline $p$-adic Galois representation of the absolute Galois groups of $L$ of regular Hodge-Tate weights. By generalizing the previous results and strategy for the crystabelline case of Ding and the recent work of Breuil-Ding, we construct an explicit locally analytic representation $π_{1}(ρ_L)$, and describe explicitly the information of Hodge filtration of $ρ_L$ it determines. When $ρ_L$ comes from a patched $p$-adic automorphic representation, we show that $π_{1}(ρ_L)$ is a subrepresentation of the $\mathrm{GL}_n(L)$-representation globally associated to $ρ_L$, under some mild hypothesis.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 62 pages, v3) final version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a treatment of relative Calabi--Yau structures on functors between $R$-linear stable $\infty$-categories, with $R$ any $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-ring spectrum, generalizing previous treatments in the setting of dg-categories. Using their gluing properties, we further construct relative Calabi--Yau structures on the global sections of perverse schobers, i.e. categorified perverse sheaves, on surfaces with boundary. We treat examples related to Fukaya categories and representation theory. In a related direction, we define the monodromy of a perverse schober parametrized by a ribbon graph on a framed surface and show that it forms a local system of stable $\infty$-categories.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 11 pages, comments are welcome! Github repo: https://github.com/NirvanaC93/Torsion-of-GL2-abelian-varieties

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is well known that the rational torsion of an abelian variety defined over a number field injects into the reduction modulo any sufficiently large prime, so the order of the torsion group divides the greatest common divisor of the sizes of points on the reduction at each prime. Drawing inspiration from Katz's Inventiones paper (1981), we investigate the converse to this for abelian varieties of $\rm GL_2$-type and exhibit a conjectural list of possible torsion orders for modular abelian varieties over $\mathbb Q$ of dimension up to $5$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 142 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a finite group $Γ$, we prove results on the distribution of the prime to $q|Γ|$-part of fundamental groups of $Γ$-covers of the projective line $\mathbb P^1_{\mathbb F_q}$ over a finite field $\mathbb F_q$ as $q\to\infty$. Equivalently, this is a result on the distribution of the Galois groups of maximal unramified extension of $Γ$-extensions of $\mathbb F_q(t)$, and thereby motivates a new conjecture on the distribution of Galois groups of maximal unramified extension of $Γ$-extensions of a number field. In particular, this allows us to see and predict the effect of roots of unity in the base field on such distributions. We introduce the idea to study these groups along with the class in their 3rd homology group that arises from Artin-Verdier duality. This invariant refines the lifting invariant that, in the function field setting, corresponds to stable components of Hurwitz space. One major input into our function field results is an application of our recently developed methods to determine a distribution of groups (or more general algebraic structures) from its moments. We prove non-existence results in the number field case that support our conjectures in the case where our conjectures predict certain kinds of groups occur with probability zero.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 30 pages, fixed some typos

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f$ be a Rademacher or Steinhaus random multiplicative function. For various arithmetically interesting subsets $\mathcal A\subseteq [1, N]\cap\mathbb N$ such that the distribution of $\sum_{n\in \mathcal A} f(n)$ is approximately Gaussian, we develop a general framework to understand the large fluctuations of the sum. This extends the general central limit theorem framework of Soundararajan and Xu. In the case when $\mathcal A = (N-H, N]$ is a short interval with admissible $H=H(N)$, we show that almost surely \begin{equation*} \limsup_{N\to\infty} \frac{\big\lvert\sum_{N-H<n\leq N} f(n)\big\rvert}{\sqrt{H\log \frac{N}H{}}}>0. \end{equation*} When $\mathcal A$ is the set of values of an admissible polynomial $P\in\mathbb Z[x]$, we extend work of Klurman, Shkredov, and Xu, as well as Chinis and the author, showing that almost surely \begin{equation*} \limsup_{N\to\infty} \frac{\big\lvert\sum_{n\leq N} f(P(n))\big\rvert}{\sqrt{N \log\log N}}>0, \end{equation*} even when $P$ is a product of linear factors over $\mathbb Q$. In this case, we also establish the corresponding almost sure upper bound, matching the law of iterated logarithm. An important ingredient in our work is bounding the Kantorovich--Wasserstein distance by means of a quantitative martingale central limit theorem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A famous result of P. Hegedüs describes the structure of finite rational $\{2,5\}$-groups. In this paper, we show how Hegedüs' proof can be used to obtain a similar result for the more general situation of a finite rational $2$-group acting faithfully and with the eigenvector property on a f.d $\mathbb{F}_p$-vector space with $p\geq 5$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 33 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that, conditional on Zywina's effective version of the Serre uniformity conjecture, there is a natural way to parameterize non-CM $\mathbb{Q}$-rational points on all modular curves in terms of the rational points on finitely many modular curves. Our proof refines Zywina's work to give a (conditional) parameterization of the images of adelic Galois representations of elliptic curves. In particular, we show that there are 41 $j$-invariants of elliptic curves whose associated Galois image does not vary in an infinite family. Using our explicit parameterization, we show that all rational points on all modular curves arise from the geometry of modular curves in a formal sense, confirming a philosophy of Mazur and Ogg.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Updated to add Section 7. 48 pages. Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the problem of lifting the Artin--Schreier--Witt isogeny from characteristic $p>0$ to characteristic $0$, which is central to the lifting problem for Galois covers of algebraic schemes in positive characteristic. We introduce a new technique that associates a Kummer class, representing a tamely ramified cyclic extension, to a Witt vector via Matsuda's Kummer--Artin--Schreier--Witt theory. This viewpoint leads to an explicit construction of a lift of the isogeny over a concrete base ring. Our results lay the groundwork for further applications, including the study of inseparable extensions and Kato's refined Swan conductor.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent breakthrough, Kalmynin proved a conjecture of Lev--Sonn and a conjecture of Sárközy on additive decompositions of multiplicative subgroups of a prime field. In this paper, we prove a multiplicative analogue of Kalmynin's result on a generalization of the Lev--Sonn conjecture, inspired by a relevant conjecture of Sárközy. We show that all nonzero shifts of proper multiplicative subgroups (of size at least $3$) are not ratio sets of the form $A/A$. This in particular extends a result of Shkredov, where he showed the same for small multiplicative subgroups (of size $<p^{6/7}$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$). We also prove an analogous statement over complex numbers for finite subgroups of the unit circle, which may be of independent interest.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 75 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the average distribution of primes of size $x$ in arithmetic progressions to moduli larger than $x^{\frac{1}{2}}$. Using arithmetic information from the works of many authors together with different variants of the original Harman's sieve, we construct suitable majorants and minorants for the prime indicator function $\mathbb{1}_p(n)$ that satisfy Bombieri-Vinogradov type mean value theorems with different types of moduli. Specifically, we obtain some mean value theorems for primes with bilinear forms of moduli up to $x^{\frac{9}{17}}$ or with trilinear forms of moduli up to $x^{\frac{17}{32}}$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jeremie Guilhot, Loic Poulain d'Andecy &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>With an eye to applications to type A and Schur-Weyl duality, we study Kazhdan-Lusztig bases for a general parabolic Hecke algebra. Parabolic Hecke algebras are idempotent subalgebras of Hecke algebras corresponding to parabolic subgroups, and for type A they coincide with the fused Hecke algebras appearing in a generalisation of the Schur-Weyl duality with the quantum group of GL(N). In this paper we investigate two different Kazhdan-Lusztig bases for parabolic Hecke algebras, together with the associated cells and the corresponding representations. We quickly specialise to type A, for which we describe the cells in terms of the RSK correspondence generalising thus the well-known description for the symmetric group. As a first application we recover the classification of irreducible representations of parabolic Hecke algebras of type A and provide a new construction of these representations. Next we turn to the Schur-Weyl duality and describe the kernel in terms of one the basis studied precedently. Moreover, we formulate some conjectures about a generator of these kernels in terms of Kazhdan-Lusztig basis elements, give some evidence and prove these conjectures in some special cases.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2. 19 pages. Mathematical content unchanged. Introduction rewritten

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish an analog of a theorem of Stallings which asserts the homomorphisms between the universal nilpotent quotients induced by a homomorphism $G \to H$ of groups are isomorphisms provided a pair of homological conditions are satisfied. Our analogy does not have a homomorphism between $G$ and $H$ but instead $G,H \leq G_0$ that satisfies a similar homological condition. We derive a few applications of this result. First, we show that there exist pairs of non-isomorphic number fields whose absolute Galois groups have isomorphic universal nilpotent quotients. We show that there exists pairs of non-isometric hyperbolic $n$-manifolds whose fundamental groups are residually nilpotent and have isomorphic universal nilpotent quotients. These are the first examples of residually nilpotent Kleinian groups with arbitrarily large nilpotent genus. Complex hyperbolic 2-manifold examples are given as well. Considering Riemann surfaces and complex hyperbolic 2-manifolds as projective curves and surfaces defined over a number field, we show the (outer) action of the absolute Galois group of the field of definition on the universal nilpotent quotients of the geometric fundamental groups are equivalent. This is in contrast to fact that the (outer) Galois action on the geometric fundamental group of a projective hyperbolic curve determines the curve by work of Mochizuki. In particular, the nilpotent representation theory of the geometric fundamental group is not anabelian.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 26 pages, 6 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the quantum modularity of the signature of $ \mathrm{SU}(2) $-TQFT for a genus 2 surface, which was conjectured by Marché--Masbaum in 2025. Our approach is based on a quantum modularity of generalized Dedekind sums associated with general modular forms. In the case of Eisenstein series for $ Γ(N) $, these generalized Dedekind sums admit trigonometric sum expressions, which coincide with the formula for the $ \mathrm{SU}(2) $-TQFT signature. Furthermore, we express both the $ \mathrm{SU}(2) $-TQFT and generalized Dedekind sums as radial limits of Eichler integrals.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the pro-$p$ Iwahori-Hecke algebra and its Gelfand-Graev modules for the $p$-adic general linear group and its metaplectic covers. We develop the theory of quantum wreath products of skew polynomial type and use it to provide transparent descriptions of these Hecke algebras and their modules that were previously inaccessible through standard $p$-adic methods. We introduce the notion of (anti)spherical and Kashiwara-Miwa-Stern modules for these quantum wreath products for the first time and interpret the $p$-adic Gelfand-Graev modules in terms of these new modules. As an application, we study the structure theory for the corresponding $p$-adic pro-$p$ Schur algebras and obtain an explicit basis and multiplication rules. Moreover, we give algebraic (re)proofs of several results of $p$-adic interest including the existence of PBW basis for the pro-$p$ metaplectic and Iwahori-Hecke algebras, identification of the Iwahori-Schur algebra with the quantum affine Schur algebra, and failure of the local Shimura correspondence at the pro-$p$ level.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate integers whose base $g$ expansion omits a fixed digit and which can be represented as a sum of two prime squares. In the first part of the paper, we apply the Hardy--Littlewood circle method to obtain asymptotic formulas for weighted count of representations of such integers up to $g^k$ as $k\to\infty$, where we weight by the von Mangoldt function. In this case, we also get an interesting bias depending on the fixed digit we are missing. In the second part, combining the circle method with sieve methods, we study the second moment of the corresponding unweighted counting function. This allows us to get a nontrivial lower bound for the cardinality of the set $$\{ n \leq g^k : n \text{ omits the digit } b \text{ in its base } g \text{ expansion and } n = p^2 + q^2 \text{ for some primes } p,q \}. $$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we investigate equivariant recollements of abelian (resp. triangulated) categories. We first characterize when a recollement of abelian (resp. triangulated) categories induces an equivariant recollement, i.e. a recollement between the corresponding equivariant abelian (resp. triangulated) categories. We further investigate singular equivalences in the context of equivariant abelian recollements. In particular, we characterize when a singular equivalence induced by the quotient functor in an abelian recollement lifts to a singular equivalence induced by the equivariant quotient functor. As applications of our results: (i) we construct equivariant recollements for the derived category of a quasi-compact, quasi-separated scheme where the action comes from a subgroup of the automorphism group of the scheme and (ii) we establish new singular equivalences between certain skew group algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We derive a new Rademacher complexity bound for deep neural networks using Koopman operators, group representations, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). The proposed bound describes why the models with high-rank weight matrices generalize well. Although there are existing bounds that attempt to describe this phenomenon, these existing bounds can be applied to limited types of models. We introduce an algebraic representation of neural networks and a kernel function to construct an RKHS to derive a bound for a wider range of realistic models. This work paves the way for the Koopman-based theory for Rademacher complexity bounds to be valid for more practical situations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide new local characterizations of Hida families of Siegel modular forms with genus two arising from automorphic inductions (stable Yoshida lifts), analogous to the characterizations of Hida families of CM modular forms provided by Ghate--Vatsal. Our characterizations involve (i) density of de Rham at $p$ specializations at the singular weights $(k,2)$ and (ii) local decomposability at $p$ of the associated $Λ$-adic Galois representation. Our approach is similar to that of Castella--Wang-Erickson who provided an alternate strategy to reproving the main results of Ghate--Vatsal by applying Ribet's method when an anti-cyclotomic class group is assumed to be pseudo-null and cyclic as a $Λ$-module. Along these lines, one key input to our methods involves an assumption of pseudo-nullity of Selmer groups that are defined by imposing stricter conditions at $p$ than those imposed for the usual Greenberg Selmer groups appearing in the Asai main conjectures over real quadratic fields. Following Genestier--Tilouine and Pilloni, we also prove a minimal $R=\mathbb{T}$ theorem that is essential to establishing our results at various stages.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study existential theories of henselian valued fields of positive characteristic with parameters from a trivially valued subfield. Compared to previous work, we relax perfectness and separability assumptions, and instead work with the weaker algebraic hypothesis of formal smoothness over the parameter field, which we discuss in detail in our setting. Assuming a weak consequence of resolution of singularities, which was already used in previous work, we obtain an axiomatisation of the existential theory of such a valued field in terms of the existential theory of the residue field, both over the same parameter field. This result has natural applications to asymptotic theories of completions of function fields of curves. We work these out in detail for the case of function fields over fairly general pseudo-algebraically closed fields, where we obtain decidability of the sets of universal/existential sentences holding in all completions or all but finitely many completions, respectively.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we present a method based on contour integration to investigate a class of cyclotomic parametric Apéry-like series. The general term of such series involves a parametric central binomial coefficient, which is defined via the Gamma function. Using this approach, we express a family of cyclotomic Apéry-like series in terms of multiple polylogarithms, cyclotomic Hurwitz zeta values, Riemann zeta values and $\log(2)$. In particular, we provide several illustrative examples and corollaries, which enable us to recover a number of known results on Apéry-like series. At the same time, we have also left open two questions regarding Apéry-like series. Moreover, by considering integrals of the generating function for Fuss-Catalan numbers, we derive an alternative expression for a classical Apéry-like series. Combining this with known results allows us to establish several identities for multiple polylogarithm functions.</p></details>

Let $(L_n^{(k)})_{n\geq 2-k}$ be the $k$-Lucas number sequence defined by the recurrence relation $ L_n^{(k)} = L_{n-1}^{(k)} + \cdots + L_{n-k}^{(k)}$, for all $n \ge 2$, with initial terms \( L_0^{(k)} = 2 \) and \( L_1^{(k)} = 1 \) for all \( k \ge 2 \), and \( L_{2-k}^{(k)} = \cdots = L_{-1}^{(k)} = 0 \) for \( k \ge 3 \).

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper applies the modular approach to obtain effectively computable bounds for Fermat-type equations over number fields, while also discussing the differences and obstructions that arise when considering such equations over totally real versus totally complex number fields. We use these techniques to study the generalized Fermat equation $d^ra^p+b^p+c^p=0$ over quadratic fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ of class number one. Extending the results of Freitas\&Siksek and Turcas, we show that when $d=-3,-11,3,5,7,11,13,19,23$, there is an effective and explicit bound, depending on the field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$, such that the latter equation does not have certain types of special solutions. In addition, we obtain effective bounds for $d=-19,-43$, showing that the same equation has no non-trivial solutions of this type. We also discuss, for $d=6,14,21$, the solutions of a variant of the above equation. Our results over imaginary quadratic fields are conjectural. Serre's modularity conjecture and an analogue of Eichler-Shimura over totally complex fields are assumed.</p></details>

When $g(X_H)\geq 2$ this is equivalent to determining all the hyperelliptic modular curves of prime-power level and all the bielliptic modular curves of prime-power level that admit a degree two map to a positive rank elliptic curve. From the moduli perspective, this means that there are exactly 1085 subgroups $H$ of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\widehat{\mathbb{Z}})$ of prime-power level for which there are infinitely many elliptic curves $E/K$ over quadratic extensions such that $ρ_E(G_k)$ is conjugate to a subgroup of $H$.</p></details>

This algebraic identification is deduced by relating degenerate affine Hecke algebras to the simplest example of a rational Feigin-Odesskii shuffle product.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For every prime $p \geq 5$, we compute the $p$-th power of the Ramanujan vector field that arises from the differential relations discovered by Ramanujan for the Eisenstein series $E_2,E_4$ and $E_6$. Our method results in explicit equations for the $p$-th power and uses classical results of Serre and Swinnerton-Dyer about modular forms modulo $p$. From this, we verify that a general conjecture by Sheperd-Barron and Ekedahl is valid for the Ramanujan vector field. Furthermore, we consider the affine realization of a certain moduli space of elliptic curves where the Ramanujan vector field is defined, and describe - in characteristic $p$ - the locus given by supersingular elliptic curves in two ways: a classical one - using equations for the supersingular polynomial - and a new one as the singular set of some vector fields. Additionally, we prove that the Ramanujan vector field is transversal to this locus.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Philemon Urbain Mballa &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article develops a parametric approach to study the Diophantine equation \(\frac{k}{n} = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z}\), underlying the Erdős--Straus (\(k=4\)), Sierpiński (\(k=5\)), and their generalizations. We introduce and analyze the fundamental function \(F_{x,t}^{(k)}(n) = t^2(kx-n)^2 - 2nxt\), whose perfect square values are equivalent to solutions of the conjectures. For any fixed pair \((x,t)\), we define its admissible domain \(\mathcal{D}_{x,t}^{(k)}\) and prove that on this domain, \(F\) is strictly decreasing, non-negative, and converges to its minimum. A key result is the Zero Lemma: if \(F(n_0)=0\) for some \(n_0\) in the domain, then \(n_0\) is necessarily the upper bound of \(\mathcal{D}_{x,t}^{(k)}\), and such zeros of \(F\) yield explicit symmetric solutions with \(y=z\). As an illustration, in the classical Erdős--Straus case (\(k=4\)), we explicitly construct symmetric solutions \(y = z\) for all integers \(n \equiv 0,2,3 \pmod{4}\), covering already \(75\%\) of all integers. For the remaining class \(n \equiv 1 \pmod{4}\), which is traditionally more challenging, we construct explicit symmetric solutions based on the existence of a divisor \(b \equiv 3 \pmod{4}\), and we show that this condition is satisfied for almost all such integers: the set of exceptions has natural density zero. Consequently, the Erdős--Straus conjecture is verified for a proportion of integers tending to \(1\) in this class. In particular, we obtain infinitely many new explicit families of symmetric solutions for numbers not covered by Mordell's theorem. These results elucidate the structural behavior of \(F\) and provide a unified framework for generating large families of solutions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we establish two main results concerning the Mumford-Tate conjecture for hyper-Kähler varieties. First, we prove the conjecture for the semisimplified $\ell$-adic Galois representations attached to hyper-Kähler varieties with second Betti number $b_2 \geq 4$. As a direct consequence, we deduce that the Hodge conjecture implies the Tate conjecture for powers of hyper-Kähler varieties. Second, we show that the Mumford-Tate conjecture for hyper-Kähler varieties is invariant under deformation. The proofs rely on comparing the ranks of $\ell$-adic algebraic monodromy groups in higher degrees to those in degree $2$ via the theory of Frobenius tori and the Looijenga-Lunts-Verbitsky Lie algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article we study the endomorphism algebras of abelian varieties $A$ defined over a given number field $K$ with large cyclic 2-torsion fields. A key step in doing so is to provide criteria for all the endomorphisms of $A$ to be defined over $K(A[2])$, the field generated by its 2-torsion. When $K= \mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(A[2])/\mathbb{Q})$ is cyclic of prime order $p = 2 \dim(A) +1$, we prove that there are only finitely many possibilities for the geometric endomorphism algebra $\mathrm{End}(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$.In fact, when $\dim (A) \not \in \{3,5,9,21,33,81\}$, we show $\mathrm{End}(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ is a proper subfield of the $p$-th cyclotomic field. In particular, when $g=2$, $\mathrm{End}(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to either $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})$.</p></details>

To find these examples we generalise work of Cremona--Freitas to enumerate all congruences of a certain type between pairs of weight $2$ newforms $f \in S_2^{\mathrm{new}}(Γ_0(N))$ and $g \in S_2^{\mathrm{new}}(Γ_0(M))$ contained in the LMFDB (i.e., with $N, M < 10\,000$) and with coefficient fields of degree $\leq 4$. Passing from the modular forms to the corresponding abelian varieties we use visibility to (unconditionally) prove the existence of non-trivial elements of the Tate--Shafarevich group. Finally we construct an example of an abelian surface with $(\mathbb{Z}/7\mathbb{Z})^2 \subset \mathrm{Sha}(A/\mathbb{Q})$ which is (conjecturally) not visible in any abelian threefold.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a unital associative PI-algebra over a field of characteristic zero. We study which partitions $λ$ appear with nonzero multiplicities in the cocharacter sequence of $A$ for several classes of algebras $A$. Berele defines the eventual arm width $ω_0(A)$ to be the maximal integer $d$ so that if $λ$ appears with nonzero multiplicity in the cocharacter sequence of $A$, then $λ$ can have at most $d$ parts arbitrarily large. Berele also shows that if $A$ is Lie nilpotent, then $ω_0(A) = 1$. In the first part of this paper, we show that if $A$ is unital, then $ω_0(A) = 1$ if and only if $A$ is Lie nilpotent. To prove this statement, we show that the algebra of proper polynomials $B_n(A)$ is finite dimensional if and only if $A$ is Lie nilpotent. In the second part, we give a bound on the nonzero multiplicities $λ$ in the cocharacter sequence of $A$, when the T-ideal of identities of $A$ is equal to a product of T-ideals generated by long commutators. As an application, we show that for a Lie nilpotent algebra $A$, the nonzero multiplicities $m_λ(A)$ correspond to partitions $λ$ which are supported in step-like diagrams in which the number of steps grows with the index of Lie nilpotency. Finally, we give also some applications to the noncommutative invariant theory of the special linear group $\mathrm{SL}(n)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f(x)=(x^{k}+c)^{m}-ax^{n}\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$, where $k,m,n\in\mathbb{N}$ with $km>n$, and let $K=\mathbb{Q}(θ)$, where $θ$ is a root of $f(x)$. We investigate the arithmetic properties of the number fields that arise from this family. We first obtain an explicit formula for the discriminant of $f(x)$. Using this formula, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the monogeneity of $f(x)$, expressed in terms of the prime divisors of $a$ and $c$ and the parameters $k,m,n$. This yields infinite families of monogenic polynomials of arbitrary degree, including families with a non-square-free discriminant. Building on these results, we extend our algebraic characterization to composite polynomials, establishing some explicit conditions for the monogeneity of the composition of $f(x)$ with an arbitrary polynomial $g(x)$. From an analytic point of view, we derive asymptotic estimates for the number of monogenic polynomials in these families under natural assumptions. We further study non-monogeneity via the field index $i(K)$ and, for each prime $p$, provide sufficient conditions ensuring $ν_p(i(K))=1$, yielding partial progress toward a problem of Narkiewicz. We also highlight a connection with a class of differential equations naturally associated with $f(x)$. As an application, we determine the conditions under which the splitting field of $f(x)$ has a full symmetric Galois group. Several explicit examples illustrate our results.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{K}=\mathbb{F}_q((x^{-1}))$. Analogous to orthogonality in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a well-studied notion of ultrametric orthogonality in $\mathcal{K}^n$. In this paper, we extend the work of Soffer-Aranov and Behajaina on counting problems related to orthogonality in $\mathcal{K}^n$. For example, we resolve an open question posed in Soffer-Aranov and Behajaina by bounding the size of the largest ``orthogonal sets'' in $\mathcal{K}^n$. Furthermore, using similar ideas and techniques, we investigate analogues of Hadamard matrices over $\mathcal{K}$. Finally, we also use ultrametric orthogonality to compute the number of sublattices of $\mathbb{F}_q[x]^n$ with a certain geometric structure, and to determine the number of orthogonal bases of a sublattice in $\mathcal{K}^n$. The resulting formulas depend crucially on successive minima.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Traces of singular moduli were introduced and studied by Zagier in 1998. Being simultaneously the (traces of) values of a modular function ($j$-invariant) and Fourier coefficients of modular forms - which constitutes Zagier's duality - these integers are quite interesting. Since then, a substantial amount of research was devoted to various properties of these numbers, congruences in particular. We present an alternative point of view on these congruences, specifically, we view them as congruences between certain weight $3/2$ modular forms under repeated action of $U$-operator. That allows us to obtain a general result which includes some previously known results as special cases. Our approach is especially effective when the prime modulus is relatively small. In these cases, we obtain explanations for certain numerical observations and quantification of some previously known qualitative results. As an application, we obtain modulo $11$ congruences between the traces of singular moduli and class numbers of quadratic fields in the case when the twisted central special value of the $L$-function associated with the elliptic curve of conductor $11$ vanishes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}(W,S)$ be the Hecke algebra of the Coxeter system $(W,S)$ over $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm1}]$, where $W$ is the Weyl group of a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra. In this paper, we show that the matrix of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of $\mathcal{H}$ factorizes into a product of $|S|$ many matrices, each of which has entries as polynomials in $q$ with nonnegative coefficients. To achieve this goal, we use hybrid basis $TC^J$ for $J\subseteq S$ of $\mathcal{H}$, defined by Grojnowski-Haiman. The intermediate matrices in the aforementioned factorization turn out to be the transition matrices from $TC^J$-basis to $TC^I$-basis for $I\subset J$. Equivalently, these coefficients can be computed using a natural restriction map from $\mathcal{H}$ to the parabolic Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}_J$. Moreover, following the ideas from Grojnowski-Haiman, we also give a geometric proof of the positivity of these coefficients.</p></details>

As applications, we deduce in this case (a) a folklore conjecture of Breuil--Buzzard--Emerton on the crystalline slopes of Kisin's crystabelian deformation spaces, (b) Gouvea's $\lfloor\frac{k-1}{p+1}\rfloor$-conjecture on slopes of modular forms, and (c) the finiteness of irreducible components of the eigencurve. In addition, applying combinatorial arguments by Bergdall and Pollack, and by Ren, we deduce as corollaries in the reducible and strongly generic case, (d) Gouvea--Mazur conjecture, (e) a variant of Gouvea's conjecture on slope distributions, and (f) a refined version of Coleman's spectral halo conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article explains how to practically compute L-invariants of p-new eigenforms using p-adic L-series and exceptional zero phenomena. As proof of the utility, we compiled a data set consisting of over 150,000 L-invariants. We analyze qualitative and quantitative features found in the data. This includes conjecturing a statistical law for the distribution of the valuations of L-invariants in a fixed level as the weights of eigenforms approach infinity. One novel point of our investigation is that the algorithm is sensitive to compiling data for fixed Galois representations modulo p. Therefore, we explain new perspectives on L-invariants that are related to Galois representations. We propose understanding the structures in our data through the lens of deformation rings and moduli stacks of Galois representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this follow-up paper, we again inspect a surprising relationship between the set of $m$-periodic points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ and the coefficient $c$, where $K$ is any number field of degree $n\geq 2$, $d>2$ is an integer and $m\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$ is any fixed (period). As before, we again study counting problems which are inspired by advances on $m$-torsion point-counting in arithmetic statistics and $m$-periodic point-counting in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any prime $p\geq 3$ and for any fixed $\ell\in \mathbb{Z}_{ \geq 1}$ and (period) $m\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$, the average number of distinct $m$-periodic integral points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is unbounded or zero as $c$ tends to infinity. Motivated further by $K$-rational periodic point-counting work of Benedetto along with conjectural work of Hutz on $m$-periodic points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ for any prime $p\geq 5$ and any fixed $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove that for any fixed (period) $m\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$, the average number of distinct $m$-periodic integral points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$ as $c\to \infty$. Finally, we then apply here density, polynomial-counting, field-counting, and Sato-Tate equidistribution results from arithmetic statistics, and thereby obtaining further counting and statistical results on the irreducible monic polynomials, Artin-Mazur zeta functions, algebraic number fields, and lastly on Artin $L$-functions arising naturally in our polynomial discrete dynamical settings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $r\ge 1$ be an integer. For any multiple index $\mathbf{s}=(s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_r) \in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}^r$ with $s_r>1$, the multiple zeta value (MZV for short) is defined by \begin{align*} ζ(s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_r):=\sum_{1\leq k_1<k_2<\cdots<k_r} \frac{1}{k_1^{s_1}k_2^{s_2}\cdots k_r^{s_r}} \end{align*} and the multiple $t$-value is defined by \begin{align*} t(s_1,s_2,...,s_r):=\sum_{1\leq k_1<k_2<...<k_r} \frac{1}{(2k_1-1)^{s_1}(2k_2-1)^{s_2}...(2k_r-1)^{s_r}}, \end{align*} where if the index is empty, then we define the value $t(\emptyset):=1$. We denote by $\{a_1,\cdots,a_k\}^d$ the sequence formed by repeating the sequence $\{a_1,\cdots,a_k\}$ exactly $d$ times. Let $H(a,b)=ζ(\{2\}^a,3,\{2\}^b)$ and $T(a,b):=t(\{2\}^a,3,\{2\}^b)$. In this paper, by using the Lai-Lupu-Orr integral expressions for $H(a,b)$ and $T(a,b)$ and the properties of Beta function and Gamma function, we show that for any nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$, we have \begin{align*} H(a,b):=\frac{-4π^{2a+2b+2}}{(2a+2)!}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{ζ(2n)}{(2n+2a+2)(2n+2a+3)\cdots(2n+2a+2b+3)2^{2n}} \end{align*} and \begin{align*} T(a,b)=\frac{-2}{(2a+1)!}\left(\fracπ{2}\right)^{2a+2b+2} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{ζ(2n)}{(2n+2a+1)(2n+2a+2)\cdots(2n+2a+2b+2)2^{2n}}. \end{align*} This confirms two conjectures of Lupu proposed in [C.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\ell$ and $m$ be positive integers with $\ell \leq m$, and let $\mathcal{A} = (A_1, \ldots, A_m)$ be a finite sequence of finite subsets of a group $G$ (not necessarily abelian), written multiplicatively. The {\it generalized product set} $Π^{\ell}(\mathcal{A})$ is the set of all elements of $G$ which can be represented as a product of exactly $\ell$ elements from $\ell$ distinct sets from $\mathcal{A}$ taken in any order. DeVos, Goddyn and Mohar obtained the nontrivial lower bound for the size of this product set when $G$ is abelian. The DeVos-Goddyn-Mohar Theorem is a fundamental result in additive combinatorics which unifies various results from zero-sum combinatorics and has connections with subsequence sums and sumsets. In this paper, we obtain an optimal lower bound for the size of generalized product set $Π^{\ell}(\mathcal{A})$ in torsion-free groups (not necessarily abelian), and characterize the structure of underlying sets in the sequence $\mathcal{A} = (A_1, \ldots, A_m)$ for which $Π^{\ell}(\mathcal{A})$ achieves the optimal lower bound. By slightly modifying the arguments of the proofs in the case of torsion-free groups, we derive such inverse theorems in cyclic groups of prime orders also. Our proof of these result also yields a new proof of DeVos-Goddyn-Mohar Theorem in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Moreover, we extend these inverse results to arbitrary abelian groups. Furthermore, as an application, we generalize a theorem for subsequence sums due to Hamidoune in torsion-free groups, and obtain several other results for subsequence sums in arbitrary groups.</p></details>

Under the (necessary) assumption that the fusion category is separable, we show that any algebra is Morita equivalent to an admissible quotient of the path algebra of a $\mathcal{C}$-species. Moreover, we show that an algebra is hereditary if and only if no further quotient is required. These results generalise that of Gabriel's for finite-dimensional algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a novel framework for bounding the adapted power gain $G_p$ and approximation gain $G_a$ of coprime integer solutions to the generalized diagonal superelliptic equation $By^n = Ax^n + k$ with $x, y \ge 2$. By first deriving a purely structural lower bound for $G_a$, we demonstrate that these equations are inherently predisposed to high ABC-qualities ($q = G_a \cdot G_p$). Combined with the Strong ABC conjecture ($q < q_{max}$), we prove that the power gain is uniformly bounded by $G_p < q_{max}/G_{a,min}$, providing a theoretical foundation for the numerical observation $G_p < 3$ for $n=2$ under the Ultra-Strong conjecture ($q < 1.5$). Specifically, we show that for $k=1$, the structural density forces $q > n/2$, which excludes solutions for $n \ge 4$ under $q < 2$. We validate our theoretical bounds using high-quality ABC triples, specifically analyzing the Reyssat (1987), de Weger (1985), and Nitaj (1993) cases to demonstrate the sharpness of the structural approximation gain.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 37 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the relationship between Serre duality and the Mukai pairing for smooth and proper dg-algebras. We introduce an alternative definition of the Mukai pairing and prove that it coincides with the Mukai pairings defined by Căldăraru--Willerton and by Shklyarov. Our construction places both the Mukai pairing and Serre duality within a unified framework based on an elementary pairing between Hochschild homology and Hochschild cohomology. As a consequence, the adjointness of the boundary--bulk and bulk--boundary maps follows naturally. As an application, we investigate Auslander--Reiten theory for the perfect derived category of a non-positive smooth and proper dg-algebra. We construct an exact triangle of dg-$A$-$A$-bimodules, called a universal Auslander--Reiten triangle in the sense that the derived tensor product of this triangle with an indecomposable dg-$A$-module $M$ yields an Auslander--Reiten triangle starting from $M$. In particular, this provides a functorial construction of Auslander--Reiten triangles. In the case of path algebras of quivers, our construction recovers the universal Auslander--Reiten triangle associated with quiver Heisenberg algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a lattice/linear code, we define the Voronoi spherical cumulative density function (CDF) as the CDF of the $\ell_2$-norm/Hamming weight of a random vector uniformly distributed over the Voronoi cell. Using the first moment method together with a simple application of Jensen's inequality, we develop lower bounds on the expected Voronoi spherical CDF of a random lattice/linear code. Our bounds are valid for any finite dimension and are quite close to a ball-based lower bound. They immediately translate to new non-asymptotic upper bounds on the normalized second moment and the error probability of a random lattice over the additive white Gaussian noise channel, as well as new non-asymptotic upper bounds on the Hamming distortion and the error probability of a random linear code over the binary symmetric channel. In particular, we show that for most lattices in $\mathbb{R}^n$ the second moment is greater than that of a Euclidean ball with the same covolume only by a $\left(1+O(\frac{1}{n})\right)$ multiplicative factor. Similarly, for most linear codes in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ the expected Hamming distortion is greater than that of a corresponding Hamming ball only by an additive universal constant.</p></details>

When $m = 2^e$ with integer $e \geq 1,$ we also prove that the condition is equivalent to $\cos (θ/2^{e-1}) \in F,$ where $θ$ is the angle between $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}.$</p></details>

This generalizes our previous work which requires $d=1$ and restricts Schmidt-type counting estimates to approximation functions which decay fast enough. Novel techniques include a bootstrap scheme for the associated random walks despite algebraic obstructions, and a refined treatment of Dani's correspondence.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For two real bases $q_0, q_1 > 1$, a binary sequence $i_1 i_2 \cdots \in \{0,1\}^\infty$ is the $(q_0,q_1)$-expansion of the number $$ π_{q_0,q_1}(i_1 i_2 \cdots) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{i_k}{q_{i_1} \cdots q_{i_k}}. $$ Let $U_{q_0,q_1}$ be the set of all real numbers having a unique $(q_0,q_1)$-expansion. When the bases are equal, i.e., $q_0 = q_1 = q$, Allaart and Kong (2019) established the continuity in $q$ of the Hausdorff dimension of the univoque set $U_{q,q}$, building on the work of Komornik, Kong, and Li (2017). We derive explicit formulas for the Hausdorff dimension of $U_{q_0,q_1}$ and the entropy of the underlying subshift for arbitrary $q_0, q_1 > 1$, and prove the continuity of these quantities as functions of $(q_0, q_1)$. Our results also concern general dynamical systems described by binary shifts with a hole, including, in particular, the doubling map with a hole and (linear) Lorenz maps.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that finite-spectrum representations of compact quantum groups either in unital $C^*$-algebras $A$ or on Banach spaces $E$ exhibit the same Banach-space-modeled differential-geometric structure as their classical analogues: (a) they are Banach analytic manifolds; (b) locally homogeneous under conjugation by the pertinent Banach Lie group $U(A)$ or $GL(E)$; (c) with orbit maps fibering principally; (d) and hence with said orbit maps admitting local analytic splitting. We also identify the finite-spectrum unitary representations as precisely those that are norm-continuous in the appropriate sense when the compact quantum group has at least one classical point, again generalizing the classical parallel present in various forms in work of Kallman, Shtern and the author.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using the modular method, we study solutions to the Diophantine equation $$Aa^p+Bb^p=Cc^2$$ over number fields. We first prove an asymptotic result for general number fields satisfying an appropriate $S$-unit condition by assuming some standard conjectures in the case of fields that are not totally real. Specifically, we verify that this condition holds for an infinite family of real quadratic fields. Outside the asymptotic setting, we also obtain effective results. In particular, for the equation $$a^p+db^p=c^2$$ over $K= \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d})$ with $d \in \{3, 11, 19, 43, \}$ and $K= \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt d)$ with $d \in \{3, 5, 11, 13, 19, 29\}$, we find explicit bounds (depending on $d$) such that no non-trivial solutions of a certain type exist whenever $p$ exceeds these bounds.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any ring $R$, we investigate balanced pairs of classes of modules and their relations to cotorsion triples. We characterize the case when a balanced pair generates a tilting cotorsion pair, and dually, when it cogenerates a cotilting cotorsion pair. If $R$ is right noetherian, we prove that the pair consisting of Gorenstein projective modules and Gorenstein injective modules is balanced if and only if $R$ is right virtually Gorenstein. In [4], cotorsion torsion triples in abelian categories were employed in the representation theory of rectangular grids occurring in persistent homology theory. For module categories, we use infinite dimensional tilting theory to completely classify all cotorsion torsion triples by means of $1$-resolving subcategories of $\rfmod R$, and to give an explicit 1-1 correspondence between the formally dual notions of cotorsion torsion triples of right $R$-modules and torsion cotorsion triples of left $R$-modules. This correspondence is bijective in case the underlying ring $R$ is left noetherian, but not in general.</p></details>

It was revisited in its present form by Candelas, de la Ossa, Elmi and van Straten, whose computations of Euler factors in a whole pencil of Calabi-Yau threefolds highlighted this fibre as one of three overwhelmingly likely to be ``rank-2 attractors''.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Constructing permutation polynomials over finite fields, particularly those with simple algebraic structure in multiple variables, is a fundamental problem with applications in cryptography and coding theory. Recently, Li and Kaleyski (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2024) generalized two sporadic quadratic APN permutations into infinite families of trivariate functions. Motivated by their work, we investigate conditions under which generalized trivariate functions fail to be permutations. We establish necessary conditions on coefficient parameters that prevent the permutation property, provide a complete computational classification for small field extensions, and prove general non-permutation results. As a key application of our algebraic geometry approach, we resolve the permutation part of a conjecture by Beierle, Carlet, Leander, and Perrin (Finite Fields Appl., 2022) regarding a related trivariate form. Specifically, we prove that for all odd characteristic-2 extension degrees $m \geq 23$, their function $C_u$ is not a permutation over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}^3$ for any $u \in \mathbb{F}_{2^m}^*$, resolving the permutation part of their conjecture for sufficiently large fields.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 30 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We systematically analyze a class of hexanomial functions over finite fields of characteristic $2$ proposed by Dillon (2006) as candidates for almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions, significantly extending earlier partial-APN results. For functions over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, where $q=2^n$, of the form $$ F(x)=x(Ax^2+Bx^q+Cx^{2q})+x^2(Dx^q+Ex^{2q})+x^{3q}, $$ we derive necessary conditions on the coefficients $A,B,C,D,E$ for APNness using algebraic number theory and algebraic-geometry methods over finite fields. Our main contribution is a comprehensive case-by-case analysis that excludes large classes of Dillon hexanomials via vanishing patterns of key coefficient polynomials. We identify algebraic obstructions -- including absolutely irreducible components of associated varieties and degree incompatibilities in polynomial factorizations -- that prevent these functions from attaining optimal differential uniformity. These results substantially narrow the search space for new APN functions in this family and provide a framework applicable to other APN candidates. We complement the theory with extensive computations: exhaustive searches over $\mathbb{F}_{2^2}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^4}$, and random sampling over $\mathbb{F}_{2^6}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^8}$, yielding hundreds of APN hexanomials. Complete CCZ-equivalence testing shows that, although many examples occur, they fall into few distinct classes. For $q\in\{2,4\}$, all examples are CCZ-equivalent to the Budaghyan--Carlet family, while in larger dimensions none appear equivalent to that family.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We call a tensor functor $F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ between finite tensor categories $\otimes$-Frobenius if its left and right adjoints are isomorphic as $\mathcal{C}$-bimodule functors. We give several characterizations of this notion -- most notably, $F$ is $\otimes$-Frobenius if and only if the centralizer $Z({}_{F}\!{\mathcal{D}}_{\!F})$ is unimodular. We use them to analyze how actions on module categories behave under pullback along $F$. For perfect functors, we show that twisting a $\mathcal{D}$-module category $\mathcal{M}$ along $F$ preserves exactness, and that pivotality, unimodularity, and sphericality are preserved whenever $F$ is $\otimes$-Frobenius (or, more generally, Frobenius with respect to $\mathcal{M}$). Applications include: (i) explicit criteria for $\otimes$-Frobenius functors arising from bialgebra maps $f\!:\!H'\!\to\!H$ between finite-dimensional Hopf algebras; and (ii) criteria ensuring that objects of internal natural transformations are (symmetric) Frobenius algebras in $Z(\mathcal{C})$. Along the way we show that central tensor functors are Frobenius iff they are $\otimes$-Frobenius and that any tensor functor between separable fusion categories is $\otimes$-Frobenius, answering questions of Flake-Laugwitz-Posur.</p></details>
