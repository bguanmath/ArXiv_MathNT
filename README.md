 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Bruno Kahn &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 40 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the existence of divided powers in étale Chow groups of abelian varieties over a separably closed field, and hence of an integral lift of the Fourier transform, away from the characteristic and up to $2$-torsion. The method is to lift the Deninger-Murre Chow-Künneth projectors to integral ones, and draw consequences. Several techniques used here are new.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that up to isomorphism there are exactly twenty pairs $(C,E)$, where $C$ is a genus-$2$ curve over ${\mathbf C}$, where $E$ is an elliptic curve over ${\mathbf C}$, and where for every integer $n>1$ there is a map of degree $n$ from $C$ to $E$. We also show that the intersection of the Humbert surfaces $H_{n^2}$, for $n$ ranging from 2 to 1811, is empty.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nic Fellini, M. Ram Murty &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a prime $p\equiv 1 \,(\bmod{4})$, let $$ \varepsilon = \frac{1}{2}\left( t + u\sqrt{p}\right) $$ be the fundamental unit of the real quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p})$. In 1951, N. Ankeny, E. Artin, and S. Chowla asked whether $p$ can divide $u$. They suggested that this can never happen and this has since been called the Ankeny--Artin--Chowla (AAC) conjecture. We show that if $\mathfrak{p}$ is the prime above $p$ in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p})$, then the AAC conjecture is false if and only if $$ \varepsilon^{p-1} \equiv 1\, (\bmod{\mathfrak{p}^2}). $$ Thus, the AAC conjecture is related to the existence of number field analogues of Wieferich primes. Therefore, in the second part of this paper, we investigate the infinitude of Wieferich primes in number fields. Subject to Masser's $abc$-conjecture for number fields, we prove that for any fixed $α\in \mathcal{O}_K\setminus\{0\}$ that is not a root of unity, there are infinitely many primes ideals $\mathfrak{p}\subseteq \mathcal{O}_K$ for which $$ α^{N(\mathfrak{p})-1} \not\equiv 1\, (\bmod{\mathfrak{p}^2}). $$ Additionally, we show under the weaker assumption that there are finitely many base-$α$ super-Wieferich primes, and that there are infinitely many base-$α$ non-Wieferich primes. In both cases, we obtain the lower bound $$ \#\left\{\text{prime ideals } \mathfrak{p} : N(\mathfrak{p})\leq x \text{ and } α^{N(\mathfrak{p})-1}\not\equiv 1 \,(\bmod{\mathfrak{p}^2})\right\} \gg_{K, α, \varepsilon} \frac{\log x}{\log\log x} $$ as $x\to \infty$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 31 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a weighted simultaneous Khintchine-type theorem, both convergence and divergence, for all nondegenerate manifolds, which answers a problem posed in [Math. Ann., 337(4):769-796, 2007]. This extends the main results of [Acta Math., 231:1-30, 2023] and [Ann. of Math. (2), 175(1):187-235, 2012] in the weighted set-up. As a by-product of our method, we also obtain a multiplicative Khintchine-type convergence theorem for all nondegenerate manifolds, which is a simultaneous analogue of the celebrated result of Bernik, Kleinbock, and Margulis for dual approximation.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish the convergence theory of multiplicative Diophantine approximation for all non-degenerate, smooth manifolds. We also settle said convergence theory for all affine subspaces satisfying a highly generic and essentially optimal Diophantine condition. This answers a question of Beresnevich and Velani from 2005, while simultaneously sharpening results of Kleinbock and Margulis on the strong extremality of non-degenerate manifolds, and of Kleinbock on the strong extremality of affine subspaces.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Maarten Derickx, Petar Orlić &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime. We study non-constant morphisms $f:X_0(p)_\mathbb \to Y$, where $Y/\mathbb Q$ is a curve of genus $\geq 2$. We prove that for $p<3000$ such an $f$ of degree $d>1$ must be isomorphic to the quotient map $X_0(p)\to X_0^+(p)$. Supported by computational and theoretical evidence, we also conjecture that this is true for all primes $p$. These results allow us to classify all points of degree $\leq 25$ on $X_0(p)$ that come from a map to some curve of genus $\geq 2$. As an application, we were able to determine all curves $X_0(p)$ with infinitely many points of degree $6$ over $\mathbb Q$ except for $p=193$, continuing the previous results on small degree points on $X_0(N)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages, two algorithms, four tables

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate and generalise Levine sequences like A011784, A061892 and A061894 and develop an algebraic theory for them. We thereby also cover other fast growing sequences like A014644, which we call golombic due to their strong ties with Golomb's sequence A001462.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** David Zywina &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any number field $K$ and integer $0\leq r \leq 4$, we prove that there are infinitely many elliptic curves over $K$ of rank $r$. Our elliptic curves are obtained by specializing well-chosen nonisotrivial elliptic curves over the function field $K(T)$. We use a result of Kai, which generalizes work of Green, Tao and Ziegler to number fields, to choose our specializations so that we have control over the bad primes and can perform a $2$-descent to compute ranks.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages, comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and study a class of Hopf algebras $H(G, χ, η, b, c, β)$ which are two-step Ore extensions of a group algebra $\mathbb{K}[G]$. This construction unifies and generalizes some known families of Hopf algebras such as generalized Taft algebras and Hopf algebras related to $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ constructed by Wang, Wu, and Tan. We analyze the ring theoretical properties of these algebras and classify all finite dimensional simple modules over them.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the cluster monomials in non-initial cluster variables are uniquely determined by the Newton polytopes of their $F$-polynomials for skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras. Accordingly, we prove that the $τ$-rigid modules and the left finite multi-semibricks in $τ$-tilting theory are uniquely determined by the Newton polytopes of these modules. The key tools used in the proofs are the left Bongartz completion, $F$-invariant and partial $F$-invariant in the context of cluster algebras and $τ$-tilting theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 58 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we prove motivic versions of the Langlands-Shelstad Fundamental Lemma and Ngô's Geometric Stabilization. To achieve this, we follow the strategy from the recent proof by Groechenig, Wyss and Ziegler which avoided the use of perverse sheaves using instead $p$-adic integration and Tate duality. We make a key use of a construction of Denef and Loeser which assigns a virtual motive to any definable set in the theory of pseudo-finite fields.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 113 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate explicit modular forms of weights $1/2$ and $3/2$-classical, minus, and fermionic theta series-arising from the classical Weil representation associated to $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ via the $2$-cocycles of Rao, Kudla, Perrin, Lion--Vergne and Satake--Takase. We reorganize these forms using (tensor) induction, and subsequently extend our study to the similitude group $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{R})$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 36 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We examine the cell modules for the category of type An webs and their natural cellular forms. We modify the bases of these modules, as described by Elias, to obtain an orthogonal basis of each cell module. Hence, we calculate the determinant of the Gram matrix with respect to such bases. These Gram determinants are given in terms of intersection forms, computed from certain traces of clasps - higher order Jones-Wenzl morphisms. Additionally, the modified basis is constructed using these clasps, and each clasp is constructed using traces of smaller clasps. Elias conjectures a value for these intersection forms and verifies it in types $A_1$, $A_2$ and $A_3$. This paper concludes with a proof of the conjecture in type $A_n$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages, 6 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the Markoff spectrum and the Lagrange spectrum on the Hecke group $\mathbf H_4$. They are identical to the Markoff and Lagrange spectra of the unit circle. The Markoff spectrum on $\mathbf H_4$ is also known as the Markoff spectrum of index 2 sublattices by Vulakh and the Markoff spectrum of 2-minimal forms or $C$-minimal forms by Schmidt. They characterized the spectrum up to the first accumulation point, independently. We show that, after the first accumulation point, both spectra have positive Hausdorff dimension. Then we find gaps in the spectra and give a bound on Hall's ray.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 33 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we first introduce representations of averaging pre-Lie algebras and study their matched pairs, Manin triples, and bialgebra theories. We prove that these three notions are equivalent under certain conditions. Moreover, by introducing averaging operators on quadratic Rota-Baxter pre-Lie algebras, we show that such operators give rise to averaging pre-Lie bialgebras. Then we introduce the notion of admissible classical Yang-Baxter equations in averaging pre-Lie algebras, as well as the relative Rota-Baxter operators on averaging pre-Lie algebras, and show that the relative Rota-Baxter operators on averaging pre-Lie algebras yield symmetric solutions of admissible classical Yang-Baxter equations in averaging pre-Lie algebras. Finally, we show that every averaging pre-Lie bialgebra induces an averaging Lie bialgebra.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a $d$-dimensional Auslander correspondence for $d$-truncated proper connective DG-algebras via $d$-extended module categories. A $d$-truncated proper connective DG-algebra $Γ$ is called Auslander if its $d$-extended module category is a $d$-Auslander extriangulated category. Our main theorem gives a one-to-one correspondence: for any $d$-truncated proper connective DG-algebra $Λ$ whose $d$-extended module category has finitely many indecomposable objects, the DG-endomorphism algebra of an additive generator is Auslander, and conversely every Auslander $d$-truncated proper connective DG-algebra arises in this way.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 75 pages, 10 figures, closest to version to be published in NeurIPS

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Many modern learning tasks require models that can take inputs of varying sizes. Consequently, dimension-independent architectures have been proposed for domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design principles for designing new transferable models. Numerical experiments support our findings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study inequalities involving polynomials and quasimodular forms. More precisely, we focus on the monotonicity of the functions of the form $t \mapsto t^m F(it)$ where $F$ is a quasimodular form and $m > 0$. As an application, we construct infinitely many positive quasimodular forms of level $> 1$. We also give alternative proofs of modular form inequalities used in the proof of optimality of Leech lattice packing and universal optimality of the lattice by Cohn, Kumar, Miller, Radchenko, and Viazovska.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 44 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\varphi$ be the Hörmander--Bernhardsson extremal function, and let $(\pmτ_n)_{n\ge1}$ be its real zeros. Using the recent analytic description of the zero set ${τ_n}$, we prove that the squared zeros $λ_n=τ_n^{2}$ form an admissible sequence in the sense of Quine--Heydari--Song: the heat trace $Θ(t)=\sum_{n\ge1}e^{-λ_n t}$ has a full $t\to0^{+}$ expansion in pure powers of $t^{1/2}$. The proof is based on an analytic normal form $$ λ_n=\Bigl(n+\tfrac12\Bigr)^2+q!\Bigl(\Bigl(n+\tfrac12\Bigr)^{-2}\Bigr), $$ a uniform Taylor expansion in $t$, and a Mellin--Hurwitz zeta analysis of the resulting weighted Gaussian sums. As applications we obtain meromorphic continuation and special-value information for the associated spectral zeta function and zeta-regularized product, sharp large-parameter asymptotics for the canonical product $\prod_{n}(1+z/λ_n)$. In particular, we deduce the conjecture by Bondarenko--Ortega-Cerdà--Radchenko--Seip for the special values of the Dirichlet-type series attached to $\varphi$. We also establish a parity dichotomy: sequences $(τ_n^m)$ are QHS--admissible for even $m$, while for odd $m$ a nonzero $t\log t$ term obstructs admissibility.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 31 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Alpöge--Bhargava--Shnidman showed that even a strengthened \emph{no local obstruction} condition for monogenicity does not force a global power integral basis: in the full spaces of cubic and quartic fields, a positive proportion are non-monogenic yet satisfy this ABS fixed-sign condition. This raises a natural family-level question: does the same phenomenon persist inside one-parameter families, where the local structure varies in a highly constrained way? In this paper we answer this in the negative for the pure fields $K_m=\mathbb Q(α)$ with $α^n=m$ ($n\ge 4$) and $m$ square-free. Writing $g(m)=[\mathcal O_{K_m}:\mathbb Z[α]]$, we prove that the set of square-free $m$ for which $g(m)>1$ but $K_m$ has no ABS local obstruction has natural density $0$. Consequently, in the pure family monogenicity and $α$--monogenicity have the same natural density. The proof isolates a reusable mechanism, which we call the Eisenstein-prime obstruction sieve. The argument is packaged in an abstract template and transfers to other Eisenstein parameter families.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Updated Proposition 1.4. To appear in Acta Arithmetica

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the index of nilpotency relative to certain Hecke operators in spaces of modular forms with integer weight and level $N$ with integer coefficients modulo primes $p$ for $(p, N) \in \{(3, 1), (5, 1), (7, 1), (3, 4)\}$. In these settings, we prove upper bounds on certain indices of nilpotency. As an application of our bounds, we prove infinite families of congruences for $p^t$-core partition functions modulo $p$ for $p\in \{3, 5, 7\}$ and $t\geq 1$, and we prove an infinite family of congruences modulo $3$ for the $r$th power partition function, $p_r(n)$, when $r = 12k$ with $\gcd(k,6) = 1$. We also include conjectures on a function which quantifies degree lowering on powers of the Delta function by the relevant Hecke operators in these settings, and on the index of nilpotency relative to a modification of this degree-lowering function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be prime, and let $p_{[1,p]}(n)$ denote the function whose generating function is $\prod (1-q^n)^{-1}(1 - q^{pn})^{-1}$. This function and its generalizations $p_{[c^{\ell}, d^m]}(n)$ are the subject of study in several recent papers. Let $\ell\geq 5$, let $j\geq 1$, and let $p \in \{2, 3, 5\}$. In this paper, we prove that the generating function for $p_{[1, p]}(n)$ in the progression $β_{p, \ell, j}$ modulo $\ell^j$ with $24β_{p, \ell, j} \equiv p + 1 \pmod{\ell^j}$ lies in a Hecke-invariant subspace of type $\{η(Dz)η(Dpz)F(Dz) : F(z) \in M_{s}(Γ_0(p), χ)\}$ for suitable $D\geq 1$, $s\geq 0$, and character~$χ$. When $p\in \{2, 3, 5\}$, we use the Hecke-invariance of these subspaces proved in [21] to prove, for distinct primes $\ell$ and $m\geq 5$ and $j\geq 1$, congruences of the form $$ p_{[1, p]}\left(\frac{\ell^jm^k n + 1}{D}\right)\equiv 0 \pmod{\ell^j} $$ for all $n\geq 1$ with $m\nmid n$, where $k$ is explicitly computable and depends on the forms in the invariant subspace. Our proofs require adapting and extending analogous level one results on $p(n)$ in [1] and [22] to level $p$.</p></details>

Distinct local descriptions of a (singular) point correspond to distinct choices of $X$, giving rise to families of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs each without a Higgs branch. These local descriptions directly translate into nilpotency relations in the operator product expansions.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper provides a systematic study of symmetry properties for cyclotomic multiple Hurwitz zeta values with multiple variables and parameters by applying the methods of contour integration and the residue theorem. The main contributions are the derivation of explicit symmetry formulas for cyclotomic multiple (Hurwitz) zeta values, which are obtained directly through analytic residue calculations, without reliance on algebraic regularization. As a concrete application, we deduce analogous symmetry theorems for cyclotomic multiple zeta values and cyclotomic multiple $t$-values. The results extend and complement recent symmetry investigations by Charlton and Hoffman, offering completely explicit and regularization-free formulas in the convergent setting. Moreover, the results of this paper can be used to prove the symmetry conjecture for cyclotomic multiple Hurwitz zeta values with multiple variables and a single parameter. Furthermore, several illustrative corollaries and examples are included, and an open problem concerning possible extensions to other variants of multiple zeta values is posed at the conclusion.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A_q$ be the alternating central extension of the q-Onsager algebra, a comodule algebra over the quantum loop algebra of $sl_2$. We classify one-dimensional representations of $A_q$, and show that spin-j K-operators constructed in arXiv:2301.00781 act as K-matrices previously obtained in the literature. Using these K-operators and K-matrices, we construct universal spin-j transfer matrices generating commutative subalgebras in $A_q$. Within a technical conjecture, we derive their fusion hierarchy, the so-called universal TT-relations. On spin-chain representations of $A_q$, we show how the universal transfer matrices evaluate to spin-chain transfer matrices, and as a result we get explicit TT-relations for all values of spins for auxiliary and quantum spaces, any inhomogeneities, and general integrable boundary conditions. In particular, we derive previously conjectured TT-relations. Using the TT-relations, we show that n-th local conserved quantities of the spin-j chains of length N are polynomials of total degree 4Njn in two non-local operators of the q-Onsager algebra. As a result, we give an algorithm of explicit calculation of all local conserved quantities in terms of spin operators. Furthermore, using the universal TT-relations we derive exchange relations between spin-j Hamiltonians and the two non-local operators showing non-trivial symmetries for special boundary conditions, that they commute with all Hamiltonian densities. As another application of our universal TT-relations we propose universal T-system, Y-system and universal TQ-relations for $A_q$, and as a result, universal TQ for the q-Onsager algebra. For diagonal boundary conditions, we also obtain universal TT- and TQ-relations for a degenerate version of $A_q$ known as centrally extended augmented q-Onsager algebra. We finally discuss implications of our results for generalized Gibbs ensemble construction.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Sturm's theorem states that a modular form with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ can only have an explicitly bounded order of vanishing at infinity. This result is one of the most powerful computational tools in the study of modular forms, and has widespread applications to congruences and other kinds of explicit calculations in mathematics and physics. In this paper, we formulate a new ``$p$-adic transfer method" that lifts Sturm-type bounds from one space to another using exclusively non-geometric inputs. As an application, we transfer the Sturm bounds for classical modular forms to the space of quasimodular forms of level one. These bounds are applicable uniformly for quasimodular forms with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$, which extends the non-uniform results for $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ only which can be derived from classical theories. We also discuss the potential for future applications to other quasi- and mixed-weight modular objects, and perhaps even entirely non-modular objects.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the densities of the sets of abundant numbers and of covering numbers, integers $n$ for which there exists a distinct covering system where every modulus divides $n$. We establish that the set $\mathcal{C}$ of covering numbers possesses a natural density $d(\mathcal{C})$ and prove that $0.103230 < d(\mathcal{C}) < 0.103398.$ Our approach adapts methods developed by Behrend and Deléglise for bounding the density of abundant numbers, by introducing a function $c(n)$ that measures how close an integer $n$ is to being a covering number with the property that $c(n) \leq h(n) = σ(n)/n$. However, computing $d(\mathcal{C})$ to three decimal digits requires some new ideas to simplify the computations. As a byproduct of our methods, we obtain significantly improved bounds for $d(\mathcal{A})$, the density of abundant numbers, namely $0.247619608 < d(\mathcal{A}) < 0.247619658$. We also show the count of primitive covering numbers up to $x$ is $O\left( x\exp\left(\left(-\tfrac{1}{2\sqrt{\log 2}} + ε\right)\sqrt{\log x} \log \log x\right)\right)$, which is substantially smaller than the corresponding bound for primitive abundant numbers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 31 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any imaginary quadratic field $K$, the Galois group $G_K$ of its maximal unramified pro-$3$-extension is a Schur $σ$-group. If this has Zassenhaus type $(3,3)$, there are 13 possibilities for the isomorphism class of the finite quotient $G_K/D_4(G_K)$. We prove that for 10 of these 13 cases $G_K$ is either finite or isomorphic to an open subgroup of a form of $\mathop{\rm PGL}_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}_3$. Combined with the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture, or with earlier work on an analogue of the Cohen--Lenstra heuristic for Schur $σ$-groups, this lends credence to the "if" part of a conjecture of McLeman. Using explicit computations of triple Massey products, we also test the heuristic for all imaginary quadratic fields $K$ with $d(G_K)=2$ and discriminant $-10^8 < d_K < 0$ and find a reasonably good agreement.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We evaluate some series with summands involving a single binomial coefficient $\binom{6k}{3k}$. For example, we prove that $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(63k^2+78k+22)8^k}{(2k+1)(6k+1)(6k+5)\binom{6k}{3k}}=\frac{3π}2.$$ Motivated by Galois theory, we introduce the so-called Duality Principle for irrational series of Ramanujan's type or Zeilberger's type, and apply it to find 26 new irrational series identities. For example, we conjecture that \begin{align*}&\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{(32(91\sqrt{33}-523))^{k}}{k^3\binom{2k}k^2\binom{3k}k} \left((91\sqrt{33}+891)k-33\sqrt{33}-225\right) \\&\qquad=320\left(\frac{11}3\sqrt{33}L_{-11}(2)-27L_{-3}(2)\right), \end{align*} where $ L_{d}(2)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{(\frac{d}k)}{k^2}$ for any integer $d\equiv0,1\pmod4$ with $(\frac{d}k)$ the Kronecker symbol.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine the Picard number and the Ulrich complexity of general bidouble covers of the projective plane, providing the first systematic study of Ulrich bundles on non-cyclic abelian covers. For a bidouble plane branched along three smooth curves of degrees $n_1,n_2,n_3$, we show that $ρ(S)=1$ unless $(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ belongs to an explicit list, thereby extending Buium's classical results on double planes to the non-cyclic case. As an application, we determine the range of branch degrees for which Ulrich line bundles could exist. Our method combines the invariant-theoretic decomposition of $H^2(S,\mathbb{Q})$ under the Galois group with cohomological criteria for Ulrich bundles.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study a family of polynomials $$S_n^{(m)}(x):=\sum_{i,j=0}^n\binom ni^m\binom nj^m\binom{i+j}ix^{i+j}\ \ (m,n=0,1,2,\ldots).$$ For example, we show that $$\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}S_k^{(0)}(x)\equiv\frac x{2x-1}\left(1+\left(\frac{1-4x^2}p\right)\right)\pmod p $$ for any odd prime $p$ and integer $x\not\equiv1/2\pmod p$, where $(\frac{\cdot}p)$ denotes the Legendre symbol.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Here we show that the Weil abscissa of the procyclic groups $\prod_{p \in S} \mathbb{Z}_p$ equals $2$ for three sets $S$: (i) the set of primes $p \equiv 1 \bmod 3$, (ii) the set of primes $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$ and (iii) the set of primes $p \equiv 1,3 \bmod 8$. Our argument is based on the observation that integers all of whose prime factors lie in $S$ can be represented by a suitable binary quadratic form, which allows us to use a theorem of Iwaniec to exhibit a minorant for the Weil representation zeta function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study frequency moments of partition statistics arising from Euler products $A(q)=\prod_{r\ge1}(1-q^r)^{-c(r)}$ via a transform that expresses the moment generating functions as $B(q)$ times explicit divisor--sum series determined by $c(r)$. When $A(q)$ is modular (typically an $η$--quotient), this yields (quasi)modular forms whose coefficients can be projected to arithmetic progressions and certified modulo primes by a Sturm bound, giving an effective pipeline for detecting and proving Ramanujan--type congruences for frequency moments. For ordinary partitions we recover and certify several congruences for odd moments in nonzero residue classes (e.g.\ $M_3(7n+5)\equiv 0\pmod7$ and $M_3(11n+6)\equiv 0\pmod{11}$). As a second input, we apply the same pipeline to overpartitions and certify a family of zero--class congruences $M_m^{\overline{\ }}(\ell n)\equiv 0\pmod{\ell}$ (including $m=5,7,11,13$), exhibiting a sharp contrast with the ordinary partition case: no nonzero residue--class congruences are observed for overpartition moments in our scan range. We also demonstrate that filtering the statistic via the Glaisher--character dictionary can itself create new Ramanujan--type progressions, e.g.\ a quadratic twist yields the certified congruence $\widehat{M}^{χ_5}_3(5n+4)\equiv 0\pmod{5}$.</p></details>

More precisely, we characterize completely the set of irrationals $x$ such that $\left|x-\frac{p}{q}\right|<\frac{1}{3q^2}$ has only finitely many rational solutions: their continued fraction is eventually a balanced sequence through a simple coding. As consequence, we show that all such numbers are either quadratic surds or transcendental numbers. In particular, for any algebraic real number $x$ of degree at least $3$ there are infinitely rational numbers $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $\left|x-\frac{p}{q}\right|<\frac{1}{3q^2}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notions of local realizability at a prime and algebraic realizability of an integer sequence. After discussing this notion in general we consider it for the Euler numbers, the Bernoulli denominators, and the Bernoulli numerators. This gives, for example, a dynamical characterization of the Bernoulli regular primes. Algebraic realizability of the Bernoulli denominators is shown at every prime, giving a different perspective on the great diversity of congruences satisfied by this sequence. We show that the sequence of Euler numbers cannot be realized on a nilpotent group, which may explain why it is less hospitable to congruence hunting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By the work of Hernandez-Leclerc, Leclerc-Plamondon, and Keller-Scherotzke, affine graded Nakajima quiver varieties associated with a Dynkin quiver $Q$ admit an algebraic description in terms of modules over the singular Nakajima category $\mathcal{S}$ and a stratification functor to the derived category of $Q$. In this paper, we extend this framework to Nakajima's $n$-fold affine graded tensor product varieties, which allow one to geometrically realize $n$-fold tensor products of standard modules over the quantum affine algebra. We introduce a category of filtrations with splitting of length $n$ of modules over a category and show that it is equivalent to the module category of a triangular matrix category. Applied to the singular Nakajima category, this yields a category $\mathcal{S}^{n\mathrm{-filt}}$ whose modules are parametrized by the points of the $n$-fold tensor product varieties. Generalizing the results of Keller-Scherotzke from $\mathcal{S}$ to $\mathcal{S}^{n\mathrm{-filt}}$, we prove that the stable category of pseudo-coherent Gorenstein projective $\mathcal{S}^{n\mathrm{-filt}}$-modules is triangle equivalent to the derived category of the algebra of $n \times n$ upper triangular matrices over the path algebra of $Q$, and we obtain a corresponding stratification functor.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a new method for combining two cotorsion pairs to obtain an abelian model structure and we apply it to construct and study a new model structure on left $R$-modules over a left coherent ring $R$. Its class of fibrant objects is generated by the weakly Ding injective $R$-modules, a class of modules recently studied by Iacob. We give several characterizations of the fibrant modules, one being that they are the cycle modules of certain acyclic complexes of FP-injective (i.e., absolutely pure) $R$-modules. In the case that $R$ is a Ding-Chen ring, we show that they are precisely the modules appearing as cycles of acyclic complexes of FP-injectives. This leads to a new description of the stable module category of a Ding-Chen ring $R$, by way of modules we call Gorenstein FP-pro-injective. These are modules that appear as a cycle module of a totally acyclic complex of FP-projective-injective modules. As a completely separate application of the new model category method, we show that all complete cotorsion pairs, even non-hereditary ones, lift to abelian models for the derived category of a ring.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In our previous paper with Tudor Pădurariu, we introduced the notion of limit categories for moduli stacks of Higgs bundles and formulated the Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence. These limit categories are expected to provide an effective ``classical limit'' of the categories of D-modules on the moduli stack of bundles, and our formulation links categorical Donaldson-Thomas theory with the geometric Langlands correspondence. In this paper, we prove the above Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence for $\GL_2$ over the locus in the Hitchin base where the spectral curves are reduced. This is the first non-trivial case in which the relevant moduli stacks are not quasi-compact, and the use of limit categories is essential to the formulation and proof of the correspondence. Our approach also outlines a strategy for proving the correspondence in greater generality and explains the current obstructions to such an extension.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>About 40 years ago Jonathan and Peter Borwein discovered the series identity $$ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n(6n)!}{(3n)!(n!)^3} \frac{(A+nB)}{C^{n+1/2}} = \frac{1}{12π} $$ where \begin{align*} A&=1657145277365+212175710912\sqrt{61},\cr B&=107578229802750+13773980892672\sqrt{61},\cr C&=\left(5280(236674+30303\sqrt{61})\right)^3 \end{align*} which adds roughly 25 digits of accuracy per term. They noted that if each of the quadratic irrationals $A$, $B$ and $C$ is replaced by their conjugates, that is, each number $a+b\sqrt{61}$ is changed to $a-b\sqrt{61}$, then the resulting series also converges to a rational multiple of $1/π$. They gave several other examples of quadratic irrational series for $1/π$, and noted that the conjugate series converges to another rational multiple of $1/π$ or in some cases the conjugate series diverges. The purpose of this work is to provide an explanation and classification of such series. Our classification includes Ramanujan's 17 original series, as well as series of the Borweins, Chudnovskys, Sato and others. We extend the classification to genus-zero subgroups $Γ_0(\ell)+$, that is, for each $\ell \in \big\{1,2,3,\ldots,36,38,39,41,42,44,45,46,47,49,50,51,54,55,56,59,60,62,66,69,70, 71,78,87,92,94,95,105,110,119\big\}$ we calculate the Hauptmoduls, associated weight two modular forms, and the corresponding rational and real quadratic irrational series for $1/π$. The classification reveals many interrelations among the different series. For example, we show that the Borweins' series above, and its conjugate, are equivalent by hypergeometric transformation formulas to the level~7 rational series $$ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left\{\sum_{j=0}^n {n \choose j}^2{2j \choose n} {n+j \choose j}\right\} (11895n+1286) \frac{(-1)^n}{22^{3n+3}} = \frac{1}{π\sqrt{7}}. $$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a Kac-Moody group, split over $\mathbb R$. The totally nonnegative part of $G$ and its (ordinary) flag variety $G/B^+$ was introduced by Lusztig. It is known that the totally nonnegative parts of $G$ and $G/B^+$ have remarkable combinatorial and topological properties. In this paper, we consider the totally nonnegative part of the $J$-twisted flag variety $G/{}^J B^+$, where ${}^J B^+$ is the Borel subgroup opposite to $B^+$ in the standard parabolic subgroup $P_J^+$ of $G$. The $J$-twisted flag varieties include the ordinary flag variety $G/B^+$ as a special case. Our main result show that the totally nonnegative part of $G/{}^J B^+$ decomposes into cells, and the closure of each cell is a regular CW complex. This generalizes the work of Galashin-Karp-Lam \cite{GKL22} and the joint work of Bao with the first author \cite{BH24} for ordinary flag varieties. As an application, we deduce that the totally nonnegative part of the double flag variety $G/B^+ \times G/B^-$ with respect to the diagonal $G$-action has similar nice properties. We also establish some connections between the totally nonnegative part of the double flag with the canonical basis of the tensor product of a lowest weight module with a highest weight module of $G$. As another application, we show that the link of identity in a totally nonnegative reduced double Bruhat cell of $G$ is a regular CW complex. This generalizes the work of Hersh \cite{Her14} on the link of $U_{\geq0}^-$ and gives a positive answer to an open question of Fomin and Zelevinsky.</p></details>

Using this Hecke equivariance, we show that the sesquiharmonic Maass functions, whose images under the hyperbolic Laplace operator are the Faber polynomials $J_n$ of the $j$-function, form a Hecke system analogous to $J_n$.

Assuming stability of universal Koszulity under this quadratic gluing, we obtain that universal Koszulity of $H^\bullet(G_{K_1},\mathbb F_p)$ and $H^\bullet(G_{K_2},\mathbb F_p)$ implies universal Koszulity of $H^\bullet(G_K,\mathbb F_p)$. As a concrete application, we prove a composita stability theorem for certain Pythagorean fields whose maximal pro-$2$ Galois groups decompose as free pro-$2$ products of Demuškin groups and free factors. For suitable composita $K = K_1K_2$ of such fields, the mod-$2$ Galois cohomology ring $H^\bullet(G_K(2),\mathbb F_2)$ remains quadratic and universally Koszul. This provides large classes of fields, built from local, global, and Pythagorean base fields by admissible extensions and composita, whose maximal pro-$p$ Galois groups have universally Koszul cohomology, and yields inverse Galois obstructions: any finitely generated pro-$p$ group with nonquadratic or non-universally Koszul mod-$p$ cohomology cannot occur as the maximal pro-$p$ Galois group of a field in these families.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Lagrange spectrum $L$ is the set of finite values of the best approximation constants $k(α)=\limsup_{|p|,|q|\to \infty}|q(qα-p)|^{-1}$, where $α\in \mathbb{R}\setminus \mathbb{Q}$. It is a classical result that the pairs $(p,q)$ attaining these approximation constants arise from the convergents $(p_n,q_n)$ of the continued fraction of $α$. Consequently, $k(α)=\limsup_{n\to\infty}|q_n(q_nα-p_n)|^{-1}$. Moreira proved that the function $d(t)=HD(L\cap(-\infty,t))$ where $HD$ denotes Hausdorff dimension, is continuous. Second Lagrange spectra are defined analogously to the classical Lagrange spectrum, but are associated with the problem of approximating an irrational number $α$ by rational numbers $\frac{p}{q}$ that are not convergents of its continued fraction expansion. Two natural definitions arise depending on whether rational multiples $(p,q)=(kp_n,kq_n),k\geq 2$ which represent the same rational numbers as convergents, are allowed or excluded. Based on this distinction, Moshchevitin introduced two second Lagrange spectra, denoted $L_2$ and $L_2^*$. We prove that the function $d_2(t)=HD(L_2\cap (-\infty,t))$ is continuous, whereas $d_2^*(t)=HD(L_2^*\cap (-\infty,t))$ is discontinuous and assumes only the values 0 and 1.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study universal solutions to reflection equations with a spectral parameter, so-called K-operators, within a general framework of universal K-matrices - an extended version of the approach introduced by Appel-Vlaar. Here, the input data is a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra $H$, its comodule algebra $B$ and a pair of consistent twists. In our setting, the universal K-matrix is an element of $B\otimes H$ satisfying certain axioms, and we consider the case $H$ is the quantum loop algebra for $sl_2$, and $B={\cal A}_q$ is the alternating central extension of the $q$-Onsager algebra. Considering tensor products of evaluation representations of $H$ in "non-semisimple" cases, the new set of axioms allows us to introduce and study fused K-operators of spin-$j$; in particular, to prove that for all $j\in\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{N}$ they satisfy the spectral-parameter dependent reflection equation. We provide their explicit expression in terms of elements of the algebra ${\cal A}_q$ for small values of spin-$j$. The precise relation between the fused K-operators of spin-$j$ and evaluations of a universal K-matrix for ${\cal A}_q$ is conjectured based on supporting evidences. We finally discuss implications of our results on the K-operators for quantum integrable systems.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For coprime $p,q\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$, the triplet vertex operator algebra $W_{p,q}$ is a non-simple extension of the universal Virasoro vertex operator algebra of central charge $c_{p,q}=1-\frac{6(p-q)^2}{pq}$, and it is a basic example of a vertex operator algebra appearing in logarithmic conformal field theory. Here, we give a new construction of $W_{p,q}$ different from the original screening operator definition of Feigin-Gainutdinov-Semikhatov-Tipunin. Using our earlier work on the tensor category structure of modules for the Virasoro algebra at central charge $c_{p,q}$, we show that the simple modules appearing in the decomposition of $W_{p,q}$ as a module for the Virasoro algebra have $\mathrm{PSL}_2$-fusion rules and generate a symmetric tensor category equivalent to $\mathrm{Rep}\mathrm{PSL}_2$. Then we use the theory of commutative algebras in braided tensor categories to construct $W_{p,q}$ as an appropriate non-simple modification of the canonical algebra in the Deligne tensor product of $\mathrm{Rep}\mathrm{PSL}_2$ with this Virasoro subcategory. As a consequence, we show that the automorphism group of $W_{p,q}$ is $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$. We also define a braided tensor category $\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ consisting of modules for the Virasoro algebra at central charge $c_{p,q}$ that induce to untwisted modules of $W_{p,q}$. We show that $\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ tensor embeds into the $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-equivariantization of the category of $W_{p,q}$-modules and is closed under contragredient modules. We conjecture that $\mathcal{O}_{c_{p,q}}^0$ has enough projective objects and is the correct category of Virasoro modules for constructing logarithmic minimal models in conformal field theory.</p></details>

This conjecture provides a candidate set for the unitary dual, constructed from Arthur representations. For classical groups, we develop an explicit algorithm to generate this candidate set. Evidence for its exhaustiveness includes compatibility with the known generic unitary dual, unramified unitary dual, and low-corank representations. As further support, we verify the conjecture for the unitary dual of the exceptional group of type $G_2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a formalism of Hochschild (co)-homology for $\mathcal{D}$-cap modules on smooth rigid analytic spaces based on the homological tools of Ind-Banach $\mathcal{D}$-cap modules. We introduce several categories of $\mathcal{D}$-cap bimodules for which this theory is well-behaved. Among these, the most important example is the category of diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complexes. We give an explicit calculation of the Hochschild complex for diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complexes, and show that the Hochschild complex of $\mathcal{D}$-cap is canonically isomorphic to the de Rham complex of $X$. In particular, we obtain a Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence converging to the Hochschild cohomology groups of $\mathcal{D}$-cap. We obtain explicit formulas relating the Hochschild cohomology and homology of a given diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complex.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The primary objective of this section is to demonstrate that the actual pseudorandom measures of our construction are significantly smaller than the theoretical upper bounds derived from the Weil theorem. Regarding the family of sequences, we note that the construction $E_{f,g,h}$ allows for a large variety of sequences by choosing different triples of polynomials. While the detailed analysis of the cross-correlation measure of such a family is a challenging problem and lies beyond the scope of the present paper, the structure of the construction suggests that sequences generated by different polynomials will remain nearly orthogonal. Indeed, since each sequence is built from distinct Legendre symbol sequences with proven low correlation, their combinations are expected to maintain the same level of independence.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a $g$-dimensional abelian variety defined over a number field $F$. It is conjectured that the set of ordinary primes of $A$ over $F$ has positive density, and this is known to be true when $g=1, 2$, or for certain abelian varieties with extra endomorphisms. In this paper, we extend the family of abelian varieties whose sets of ordinary primes have positive density. Specifically, we show that if the endomorphism algebra of $A$ contains a number field $K$ of degree $g$, then under certain conditions on the fields $F$ and $K$, the set of ordinary primes of $A$ over $F$ has positive density. This includes $\mathrm{GL}_2$-type abelian varieties over $\mathbb{Q}$ (resp. quadratic number fields) of dimension $q$ or $2q$ (resp. $q$) for any rational prime $q$. The proof is carried out in the general setting of compatible systems of Galois representations, and as a consequence, it also implies a positive density result for the sets of ordinary primes of certain modular forms of weight $2$.</p></details>

The result was later reproved by a different method by G. Harcos (undergraduate thesis, 1996, Hungarian).

It is a classical fact, known since the 1950s, that $X_c$ is uncountable for $c>3$ and countable for $c<3$. However, the cardinality of $X_3$ does not appear to be present in the literature. We prove that $X_3$ is uncountable.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study additively indecomposable quadratic forms over real biquadratic and simplest cubic fields. In particular, we show that over these fields, we can always find such a classical form in 2 variables, which differs from the situation for forms over integers. Moreover, for some cases, we derive a lower bound on the number of classical, additively indecomposable binary quadratic forms up to equivalence.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A recent construction of polylogarithms on Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus in arXiv:2306.08644 is based on a flat connection assembled from single-valued non-holomorphic integration kernels that depend on two points on the Riemann surface. In this work, we construct and prove infinite families of bilinear relations among these integration kernels that are necessary for the closure of the space of higher-genus polylogarithms under integration over the points on the surface. Our bilinear relations generalize the Fay identities among the genus-one Kronecker-Eisenstein kernels to arbitrary genus. The multiple-valued meromorphic kernels in the flat connection of Enriquez are conjectured to obey higher-genus Fay identities of exactly the same form as their single-valued non-holomorphic counterparts. We initiate the applications of Fay identities to derive functional relations among higher-genus polylogarithms involving either single-valued or meromorphic integration kernels.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a metric-dependent geometric variant of factorization homology in conformally flat Riemannian geometry for $d \geq 2$. We introduce a symmetric monoidal category of germs of d-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and orientation-preserving conformal open embeddings, and its full monoidal subcategory generated by flat disks. A conformally flat $d$-disk algebra is a symmetric monoidal functor from this disk category to a target category; in this paper we take the target to be $\mathrm{IndHilb}$, the ind-category of Hilbert spaces, which provides a mathematical formulation of $d$-dimensional conformal field theories. The (1-categorical) left Kan extension of an $\mathrm{IndHilb}$-valued conformally flat $d$-disk algebra defines a metric-dependent invariant of conformally flat manifolds. Under suitable positivity and continuity assumptions, we prove that its value on the standard sphere $(S^d,g_{\mathrm{std}})$ reproduces the sphere partition function of the associated conformal field theory. For $d>2$, we construct nontrivial $\mathrm{IndHilb}$-valued conformally flat $d$-disk algebras from unitary representations of $\mathrm{SO}^+(d,1)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By extracting coefficients from Wilf-Zeilberger pairs with respect to auxiliary parameters, we discover many nontrivial hypergeometric series involving harmonic numbers. In particular, we obtain a rapidly convergent series for the depth-two multiple zeta value $ζ(5,3)$, which appears to be the first result of its kind in the literature. We also experiment with the Hilbert-Poincare series attached with a WZ-seed and conjecture that it admits a remarkably simple form, suggesting the presence of an underlying graded algebra structure behind WZ-seeds.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce minimal Richardson orbits and pseudo-polarizations for nilpotent orbits in classical Lie algebras of types B, C, and D. For any nilpotent orbit, we classify all minimal Richardson orbits containing it and thereby determine the associated pseudo-polarizations. We prove that the corresponding Spaltenstein varieties are smooth and pure dimensional, with iterated orthogonal/isotropic Grassmannian fibrations. As an application, we extend the seesaw property and duality of Fu-Ruan-Wen from Richardson orbits to all special orbits in types B and C.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove Pólya's conjecture for the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian on annular domains. Our approach builds upon and extends the methods we previously developed for disks and balls. It combines variational bounds, estimates of Bessel phase functions, refined lattice point counting techniques, and a rigorous computer-assisted analysis. As a by-product, we also derive a two-term upper bound for the Dirichlet eigenvalue counting function of the disk, improving upon Pólya's original estimate.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study square functions for extension operators over finite-type, planar curves endowed with the Euclidean arclength measure. We prove new results for curves of the form $(T,φ(T))$ where $φ(T)$ is a polynomial of degree at least 2. This includes new estimates for such curves given by monomials $φ(T) = T^k$ for $k \geq 3$ which are uniform over all local fields whose characteristic is coprime to \(k\). Key to our approach is a systematic analysis of the second order differencing polynomial and its geometry in local fields.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 47 pages; new version contains corrections and clarifications

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $N$ be a prime and $φ$ be a Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform for the Hecke congruence subgroup $Γ_0(N)$ in $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{R})$. Let $Ω$ be an adelic compactum and let $Ω_N$ be its projection to $Γ_0(N) \backslash \mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{R}) / \mathrm{SO}(n)$. For any prime $n$, we prove sub-baseline bounds for the sup-norm of $φ$ restricted to $Ω_N$. Conditionally on GRH, we generalise this result to all $n \geq 2$. The methods involve a new reduction theory with level structure, based on generalisations of Atkin-Lehner operators.</p></details>

> **Comment:** The manuscript is 58 pages and comments are welcome. This is a preview of a somewhat expanded version of the notes to appear in the Oberwolfach Seminars series published by Birkhäuser (the numbering will be stable across the two versions)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>These are notes from the lectures I gave at the Oberwolfach seminar `Tensor Triangular Geometry and Interactions' which was held in October 2025. The aim of these notes is to give an introduction to tensor triangular geometry, for both small and large categories, through the lens of lattice theory. We do not try to be exhaustive and this is reflected in both the content and the bibliography. For instance we are quite light on triangulated preliminaries, especially for compactly generated categories. The first three sections treat the essentially small case and conclude with a tensor triangular proof of Thomason's theorem computing the spectrum of the perfect complexes on a quasi-compact and quasi-separated scheme. The last section treats the compactly generated case. This final section is somewhat experimental and contains some new thoughts.</p></details>
