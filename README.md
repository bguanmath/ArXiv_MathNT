 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Lidia Angeleri Hügel &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** This is a survey on recent joint work with Rosanna Laking, Francesco Sentieri, Jan Šťovíček, and Jorge Vitória

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a left artinian ring A, we study the lattice torsA of torsion pairs in the category of finitely generated A-modules by considering an isomorphic lattice formed by certain closed sets in a topological space associated to A, the Ziegler spectrum of the unbounded derived category of ModA. Torsion pairs in torsA turn out to be adjacent if and only if the associated closed sets are related by an operation which is induced by mutation of cosilting complexes. We describe this operation from several perspectives and present a number of applications in the case when A is a finite dimensional algebra.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 58 pages; added stable fixed points for Gr(4,10)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms of cluster algebras and show that their induced action on the g-vectors can be realized by tropicalising their action on the homogeneous $\hat{y}$ (or $\mathcal{X}$) variables of a chosen initial cluster. This perspective allows us to interpret the action on g-vectors as a change of coordinates in the tropical setting. Focusing on Grassmannian cluster algebras, we analyse tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms in detail. We derive tropical analogues of the braid group action and the twist map on both g-vectors and tableaux. We introduce the notions of unstable and stable fixed points for quasi-automorphisms, which prove useful for constructing cluster monomials and non-real modules, respectively. As an application, we demonstrate that the counts of prime non-real tableaux with a fixed number of columns in $\mathrm{SSYT}(3, [9])$ and $\mathrm{SSYT}(4, [8])$, arising from the braid group action on stable fixed points, are governed by Euler's totient function. Furthermore, we apply our findings to scattering amplitudes in physics, providing a novel interpretation of the square root associated with the four-mass box integral via stable fixed points of quasi-automorphisms of the Grassmannian cluster algebra $\CC[\Gr(4,8)]$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** She Yang, Xiao Zhong &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In \cite{NZ25}, the authors resolved the rational function analogue of the finiteness results for greatest common divisors of iterates of polynomials established in \cite{HT17}. These results may be viewed as dynamical generalizations of a classical problem concerning upper bounds for the greatest common divisors (GCDs) of two integer sequences studied by Bugeaud, Corvaja, and Zannier. The most delicate case arises when the maps involved are automorphisms, where the methods of \cite{NZ25} and \cite{HT17} rely heavily on Diophantine approximation and asymptotic analysis. In the present paper, we develop an alternative approach to the automorphism case. This method is more powerful, allowing us to give complete answers to the further questions posed in \cite{HT17}. In particular, we strengthen the main theorem of \cite{HT17} and provide an alternative proof of the main theorem of \cite{NZ25} in the automorphism setting. Moreover, we relate this dynamical GCD problem to a special case of a higher-dimensional generalization of the Dynamical Mordell--Lang Conjecture proposed by Junyi Xie. We establish this generalized conjecture when the dynamics arise from algebraic group actions. In addition, we resolve the corresponding special case associated with dynamical GCD questions when the maps involved are polynomials.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 35 pages. Accepted for publication in Journal of Number Theory

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we consider singular systems of linear forms over global function fields of class number one and give an upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the set of singular systems of linear forms by constructing an appropriate Margulis height function on the space of lattices over global function fields.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13728v2'>2410.13728</a>\]&nbsp; **Highest weight categories and stability conditions**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Alessio Cipriani, Jon Woolf &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** We clarified that formula (1) on page 8 holds for highest weight categories and not for all Deligne finite hearts (thanks to A. Bondal who pointed out the error). We added Section 5 on properly stratified categories (thanks to the referee for suggesting this extension)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Highest weight categories are an abstraction of the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras introduced by Cline, Parshall and Scott in the late 1980s. There are by now many characterisations of when an abelian category is highest weight, but most are hard to verify in practice. We present two new criteria - one numerical in terms of the Grothendieck group, and one in terms of Bridegland stability conditions - which are easier to verify. The stability criterion naturally generalises to a characterisation of properly stratified categories. The numerical criterion implies a criterion of Green and Schroll for when modules over a monomial algebra are highest weight.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18126v1'>2602.18126</a>\]&nbsp; **A new class of Correlations insisting on Ramanujan expansions**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Giovanni Coppola &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** A T-S Correlation is a kind of unexpected wonder for its many simple properties, compare the paper, see the Abstract

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Studying Correlations with Ramanujan Expansions, we arrive to present the new class of, say, Two-Seasons Correlations, abbr. T-S, as a natural set expressing some of the features of, say, H-L-like Correlations; these are the ones that mimic the H-L ($=$Hardy-Littlewood) Correlation with shift $2k$, needed to study $2k-$twin primes following Hardy \& Littlewood Conjecture. After introducing the $3-$Hypotheses Correlations in a previous paper, we add two other, very natural, hypotheses: the fifth is a technical one, simplifying calculations; but the fourth is called 'Parity', since it deals with the parity of natural numbers we play with. In particular, we may build (devoting to this 'our mainstream', here) a single Correlation that satisfies these '5 Axioms', thus a T-S one, that 'entangles two different Correlations' (whence Two-Seasons: T-S) depending on $a$ ($=$ the shift) parity. For $a$ even, our 'Artifact' mimics the H-L Correlation, in fact $a=2k$; but, while H-L Correlation is 'negligible', say, on $a$ odd, our Artifact seems to compare at least in the order of magnitude to H-L Correlation on $a$ even, being linked to another additive problem. Namely, on $a$ even, the Artifact 'counts', say, classic solutions to: $p_1+a=p_2$, in odd primes $p_1,p_2$; while, on $a$ odd, it 'counts' solutions to: $p_1+a=2^j p_2$, again with odd primes $p_1,p_2$ and with $j\in \N$ (satisfying the natural arithmetic constraints). More in general, our T-S Correlations 'entangle' two different Diophantine equations.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Lucien Hennecart, Shivang Jindal &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** v1: 35 pages, comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By work of Davison and Meinhardt, the cohomological Hall algebra of a symmetric quiver with potential admits a geometrically defined filtration (the perverse filtration) whose associated graded is a supercommutative algebra. In the case of the triple quiver of a quiver with the canonical cubic potential, which corresponds to the preprojective algebra of the quiver via dimensional reduction, there is an additional filtration (the less perverse filtration), which is defined more generally for cohomological Hall algebras of suitably geometric 2-Calabi-Yau categories in work of Davison. In this paper, we show that the degenerations of the cohomological Hall algebras of preprojective algebras and more generally 2-Calabi-Yau categories with respect to the less perverse filtration is isomorphic to the enveloping algebra of the current Lie algebra of the BPS Lie algebra. This result applies in particular to CoHAs of local systems on Riemann surfaces and Higgs bundles on smooth projective curves. We extend this description to deformations of the cohomological Hall algebra obtained via torus actions on the arrows of the quiver and deformed canonical cubic potentials via the deformed dimensional reduction of Davison-Pădurariu. Last, we use our results to compare the less perverse filtration on CoHAs of preprojective algebras with the order filtration on the Maulik-Okounkov Yangian, via the comparison isomorphism of Botta-Davison and Schiffmann-Vasserot.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17197v2'>2602.17197</a>\]&nbsp; **On endomorphism algebras of silting complexes over hereditary abelian categories**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Wei Dai, Changjian Fu, Liangang Peng &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{E}$ be the class of finite-dimensional algebras isomorphic to endomorphism algebras of silting complexes over hereditary abelian categories. It is proved that the class $\mathcal{E}$ is closed under taking idempotent quotients, idempotent subalgebras and $τ$-reduction. We also show that the proper class consisting of shod algebras is also closed under these operations. In addition, several classic classes of algebras -- including laura, glued, weakly shod algebras -- are proved to be closed under idempotent quotients, thereby generalizing a known result originally established for specific idempotents.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish Large Galois orbits conjectures for points of unlikely intersections of curves in $Y(1)^n$, upon assumptions on the intersection of such curves with the boundary $X(1)^n\backslash Y(1)^n$, in the Zilber-Pink setting.

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18017v1'>2602.18017</a>\]&nbsp; **Modules of Jacobi forms of degree two of small levels**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hiroki Aoki, Tomoyoshi Ibukiyama &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The purpose of this paper is to describe explicitly the modules of (Siegel-)Jacobi forms of degree two of index one of any scalar valued weight with respect to some congruence subgroups of small levels $N\leq 4$. Such a structure for the full Siegel modular group as a module over scalar valued Siegel modular forms of even weight has been explicitly given by T.~Ibukiyama. There we used an explicit structure theorem of rings of scalar valued Siegel modular forms by Igusa and that of vector valued Siegel modular forms of weight $\det^k\, \Sym^2$ by T. Satoh and T. Ibukiyama. On the other hand, for levels $N=2$, $3$, $4$, ring structures of scalar valued case have been also known by H. Aoki and T. Ibukiyama and $\det^k \Sym^2$-valued case by H. Aoki. In this paper, by merging these results, we give the same sort of simple structure theorems on modules of Jacobi forms of degree of two of index one for level $2$, $3$ and $4$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sheng-Yang Kevin Ho &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 21 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix a nonzero level $\mathfrak{n} \in \mathbb{F}_q[T]$. In this paper, we first establish a function field analogue of Ligozat's theorem, which serves as our main result and provides a criterion for Drinfeld modular units on the Drinfeld modular curve $X_0(\mathfrak{n})$. We further conjecture that this criterion characterizes all Drinfeld modular units; we verify the conjecture in the cases of prime power level and of level equal to the product of two primes. Second, as an application of Drinfeld modular units, we investigate the rational cuspidal divisor class group $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{n})$ of $X_0(\mathfrak{n})$. We construct an injective map $g$ from the group of degree $0$ rational cuspidal divisors on $X_0(\mathfrak{n})$ to the group of Drinfeld modular units on $X_0(\mathfrak{n})$ tensored with $\mathbb{Q}$ over $\mathbb{Z}$. As a result, we establish an explicit upper bound for the exponent of $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{n})$ for general level $\mathfrak{n}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 66 pages, 4 appendices

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the coherent Springer sheaf and its parabolic analogues are concentrated in cohomological degree $0$, as predicted by Ben-Zvi-Chen-Helm-Nadler, Zhu, Emerton-Gee-Hellmann, Hansen, and others. More generally, we show that the universal trace functor for a mixed partial affine Hecke category is right t-exact with respect to the exotic t-structure given by Bezrukavnikov-Mirković's noncommutative Springer resolution, and left t-exact with respect to the monoidally dual t-structure. To this end, we construct an explicit complex computing the universal trace functor for certain monoidal categories over quotient stacks.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00271v2'>2501.00271</a>\]&nbsp; **Generalized finite and affine $W$-algebras in type $A$**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Dong Jun Choi, Alexander Molev, Uhi Rinn Suh &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math-ph &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 31 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct a new family of affine $W$-algebras $W^k(λ,μ)$ parameterized by partitions $λ$ and $μ$ associated with the centralizers of nilpotent elements in $\mathfrak{gl}_N$. The new family unifies a few known classes of $W$-algebras. In particular, for the column-partition $λ$ we recover the affine $W$-algebras $W^k(\mathfrak{gl}_N,f)$ of Kac, Roan and Wakimoto, associated with nilpotent elements $f\in\mathfrak{gl}_N$ of type $μ$. Our construction is based on a version of the BRST complex of the quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction. We show that the application of the Zhu functor to the vertex algebras $W^k(λ,μ)$ yields a family of generalized finite $W$-algebras $U(λ,μ)$ which we also describe independently as associative algebras.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Masoud Kamgarpour, Daniel S. Sage &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** The manuscript has been thoroughly revised and substantially rewritten. In addition, we have included a major new theorem on inverse differential Galois theory. The title has been changed since the previous submission

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A fundamental theorem of Katz \cite{Katz87} determines the differential Galois groups of rank $n$ connections on algebraic curves with slope $r/n$ at a singularity, where $\gcd(r,n)=1$. We extend this result to $G$-connections, where $G$ is a simple algebraic group and the slope is $r/h$, with $h$ the Coxeter number of $G$ and $\gcd(r,h)=1$. This allows us to compute the differential Galois groups of a broad class of $G$-connections that have been central to recent advances in the geometric Langlands program and the Deligne--Simpson problem -- namely, Coxeter connections, generalised Frenkel--Gross connections, and Airy connections. We apply our results to inverse differential Galois theory by giving uniform and explicit constructions of $G$-connections whose differential Galois groups realise all reductive subgroups of maximal degree.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** David Z. Gershnik, Alexander J. Lewis, Pietro Paparella &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.SP &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An invertible matrix is called a Perron similarity if it diagonalizes an irreducible, nonnegative matrix. Each Perron similarity gives a nontrivial polyhedral cone, called the spectracone, and polytope, called the spectratope, of realizable spectra (thought of as vectors in complex Euclidean space). A Perron similarity is called ideal if its spectratope coincides with the conical hulls of its rows. Identifying ideal Perron similarities is of great interest in the pursuit of the longstanding nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem. In this work, it is shown that the character table of a finite group is an ideal Perron similarity. In addition to expanding ideal Perron similarities to include a broad class of matrices, the results unify previous works into a single, theoretical framework. It is demonstrated that the spectracone can be described by finitely-many group-theoretic inequalities. When the character table is real, we derive a group-theoretic formula for the volume of the projected Perron spectratope, which is a simplex. Finally, an implication for further research is given.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-19 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Vladimir Gurvich, Mariya Naumova &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A number $N$ is a triangular number if it can be written as $N = t(t + 1)/2$ for some nonnegative integer number $t$. A triangular number $N$ is called square if it is a perfect square, that is, $N = d^2$ for some integer number $d$. Square triangular numbers were characterized by Euler in 1778 and are in one-to-one correspondence with the so-called near-isosceles Pythagorean triples $(k,k+1,l)$, where $k^2 + (k+1)^2 = l^2$. A quadratic number is the product $Π= Π(k,j) = k(k+1)(k+j)(k+j+1)$ for some nonnegative integer numbers $k$ and $j$. By definition, it is the product of two triangular numbers and 4. Quadratic number $Π$ and the corresponding pair $(k,j)$ are called square if $Π$ is a perfect square. Clearly, $(k,j)$ is square if both triangular numbers $k(k+1)/2$ and $(k+j)(k+j+1)/2$ are perfect squares. Yet, there exist infinitely many other square quadratic numbers. We construct polynomials $j_i(k)$ of degree $i$ with positive integer coefficients satisfying equations: $k + j_{2 \ell}(k) + 1 = k [a_\ell k^\ell + \dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 +1 = (k+1) [b_\ell k^\ell + \dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ and \newline $k + j_{2\ell+1}(k) + 1 = k(k+1) [a_\ell k^\ell + \dots + a_1 k + a_0]^2 + 1 = [b_{\ell+1} k^{\ell+1}+b_\ell k^\ell + \dots + b_1 k + b_0]^2$ for some positive integer $\ell$ and some coefficients $a_i, b_j$, $i=0, \ldots, \ell, j=0, \ldots, \ell+1$. All the obtained pairs $(k, j_i(k))$ are square. We conjecture that the products of square triangular numbers and pairs $(k, j_i(k))$ cover all quadratic squares. Additionally, we identify pairs of intervals of successive integers with equal sums of squares.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the entropy of the Serre functor $\mathbb{S}$ in the partially wrapped Fukaya category of a graded surface $Σ$ with stops is given by the function sending $t \in \mathbb{R}$ to $ h_t(\mathbb{S}) = (1-\min Ω)t$, for $t\geq 0$, and to $h_t(\mathbb{S})=(1-\max Ω)t$, for $t\leq 0$, where $Ω= \{\frac{ω_1}{m_1} \ldots, \frac{ω_b}{m_b},0\}$, and $ω_i$ is the winding number of the $i$th boundary component $\partial_iΣ$ of the surface with $b$ boundary components and $m_i$ stops on $\partial_i Σ$. It then follows that the upper and lower Serre dimensions are given by $1-\min Ω$ and $1-\max Ω$, respectively. Furthermore, in the case of a finite dimensional gentle algebra $A$, we show that a Gromov-Yomdin-like equality holds by relating the categorical entropy of the Serre functor of the perfect derived category of $A$ to the logarithm of the spectral radius of the Coxeter transformation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by the $y$-ification of HOMFLY--PT homology by Gorsky and Hogancamp, and the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-action of Gorsky, Hogancamp, and Mellit, we construct $y$-ifications of Khovanov homology and its equivariant versions within Bar-Natan's framework for tangles, and define an action of the element $e$ in $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ on these $y$-ifications. We then prove that our construction is compatible with the previous ones under Rasmussen's spectral sequence from HOMFLY--PT homology to Khovanov homology. Our construction is elementary and well suited to diagrammatic manipulations and algorithmic implementations. As a result, we verify directly that these additional structures distinguish pairs of knots with identical Khovanov homology and HOMFLY--PT homology, in particular the Conway knot and the Kinoshita--Terasaka knot.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for the number of joint orbits of random tuples of commuting permutations. In the uniform sampling case this generalizes the classic CLT of Goncharov for the number of cycles of a single random permutation. We also consider the case where tuples are weighted by a factor other than one, per joint orbit. We view this as an analogue of the Ewens measure, for tuples of commuting permutations, where our CLT generalizes the CLT by Hansen. Our proof uses saddle point analysis, in a context related to the Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotics and the theorem of Meinardus, but concerns a multiple pole situation. The proof is written in a self-contained manner, and hopefully in a manner accessible to a wider audience. We also indicate several open directions of further study related to probability, combinatorics, number theory, an elusive theory of random commuting matrices, and perhaps also geometric group theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give an introduction to partially wrapped Fukaya categories of surfaces with orbifold singularities. Dissecting an orbifold surface $\mathbf S$ into polygons, certain dissections give rise to formal generators, inducing a triangulated equivalence between the derived Fukaya category of $\mathbf S$ and the perfect derived category of a graded associative algebra. This provides a geometric means for obtaining associative algebras -- conjecturally all -- which are derived equivalent to skew-gentle algebras. We include a new perspective on the partially wrapped Fukaya category of an orbifold disk which serves as a local model for the Fukaya categories of general orbifold surfaces. This perspective yields an equivalence between the perfect derived category of a quiver of type $\mathrm D_{n+1}$ and the perfect derived category of a graded quiver of type $\widetilde{\mathrm A}_{n-1}$, the latter being equipped with quadratic zero relations and a nontrivial A$_\infty$ structure. This equivalence elucidates the relationship between skew-gentle algebras and orbifold surfaces, and the role of deformation theory in this relationship.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Following methods used by A. Dugas for investigating derived equivalent pairs of (weakly) symmetric algebras, we apply them in a specific situation, obtaining new deep results concerning iterated mutations of symmetric periodic algebras. More specifically, for any symmetric algebra $Λ$, and an arbitrary vertex $i$ of its Gabriel quiver, one can define mutation $μ_i(Λ)$ of $Λ$ at vertex $i$ via silting mutation of the stalk complex $\La$. Then $μ_i(Λ)$ is again symmetric, and we can iterate this process. We want to understand the order of $μ_i$, in case the vertex $i$ is $d$-periodic, i.e. the simple module $S_i$ associated to $i$ is periodic of period $d$ (with respect to the syzygy). The main result of this paper shows that then $μ_i$ has order $d-2$, that is $μ_i^{d-2}(Λ)\congΛ$ (modulo socle), under some additional assumption on the (periodic) projective-injective resolution of $S_i$. Besides, we present briefly some consequences concerning arbitrary periodic vertex and give few sugestive examples showing that this property should hold in general, i.e. without restrictions on the periodic projective resolution.</p></details>

Specializing to commutative noetherian rings, we show that this assignment induces a bijection on the respective equivalence classes. Furthermore, we prove in the same setting that the n-silting modules always correspond to a tilting complex, that is, the associated t-structure is of derived type. We use this to exhibit new examples of tilting complexes in the setting of Commutative Algebra and also to show that the finite type property for n-silting modules, as formulated by Mao, can in general fail.</p></details>

We define and study a "Tate-Shafarevich cohomology set" that governs the obstruction to the local-global principle for $m$-atic twists.

> **Comment:** 154 pages,

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present the first algorithm for computing class groups and unit groups of arbitrary number fields that provably runs in probabilistic subexponential time, assuming the Extended Riemann Hypothesis (ERH). Previous subexponential algorithms were either restricted to imaginary quadratic fields, or relied on several heuristic assumptions that have long resisted rigorous analysis. The heart of our method is a new general strategy to provably solve a recurring computational problem in number theory (assuming ERH): given an ideal class $[\mathfrak{a}]$ of a number field $K$, sample an ideal $\mathfrak b \in [\mathfrak{a}]$ belonging to a particular family of ideals (e.g., the family of smooth ideals, or near-prime ideals). More precisely, let $\mathcal{S}$ be an arbitrary family of ideals, and $\mathcal{S}_B$ the family of $B$-smooth ideals. We describe an efficient algorithm that samples ideals $\mathfrak b \in [\mathfrak{a}]$ such that $\mathfrak b \in \mathcal{S} \cdot\mathcal{S}_B$ with probability proportional to the density of $\mathcal{S}$ within the set of all ideals. The case where $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of prime ideals yields the family $\mathcal{S}\cdot\mathcal{S}_B$ of near-prime ideals, of particular interest in that it constitutes a dense family of efficiently factorable ideals. The case of smooth ideals $\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{S}_B$ regularly comes up in index-calculus algorithms (notably to compute class groups and unit groups), where it has long constituted a theoretical obstacle overcome only by heuristic arguments.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite VOA, not necessarily rational or self-dual. In this paper, we establish various versions of the sewing-factorization (SF) theorems for conformal blocks associated to grading-restricted generalized modules of $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$ (where $N\in\mathbb N$). In addition to the versions announced in the Introduction of [GZ23], we prove the following coend version of the SF theorem: Let $\mathfrak F$ be a compact Riemann surface with $N$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points, and let $\mathfrak G$ be another compact Riemann surface with $K$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points. Assign $\mathbb W\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes N})$ and $\mathbb X\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes K})$ to the incoming marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. For each $\mathbb{M} \in \mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes R})$, assign $\mathbb{M}$ and its contragredient $\mathbb M'$ to the outgoing marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. Denote the corresponding spaces of conformal blocks by $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb W)$ and $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak{G}}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes\mathbb X)$. Let the $\mathfrak X$ be the $(N+K)$-pointed surface obtained by sewing $\mathfrak F$, $\mathfrak G$ along their outgoing marked points. Then the sewing of conformal blocks-proved to be convergent in [GZ25a]-yields an isomorphism of vector spaces $$\int^{\mathbb{M}\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes R})}\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb{W})\otimes_{\mathbb C} \mathscr T_{\mathfrak G}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes \mathbb X)\simeq\mathscr T_{\mathfrak X}^*(\mathbb W\otimes \mathbb X)$$ We also discuss the relationship between conformal blocks and the modular functors defined using Lyubashenko's coend/construction.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a unified integral framework based on the Fourier-Laplace transform evaluated along a vertical line in the complex plane. By identifying the moment-generating function (MGF) of a random variable with the weights of these integrals, we first establish a general expression for complex fractional moments valid for any random variable with a MGF. Applying this formula to the Gaussian distribution, we recover a global integral representation for the reciprocal Gamma function that unifies it with its reflection. We formalize the underlying operator as the Parabolic Mellin Transform, a holomorphic alternative to the classical Mellin transform that avoids strips of convergence by mapping the vertical line to a parabolic contour. This general framework leads to new meromorphic representations for the Hurwitz and Riemann zeta functions that are valid throughout the critical strip, as well as reformulations of the Riemann hypothesis and the Lindelof hypothesis.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 31 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The golden sieve, a self-referential deletion process on increasing sequences of positive integers, was introduced by the author in 2002 (OEIS A099267). At each step, a pointer read from the working sequence designates which element to remove. Applied to the natural numbers, the sieve is governed by the golden ratio and recovers the Wythoff partition. We develop the theory of the golden sieve on arithmetic progressions and reveal new structural properties. The survivor sequence is a hiccup sequence in the sense of Fokkink and Joshi, whose gaps take exactly two consecutive values, selected by a rule that depends on the sequence itself. The resulting partition satisfies a Fraenkel-type complementary equation, and the gap word is Sturmian in the base case. A double sieve variant, where both pointer and target are removed at each step, yields three-way partitions of the integers. On perfect squares, the hiccup rule becomes doubly self-referential: the gap at step $n$ is controlled by whether $n$ is the square of a survivor index, so the sequence governs its own gaps through its squared values. A bootstrap argument yields the precise asymptotic growth of the survivors. We also introduce the extraction sieve $\mathcal{C}_{j,y,z}$, a family of processes that repeatedly extract and delete elements from the bottom of an infinite sequence. On $\mathbb{N}$, this sieve produces the $(j,1,y,z)$-hiccup sequence of Fokkink--Joshi, tautologically. Thus the ``silver sieve'' $\mathcal{C}_{1,3,2}$ on $\mathbb{N}$ is simply the Bosma--Dekking--Steiner $(1,1,3,2)$-hiccup with slope $1+\sqrt{2}$. On arithmetic progressions $a\mathbb{N}+b$, the sieve produces the new $(j,\,a{+}b,\,ay,\,az)$-hiccup via an affine action on parameter space, providing an algebraic bridge between sieves and hiccup sequences.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study skein modules of 3-manifolds by embedding them into the Hilbert spaces of 4d ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theories. When the 3-manifold has reduced holonomy, we present an algorithm to determine the dimension and the list of generators of the skein module with a general gauge group. The analysis uses a deformation preserving ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry to express the dimension as a sum over nilpotent orbits in its Lie algebra. We find that the dimensions often differ between Langlands-dual pairs beyond the A-series, for which we provide a physical explanation involving chiral symmetry breaking and 't Hooft operators. We also relate our results to the structure of $\mathbb{C}^*$-fixed loci in the moduli space of Higgs bundles. This approach helps to clarify the relation between the gauge-theoretic framework of Kapustin and Witten with other versions of the geometric Langlands program, explains why the dimensions of skein modules do not exhibit a TQFT-like behavior, and provides a physical interpretation of the skein-valued curve counting of Ekholm and Shende.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Perverse schobers are categorifications of perverse sheaves. In prior work we constructed a perverse schober on a partial compactification of the stringy Kähler moduli space (SKMS) associated by Halpern-Leistner and Sam to a quasi-symmetric representation of a reductive group. When the group is a torus the SKMS corresponds to the complement of the GKZ discriminant locus (which is a hyperplane arrangement in the quasi-symmetric case shown by Kite). We show here that a suitable variation of the perverse schober we constructed provides a categorification of the associated GKZ hypergeometric system in the case of non-resonant parameters. As an intermediate result we give a description of the monodromy of such "quasi-symmetric" GKZ hypergeometric systems.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This manuscript provides a substantial revision and a significant refocusing of the earlier preprint arXiv:2308.04284. The current version removes the applications to sequenceability to prioritize the development of anticoncentration inequalities in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and provides a more detailed comparison with the existing literature

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we investigate the probability distribution of the sum $Y$ of $\ell$ independent identically distributed random variables taking values in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Our main focus is the regime of small values of $\ell$, which is less explored compared to the asymptotic case $\ell \to \infty$. Starting with the case $\ell=3$, we prove that if the distributions of the $Y_i$ are uniformly bounded by $λ< 1$ and $p > 2/λ$, then there exists a constant $C_{3,λ} < 1$ such that $$ \max_{x \in \mathbb{Z}_p} \mathbb{P}[Y = x] \leq C_{3,λ}λ. $$ Moreover, when the distributions are uniformly separated from $1$, the constant $C_{3,λ}$ can be made explicit. By iterating this argument, we obtain effective anticoncentration bounds for larger values of $\ell$, yielding nontrivial estimates already in small and moderate regimes where asymptotic results do not apply.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by the question of defining a $p$-adic string worldsheet action in genus one, we define a Laplacian operator on the Tate curve, and study its Green's function. We show that the Green's function exists. We provide an explicit formula for the Green's function, which turns out to be a non-Archimedean counterpart of the Archimedean Green's function on a flat torus. In particular, it turns out that this Green's function recovers the Néron local height function for the Tate curve in the $p\to\infty$ limit, when the $j$-invariant has odd valuation. So this non-Archimedean height function now acquires a physics meaning in terms of the large $p$ limit of a non-Archimedean conformal field theory two point function on the Tate curve, as well as a direct analytic interpretation as a Green's function, on the same footing as in the Archimedean place.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Littlewood conjecture, proven by Konyagin and McGehee-Pigno-Smith in the 1980s, states that if $A\subset \mathbb{Z}$ is a finite set of integers with $\lvert A\rvert=N$ then $\| \widehat{1_A}\|_1\geq c\log N$ for some absolute constant $c > 0$. We explore what structure $A$ must have if $\| \widehat{1_A}\|_1\leq K\log N$ for some constant $K$. Under such an assumption we prove, for instance, that $A$ contains a subset $A'\subseteq A$ with $\lvert A\rvert \geq N^{0.99}$ such that $\lvert A'+A'\rvert \ll K^{O(1)}\lvert A'\rvert$. As a consequence, for any $k\geq 3$, if $N$ is sufficiently large depending on $k$ and $K$, then $A$ must contain an arithmetic progression of length $k$. A byproduct of our analysis is a (slightly) improved bound for the constant $c$.</p></details>

Secondly, we demonstrate that the maximal potentially abelian quotient of $G_λ$ is independent of $λ$ in a strong sense.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We use Hensel minimality, a non-Archimedean analog of o-minimality, to study several questions around transcendental number theory, unlikely intersections, and differential fields in a non-Archimedean setting. In particular, we focus on $p$-adic exponentiation and Tate uniformization on $\mathbb{C}_p$, which we show live in a Hensel minimal structure on $\mathbb{C}_p$. We start by constructing a large collection of derivations on Hensel minimal fields that respect definable functions, which we then apply to the $p$-adic Schanuel conjecture. We also study properties of local definability in analogy to work of Wilkie, and show that $p$-adic Schanuel implies a uniform version of itself. For Tate uniformization we show a strong closure property when blurring, and deduce that $\mathbb{C}_p$ with the blurred Tate uniformization is quasiminimal. Finally, we prove a result on $p$-adic density of likely intersections for powers of elliptic curves.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The celebrated Harish-Chandra's integrability theorem states that the distributional character of an irreducible smooth representation of a p-adic group $G(F)$ is integrable, that is represented by an $L^1_{loc}(G(F))$ function. Here $F$ is a non-Archimedean local field of characteristic $0$ and $G$ is a reductive algebraic group defined over $F$. In this paper we focus on cuspidal representations of $GL_n(F)$ for a field $F$ of positive characteristic. We show that in this case the integrability holds under the hypothesis of existence of desingularization of (certain) algebraic varieties in positive characteristics. Furthermore, in the case $char(F)>n/2$ we establish the regularity of such characters unconditionally.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 50p

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove dimension bounds on the jet schemes of the variety of nilpotent matrices (and of related varieties) in positive characteristic. This result has applications to the analytic properties of the Chevalley map that sends a matrix to its characteristic polynomial. We show that our dimension bound implies, under the assumption of existence of resolution of singularities in positive characteristic, that the Chevalley map pushes a smooth compactly supported measure to a measure whose density function is $L^t$ for any $t<\infty$. We also prove this analytic property of the Chevalley map, unconditionally, when the characteristic of the field exceeds $n/2$. The zero characteristic counterpart of this result is an important step in the proof of the celebrated Harish-Chandra's integrability theorem. In a sequel work [AGKSb], we show that also in positive characteristic, this analytic statement implies Harish-Chandra's integrability theorem for cuspidal representations of the general linear group.</p></details>

The purpose of this article is twofold: first, we prove a finiteness result for A-motivic cohomology; second, under a weight assumption, we show that the source and the target of the regulator have the same dimension. It came as a surprise to the author that the image of this regulator may fail to have full rank, thereby preventing an analogue of Beilinson's celebrated conjecture from holding in our setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $ψ$ be a continuous decreasing function defined on all large positive real numbers. We say that a real $m\times n$ matrix $A$ is $ψ$-Dirichlet if for every sufficiently large real number $t$ one can find $\mathbf{p} \in \mathbb{Z}^m$, $\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{Z}^n\setminus\{\mathbf{0}\}$ satisfying $\|A\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{p}\|^m< ψ(t)$ and $\|\mathbf{q}\|^n<t$. By removing a technical condition from a partial zero-one law proved by Kleinbock-Strömbergsson-Yu, we prove a zero-one law for the Lebesgue measure of the set of $ψ$-Dirichlet matrices provided that $ψ(t)<1/t$ and $tψ(t)$ is increasing. In fact, we prove the zero-one law in a more general situation with the monotonicity assumption on $tψ(t)$ replaced by a weaker condition. Our proof follows the dynamical approach of Kleinbock-Strömbergsson-Yu in reducing the question to a shrinking target problem in the space of lattices. The key new ingredient is a family of carefully chosen subsets of the shrinking targets studied by Kleinbock-Strömbergsson-Yu, together with a short-range mixing estimate for the associated hitting events. Our method also works for the analogous weighted problem where the relevant supremum norms are replaced by certain weighted quasi-norms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove conjectures of Zamolodchikov and Belavin-Belavin in Liouville conformal field theory (CFT), which are generalisations of the celebrated Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov equations known as the higher equations of motion. Algebraically, these equations give examples of non-zero singular states in Virasoro modules, which is a relatively rare phenomenon in the physical study of CFT. In probability theory, these equations and their variants have been instrumental in the rigorous derivation of the structure constants of Liouville CFT in the unit disc. The proof builds on a previous work of ours studying the analytic continuation of the Poisson operator of Liouville theory. The main novelty is that this operator admits poles on the Kac table, and the higher equations of motions are obtained via a residue computation.</p></details>

For $0\le r\le\min\{m,n\}$, we apply the orbit harmonics method to the finite matrix loci $\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r}$ of rook placements with exactly $r$ rooks, yielding a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n\times\mathfrak{S}_m$-module $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We find one signed and two sign-free graded character formulae for $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We also exhibit some applications of these formulae, such as proving a concise presentation of $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$, and proving some module injections and isomorphisms. Some of our techniques are still valid for involution matrix loci.</p></details>

For such schemes, we show that Fourier-Mukai equivalences on the special fibers can be lifted to the canonical lifts. We also prove that the relative Fourier-Mukai partners of the canonical lifts are in bijection with the Fourier-Mukai partners of the special fibers.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study constraints imposed by four-dimensional unitarity (formalised as graded unitarity in recent work by the first author) on possible ${\mathcal W}_3$ vertex algebras arising from four-dimensions via the SCFT/VOA correspondence. Under the assumption that the $\mathfrak{R}$-filtration is a weight-based filtration with respect to the usual strong generators of the vertex algebra, we demonstrate that all values of the central charge other than those of the $(3,q+4)$ minimal models are incompatible with four-dimensional unitarity. These algebras are precisely the ones that are realised by performing principal Drinfel'd--Sokolov reduction to boundary-admissible $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ affine current algebras; those affine algebras were singled out by a similar graded unitarity analysis in \cite{ArabiArdehali:2025fad}. Furthermore, these particular vertex algebras are known to be associated with the $(A_2,A_q)$ Argyres--Douglas theories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We interpret the structure of the adele class space of the rationals--and specifically its Riemann sector--as the natural monoidal extension of the Picard group of the arithmetic curve $\overline{\mathrm{Spec} \mathbb Z}$. We identify the elements of this space with torsion-free rank-1 abelian groups $L$ endowed with rigidifying data. In the Riemann sector, this data corresponds to a norm, extending the classical notion of metrized line bundles in Arakelov geometry. For the full adele class space, we replace the norm with a group morphism to $\mathbb R$ and a combinatorial datum: a parametrization of the roots of unity associated with the character dual of $L$. We show that the product of adeles is represented geometrically by the tensor product of these rank-1 groups and their rigidifying structures. The resulting monoid space generalizes the Picard group to the full adelic context by incorporating the singular strata required for the spectral realization of $L$-functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the lattice $\mathbf{tors}(A)$ of torsion pairs in the category $\mathrm{mod}(A)$ of finitely generated modules over an artinian ring $A$. It was shown by the authors in previous work that $\mathbf{tors}(A)$ is isomorphic to a lattice formed by certain closed sets, called maximal rigid, in the Ziegler spectrum of the unbounded derived category $\mathrm{D}(A)$ of $A$. Moreover, the structure of this lattice is described by an operation on maximal rigid sets which encompasses (the dual of) silting mutation. In this paper we provide an explicit description of this operation and we discuss how it is reflected in the lattice $\mathbf{tors}(A)$. We establish a bijection between the wide intervals in $\mathbf{tors}(A)$ and the closed rigid sets in the Ziegler spectrum of $\mathrm{D}(A)$. Moreover, we show that the arrows in the Hasse quiver of $\mathbf{tors}(A)$ correspond to the closed rigid sets that are almost complete, or equivalently, that can be completed to a maximal rigid set in exactly two ways. Our results are most interesting in the case when $A$ is a finite dimensional algebra. In fact, we generalise results by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten, with an important difference: not every point in a maximal rigid set is mutable. We use the topology on the Ziegler spectrum to determine the mutable points. In the last section of the paper we illustrate our results by the example of a finite dimensional algebra arising from a triangulation of an annulus.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is devoted to the theory of $GL_n({\mathbb Z})$-conjugacy classes of regular integer $n\times n$ matrices. Such a matrix is $GL_n({\mathbb Q})$-conjugate to the companion matrix of its characteristic polynomial. But the set of $GL_n({\mathbb Z})$-conjugacy classes of regular integer matrices with a fixed characteristic polynomial $f$ is usually nontrivial (finite if $f$ has simple roots, infinite if $f$ has multiple roots). It is in 1:1-correspondence to a subsemigroup of a certain quotient semigroup of the commutative semigroup of full lattices in the algebra ${\mathbb Q}[t]/(f)$. In its first part, the paper gives a survey on old and new results on full lattices and orders in a finite dimensional commutative ${\mathbb Q}$-algebra with unit element and on induced semigroups. In its longer second part, the paper applies this theory to many examples, essentially all cases with $n=2$, many cases with $n=3$ and two cases with arbitrary $n$, the case with $n$ different integer eigenvalues and the case of a single $n\times n$ Jordan block.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a stability theory for minimal projective resolutions of $\mathbf{P}$-modules, where $\mathbf{P}$ is a finite metric poset. On the module side, we introduce the \emph{Galois transport distance}, defined by factoring two modules through a common ``apex'' poset via pairs of Galois insertions and measuring the maximal displacement in the index poset. This construction generalizes the interleaving distance in both the classical one-parameter and multiparameter settings, and yields an extended metric on isomorphism classes of $\mathbf{P}$-modules. On the homological side, we define a bottleneck distance between minimal projective resolutions by matching indecomposable projectives degreewise, with contractible cones playing the role of diagonal terms. Our main theorem shows that this resolution-level bottleneck distance is always bounded above by the Galois transport distance, providing a metric stability result formulated entirely at the level of modules and their minimal projective resolutions. We then treat persistence as an application. Passing to the interval poset and a kernel construction, we interpret persistence diagrams as minimal projective resolutions of kernel modules and obtain a corresponding stability inequality. In the one-parameter case this recovers classical bottleneck stability, while in the multiparameter setting it extends naturally to signed diagrams arising from minimal projective resolutions. Via a general relationship between minimal projective resolutions and Möbius inversion, these results can be interpreted as a stability theorem for Möbius homology, while remaining entirely phrased in the language of projective resolutions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the decomposition of real numbers into sums of Lüroth sets, which are defined by numbers whose Lüroth expansions have prescribed digit constraints. We establish several results on the congruence modulo 1 of sums of Lüroth sets, including summands with digits bounded above, below, and combinations of the two. We also analyse the Hausdorff dimension of Lüroth sets and their sums. The results extend classical findings on continued fractions to Lüroth expansions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article studies the compatibility of Koenig's notion of an exact Borel subalgebra of a quasi-hereditary or, more generally, standardly stratified algebra with taking idempotent subalgebras or quotients. As an application, we provide bounds for the multiplicities of indecomposable projectives in the principal blocks of BGG category $\mathcal{O}$ having basic regular exact Borel subalgebras.</p></details>

> **Comment:** The combinatorics has been changed to make it more accessible to those with a background in Fock spaces. Includes a new ordering on diagrams which vastly simplifies a number of proofs

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We settle a long-standing problem in the theory of Hecke algebras of complex reflection groups by constructing many (graded) integral cellular bases of these algebras. As applications, we explicitly construct the simple modules of Ariki's categorification theorem and prove unitriangularity of decomposition matrices over arbitrary fields, we also prove Martin-Woodcock's conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that for non-conjugate subgroups $G_1$ and $G_2$ of a finite group $G$ there exists an extension of $G$ (by a finite group) in which the pre-images of $G_1$ and $G_2$ are not isomorphic. This allows us to show that $\mathbb Z$-coset equivalent subgroups of a finite group are not necessarily isomorphic, answering a question of Dipendra Prasad. We also indicate connections to profinite rigidity, anabelian geometry, mapping class groups, and non-arithmetic lattices in Lie groups.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-17 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gaurab Bardhan, Nipen Saikia &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we prove some new \(q\)-series identities connecting \(4\)-regular partitions and partitions with distinct even parts with largest part being odd. We also define three new partition functions with distinct even parts except the largest part which is even, and prove identities connecting the three partitions with \(4\)-regular partitions. Moreover, we also offer some congruence for the three newly defined partitions.</p></details>
