 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yucong Du, Xin Huang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Added Theorem 1.2; enhenced the main result on the refined Brou\'e conjecture by removing the assumption $p\equiv 1$ (mod 4) for the group $\tilde{S}^-_n$

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Kleshchev and Livesey proved the existence of RoCK $p$-blocks for double covers of symmetric and alternating groups over large enough coefficient rings. They proved that RoCK blocks of double covers are Morita equivalent to standard ``local" blocks via bimodules with endopermutation source. Based on this, Kleshchev and Livesey proved that these RoCK blocks are splendidly Rickard equivalent to their Brauer correspondents. The analogous result for blocks of symmetric groups, a theorem of Chuang and Kessar, was an important step in Chuang and Rouquier ultimately proving Brou\'e's abelian defect group conjecture for symmetric groups. In this paper we show that the Morita and splendid Rickard equivalences constructed by Kleshchev and Livesey descend to the ring $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p$-adic integers, hence prove Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'e's abelian defect group conjecture for these RoCK blocks.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime number, $K$ a number field that contains the $p$-th root of unity $\zeta_p$, $d$ a $p$-power-free integer and $L=K(\sqrt[p]{d})$. Let $E/K$ be an elliptic curve with full $p$-torsion and $S,T \in E(K)[p]$ be the generators. Define the cocycle $\xi_d : \mathrm{Gal}(\overline{K}/K) \to E$ by $$ \xi_d (\sigma)= \begin{cases} O, & \text{if } \sigma(\sqrt[p]{d})=\sqrt[p]{d}, \newline kS, & \text{if } \sigma(\sqrt[p]{d})=\zeta_p^k\sqrt[p]{d}, \end{cases} $$ and denote by $H_S^d$ the twist of $E$ corresponding to the cocycle $\xi_d$. In this paper we construct generators $z$ and $w$ of the function field $K(H_S^d)$ and give a model of the twist $$ H_S^d\,:\, \alpha_{1}z^p+\alpha_2z^{p-2}w+\dotso+\alpha_{\frac{p+1}{2}}zw^{\frac{p-1}{2}}+\beta w^p+\gamma=0.$$ We also obtain that the twist $H_S^d$ is everywhere locally solvable only for finitely many integers $d$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 16 pages, 1 figure Introduction, title changed, minor reorganization

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an odd prime $p$, we realize the trivial representation of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z})$ on the free $\mathbb{Z}/p^n \mathbb{Z}$-module of rank one as a subquotient of a direct sum of symmetric power representations (twisted by appropriate powers of the determinant) of rank strictly greater than one. The proof eventually reduces to establishing some novel supercongruences for hypergeometric polynomials.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Mohamad N. Nasser, Mohammad Y. Chreif, Malak M. Dally &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that any complex local representation of the flat virtual braid group, $FVB_2$, into $GL_2(\mathbb{C})$, has one of the types $\lambda_i: FVB_2 \rightarrow GL_2(\mathbb{C})$, $1\leq i\leq 12$. We find necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee the irreducibility of representations of type $\lambda_i$, $1\leq i\leq 5$, and we prove that representations of type $\lambda_i$, $6\leq i\leq 12$, are reducible. Regarding faithfulness, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for representations of type $\lambda_6$ or $\lambda_7$ to be faithful. Moreover, we give sufficient conditions for representations of type $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, or $\lambda_4$ to be unfaithful, and we show that representations of type $\lambda_i$, $i=3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12$ are unfaithful. We prove that any complex homogeneous local representations of the flat virtual braid group, $FVB_n$, into $GL_{n}(\mathbb{C})$, for $n\geq 2$, has one of the types $\gamma_i: FVB_n \rightarrow GL_n(\mathbb{C})$, $i=1, 2$. We then prove that representations of type $\gamma_1: FVB_n \rightarrow GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ are reducible for $n\geq 6$, while representations of type $\gamma_2: FVB_n \rightarrow GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ are reducible for $n\geq 3$. Then, we show that representations of type $\gamma_1$ are unfaithful for $n\geq 3$ and that representations of type $\gamma_2$ are unfaithful if $y=b$. Furthermore, we prove that any complex homogeneous local representation of the flat virtual braid group, $FVB_n$, into $GL_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$, for all $n\geq 4$, has one of the types $\delta_i: FVB_n \rightarrow GL_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$, $1\leq i\leq 8$. We prove that these representations are reducible for $n\geq 10$. Then, we show that representations of types $\delta_i$, $i\neq 5, 6$, are unfaithful, while representations of types $\delta_5$ or $\delta_6$ are unfaithful if $x=y$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Maxim van den Berg, Matthias Christandl, Vladimir Lysikov, Harold Nieuwboer, Michael Walter, Jeroen Zuiddam &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Tensors are fundamental in mathematics, computer science, and physics. Their study through algebraic geometry and representation theory has proved very fruitful in the context of algebraic complexity theory and quantum information. In particular, moment polytopes have been understood to play a key role. In quantum information, moment polytopes (also known as entanglement polytopes) provide a framework for the single-particle quantum marginal problem and offer a geometric characterization of entanglement. In algebraic complexity, they underpin quantum functionals that capture asymptotic tensor relations. More recently, moment polytopes have also become foundational to the emerging field of scaling algorithms in computer science and optimization. Despite their fundamental role and interest from many angles, much is still unknown about these polytopes, and in particular for tensors beyond $\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$ and $\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$ only sporadically have they been computed. We give a new algorithm for computing moment polytopes of tensors (and in fact moment polytopes for the general class of reductive algebraic groups) based on a mathematical description by Franz (J. Lie Theory 2002). This algorithm enables us to compute moment polytopes of tensors of dimension an order of magnitude larger than previous methods, allowing us to compute with certainty, for the first time, all moment polytopes of tensors in $\mathbb{C}^3\otimes\mathbb{C}^3\otimes\mathbb{C}^3$, and with high probability those in $\mathbb{C}^4\otimes\mathbb{C}^4\otimes\mathbb{C}^4$ (which includes the $2\times 2$ matrix multiplication tensor). We discuss how these explicit moment polytopes have led to several new theoretical directions and results.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We generalize Reiner--Saliola--Welker's well-known but mysterious family of *$k$-random-to-random shuffles* from Markov chains on symmetric groups to Markov chains on the Type-$A$ Iwahori--Hecke algebras. We prove that the family of operators pairwise commutes and has eigenvalues that are polynomials in $q$ with non-negative integer coefficients. Our work generalizes work of Reiner--Saliola--Welker and Lafreni\`ere for the symmetric group, and simplifies all known proofs in this case.</p></details>

> **Comment:** any comment is welcome! accepted for publication in Mathematische Nachrichten (2025)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $S$ be a subset of $\overline{\mathbb Z}$, the ring of all algebraic integers. A polynomial $f \in \mathbb Q[X]$ is said to be integral-valued on $S$ if $f(s) \in \overline{\mathbb Z}$ for all $s \in S$. The set $\text{Int}_{\mathbb Q}(S,\overline{\mathbb Z})$ of all integral-valued polynomials on $S$ forms a subring of $\mathbb Q[X]$ containing $\mathbb Z[X]$. We say that $\text{Int}_{\mathbb Q}(S,\overline{\mathbb Z})$ is trivial if $\text{Int}_{\mathbb Q}(S,\overline{\mathbb Z}) = \mathbb Z[X]$, and nontrivial otherwise. We give a collection of necessary and sufficient conditions on $S$ in order $\text{Int}_{\mathbb Q}(S,\overline{\mathbb Z})$ to be nontrivial. Our characterizations involve, variously, topological conditions on $S$ with respect to fixed extensions of the $p$-adic valuations to $\overline{\mathbb Q}$; pseudo-monotone sequences contained in $S$; ramification indices and residue field degrees; and the polynomial closure of $S$ in $\overline{\mathbb Z}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb{F}$ be an algebraically closed field and $G$ be an almost quasi-simple group. An important problem in representation theory is to classify the subgroups $H<G$ and $\mathbb{F} G$-modules $L$ such that the restriction $L\downarrow_H$ is irreducible. This problem is a natural part of the program of describing maximal subgroups in finite classical groups. In this paper we investigate the case of the problem where $G$ is the Schur's double cover of alternating or symmetric group.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yotam Shomroni &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 40 pages, 13 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Every word $w$ in $F_r$, the free group of rank $r$, induces a probability measure (the $w$-measure) on every finite group $G$, by substitution of random $G$-elements in the letters. This measure is determined by its Fourier coefficients: the $w$-expectations $E_w[\chi]$ of the irreducible characters of $G$. For every finite group $G$, every stable character $\chi$ of $G\wr S_n$ (trace of a finitely generated $FI_G$-module), and every word $w\in F_r$, we approximate $E_w[\chi]$ up to an error term of $O(n^{-\pi(w)})$, where $\pi(w)$ is the primitivity rank of $w$. This generalizes previous works by Puder, Hanany, Magee and the author. As an application we show that random Schreier graphs of representation-stable actions of $G\wr S_n$ are close-to-optimal expanders. The paper reveals a surprising relation between stable representation theory of wreath products and not-necessarily connected Stallings core graphs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The stable category of modules over the algebra of a finite group with coefficients in a field is a compactly generated tensor triangulated category, that has been studied extensively in representation theory. In this paper, we provide a plethora of infinite groups G, for which the category of kG-modules (where k is a commutative coherent ring of finite global dimension) admits a monoidal model structure, in the sense of Hovey, whose associated homotopy category is a compactly generated tensor triangulated category. To that end, we use a technique recently introduced by the authors, which is based on Kropholler's operation LH and the second author's operation {\Phi}.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Major revision toward computability. Some references to this paper in my other works may still reflect the v1 version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that only finitely many Shimura curves can have gonality bounded by a given number, and we study the computability of this finite set. Motivated by the relation between hyperellipticity (that is, gonality 2) and the vanishing of the modified diagonal cycle, we conjecture that such vanishing occurs for only finitely many Shimura curves. We establish several finiteness and classification results toward this conjecture and, as a by-product, obtain explicit examples of curves with vanishing modified diagonal cycles. Our computations are based on modular form data from the database \textsf{LMFDB}, and some of them are carried out using the computer algebra system \textsf{Sage}.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kazuki Hiroe &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 108 pages. Several typos are corrected. Index and Notation pages are added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unfolding singular points in linear differential equations is a classical technique for studying the properties of irregular singularities by relating them to regular singularities. In this paper, we propose a general framework for unfolding unramified irregular singularities of meromorphic connections on the trivial principal $G$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. One of our main results is the description of the unfolding of singularities in terms of deformations of their moduli spaces. We show that every moduli space of irreducible meromorphic $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ can be deformed into a moduli space of irreducible Fuchsian $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. Furthermore, we study the unfolding of additive Deligne-Simpson problems, in which the unfolding of irregular singularities naturally generates a family of such problems. As an application of our main result, we prove that a Deligne-Simpson problem for $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities admits a solution if and only if every unfolded Deligne-Simpson problem in the family admits a simultaneous solution. We also provide a combinatorial and diagrammatic framework of the unfolding process in terms of spectral types and unfolding diagrams. Finally, we address a conjecture proposed by Oshima concerning the existence of irreducible $G$-connections that realize prescribed spectral types and their unfoldings. Our main result gives an affirmative answer to this conjecture.</p></details>

Furthermore, we introduce two functors, inspired by the categorification of the $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence, in Banach and locally analytic versions respectively. We then compute the sheaves associated with the representations appearing in our sequence. As an application, we show that all proper quotients of the universal unitary completion of a supercuspidal representation have finite length.</p></details>

In the end we discuss the existence of model structures for relative homological algebra for unbounded complex under the relative (Ab.4$^*$)-$k$ condition, and present a variety of examples where our results apply.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p>0$ be a prime, $k$ a field of characteristic $p$ and $G$ and elementary abelian $p$-group of order $q = p^n$. Let $W$ be an indecomposable $kG$-module of dimension 2 and define $V_i=S^{i-1}(W^*)$ for each $i=1 \ldots q$. We show that $V_2 \otimes V_i \cong V_{i+1} \oplus V_{i-1}$ provided $i$ is not divisible by $p$, and that $V_2 \otimes V_p$ is indecomposable if $n>1$. Our results generalise results of Almkvist and Fossum for representations of cyclic groups of order $p$. We show how our results give formulae for the direct sum decomposition of $V_i \otimes V_j$ for $i<p$ and $j<j$ modulo summands projective to $\bigoplus_{r=0}^{p-1}V_{rp}$ and conjecture that these formulae extend to the case $i<q$ and $j<q$.

In this paper, we study a category which we call Deligne--Lusztig category $\mathcal{O}$ and whose definition is similar to category $\mathcal{O}$. We use this to construct a collection of representations of $\mathbf{G}(\mathbb{F}_q)$ which we call the tilting representations. They form a generating collection of integral projective representations of $\mathbf{G}(\mathbb{F}_q)$. Finally we compute the character of these representations and relate their expression to previous calculations of Lusztig and we then use this to establish a conjecture of Dudas--Malle.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a split connected reductive over a non-archimedean local field $k$. In this paper we give a description of the depth-$r$ Bernstein center of $G(k)$ for rational depths as a limit of depth-$r$ standard parahoric Hecke algebras, extending our previous work in the integral depths case (arXiv:2407.15128). Using this description, we construct maps from the space of stable functions on depth-$r$ Moy-Prasad quotients to the depth-$r$ center, and attach depth-$r$ Deligne-Lusztig parameters to smooth irreducible representations, with the assignment of parameters to irreducible representations shown to be consistent with restricted Langlands parameters for Moy-Prasad types described Chen-Debacker-Tsai (arXiv:2509.07780). As an application, we give a decomposition of the category of smooth representations into a product of full subcategories indexed by restricted depth-$r$ Langlands parameters.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There is consensus that sums $S_n={ {\Sigma }_{k=1}^n R_{0k} e^{i \theta_k}}$ of complex exponential terms, despite their mathematical significance, only possess closed-form representations for specific values of n and special values of their parameters and that there are no generally-accepted recursive formulae for their computation. This note is focused on recursive formulae that: (1) provide closed-form analytic representations of $S_n$ for any finite n; (2) include generalizations of the usual formula for the sum of two exponentials; and (3) are representable in the form $S_n= A_n exp({ i\Sigma_{k=1}^n \theta_k})$. The goal of the paper is to show that one may interpret the exponential term $exp(i \Sigma_{k=1}^n \theta_k)$ of $S_n$ as representing the projection, from a field of numbers that generalizes the complex numbers onto the complex plane, of a term representing quantities that are conserved under the addition and multiplication of numbers in the extended space. In particular, it is shown that the general form of a number in the extended field generalizes the form of a sum of complex exponentials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a subset $\mathcal{S}\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ and fixed $n,m\in \mathbb{N}$, one can study the distribution of the value of the smallest denominator $Q\in \mathcal{S}$, for which there exists $\mathbf{P}\in \mathbb{F}_q[x]^m$ such that $\frac{P}{Q}\in B(\boldsymbol{\alpha},q^{-n})$, where $Q\in \mathcal{S}$. On the other hand, one can study the discrete analogue, when $N\in \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ is a polynomial with $\deg(N)=n$ and $\boldsymbol{\alpha}\in \frac{1}{N}\mathbb{F}_q[x]^m$ as a discrete probability distribution function. We prove that for any infinite subset $\mathcal{S}\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q[x]$, for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$, and for any dimension $m$, the probability distribution functions of both these random variables are equal to one another. This is significantly stronger than the real setting, where Balazard and Martin proved that these functions have asymptotically close averages, when there are no restrictions on the denominators.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unlike the Hochschild chain complex of an algebra, the Hochschild cochain complex of an algebra is not functorial. Nonetheless, we show that the Hochschild cochain complex of an algebra even a dg category is of lax functoriality, i.e., there exists a lax functor from bicategory of dg categories to bicategory of $B_\infty$-algebras which sends every dg category to its Hochschild cochain complex. This result is a homotopy version of the lax functoriality of center of an algebra obtained by Davydov, Kong, Runkel, Grady, Oren, et al, in the more general context of dg categories, and extends the restricted functoriality of Hochschild cochain complex of a dg category obtained by Keller to global lax functoriality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent years, there has been extensive work on inequalities among partition functions. In particular, Nicolas, and independently DeSalvo--Pak, proved that the partition function $p(n)$ is eventually log-concave. Inspired by this and other results, Chern--Fu--Tang first conjectured log-concavity of $k$-coloured partitions. Three of the authors and Tripp later proved this conjecture by introducing recursive sequences and a strict inequality for fractional partition functions, giving explicit errors. In this paper, we show that the log-concavity is, in fact, strict for $k\geq 2$. We shed further light on this phenomenon by utilizing Hardy--Littlewood--P\'olya's notion of majorizing. We prove that for partitions $\bm{a},\bm{b}$ of $n\in\N$, if $\bm b$ majorizes $\bm a$, then $p_k(\bm{b})>p_k(\bm{a})$. Numerical calculations indicate that our result is sharp.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any ${\rm E}$-rigid presentation $e$, we construct an orthogonal projection functor to ${\rm rep}(e^\perp)$ left adjoint to the natural embedding. We establish a bijection between presentations in ${\rm rep}(e^\perp)$ and presentations compatible with $e$. For quivers with potentials, we show that ${\rm rep}(e^\perp)$ forms a module category of another quiver with potential. We derive mutation formulas for the $\delta$-vectors of positive and negative complements and the dimension vectors of simple modules in ${\rm rep}(e^\perp)$, enabling an algorithm to find the projected quiver with potential. Additionally, we introduce a modified projection for quivers with potentials that preserves general presentations. For applications to cluster algebras, we establish a connection to the stabilization functors.</p></details>

In so doing, we need to understand certain phantom oversized terms, which allow us to extract the right off-diagonal contributions.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study ancilla-free approximation of single-qubit unitaries $U\in {\rm SU}(2)$ by gate sequences over Clifford+$G$, where $G\in\{T,V\}$ or their generalization. Let $p$ denote the characteristic factor of the gate set (e.g., $p=2$ for $G=T$ and $p=5$ for $G=V$). We prove three asymptotic bounds on the minimum $G$-count required to achieve approximation error at most $\varepsilon$. First, for Haar-almost every $U$, we show that $3\log_{p}(1/\varepsilon)$ $G$-count is both necessary and sufficient; moreover, probabilistic synthesis improves the leading constant to $3/2$. Second, for unitaries whose ratio of matrix elements lies in a specified number field, $4\log_p(1/\varepsilon)$ $G$-count is necessary. Again, the leading constant can be improved to $2$ by probabilistic synthesis. Third, there exist unitaries for which the $G$-count per $\log_{p}(1/\varepsilon)$ fails to converge as $\varepsilon\to 0^+$. These results partially resolve a generalized form of the Ross--Selinger conjecture.</p></details>

Further, we show that for $b\geq 2$ there are infinitely many palindromes (with $n=\overleftarrow{n}$) that are cube-free. We also give asymptotic expressions for the counting functions corresponding to these results. The main tools we use are recent bounds from the literature on reversed primes and palindromes in arithmetic progressions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2013, Darryl McCullough and Marcus Wanderley made a series of conjectures that describe the Nielsen equivalence classes and $T_2$-equivalence classes of pairs of generators for $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and the Markoff equivalence classes of triples in $\mathbb{F}_q^3$ that solve $x^2+y^2+z^2=xyz+\kappa$ for some $\kappa\in\mathbb{F}_q$. (The case $\kappa=0$ was originally conjectured by Baragar in 1991.) We prove that one of the McCullough--Wanderley conjectures, the ``$Q$-classification conjecture" on Markoff triples, implies the others. Then we prove that the $Q$-classification conjecture holds if $q=p$ is a prime such that $27720$ does not divide $p^2-1$. More generally, for any integer $d$, we reduce the $Q$-classification conjecture for all primes $p\not\equiv \pm 1\,\text{mod}\,d$ to checking whether a roughly $2d\times 2d$ matrix with entries in $\mathbb{Q}[\kappa]$ is invertible. We (and SageMath) perform this invertibility check for $d=5$, 7, 8, 9, and 11, hence the modulus $27720=\text{lcm}(1,\dots,11)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** submitted to proceedings of 2026 ICM

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce and motivate -- based on ongoing joint work with Germ\'an Stefanich -- the notion of potent categorical representations of a complex reductive group $G$, specifically a conjectural Langlands correspondence identifying potent categorical representations of $G$ and its Langlands dual $\check G$. We emphasize the symplectic nature of potent categorical representations in their simultaneous dependence on parameters in maximal tori for $G$ and $\check G$, specifically how their conjectural Langlands correspondence fits within a 2-categorical Fourier transform. Our key tool to make various ideas precise is higher sheaf theory and its microlocalization, specifically a theory of ind-coherent sheaves of categories on stacks. The constructions are inspired by the physics of 3d mirror symmetry and S-duality on the one hand, and the theory of double affine Hecke algebras on the other. We also highlight further conjectures related to ongoing programs in and around geometric representation theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $C$ be a curve of genus $g \geq 2$, and let $J$ be its Jacobian. The choice of a degree 1 divisor $e$ on $C$ gives an embedding of $C$ into $J$; we denote by $[C]_{}^{e}\in \mathrm{CH}\left( J;\mathbb{Q} \right) $ the class in the Chow group of $J$ defined by the image of this embedding. It is known from the work of S.-W. Zhang that the vanishing of the Ceresa cycle $\mathrm{Cer}(C,e):=[C]^{e} - [-1]_* [C]^e$ is equivalent to both the vanishing of the 1st Beauville component $[C]_{(1)}^e$ and the vanishing of the 3rd Gross--Kudla--Schoen modified diagonal cycle $\Gamma^3(C,e) \in \mathrm{CH}(C^3;\mathbb{Q})$. In this paper, we extend this result to show that the vanishing of the $s$-th Beauville component $[C]^e_{(s)}$ for $s \geq 1$ is equivalent to the vanishing of the $(s+2)$-nd modified diagonal cycle $\Gamma^{s + 2}(C, e) \in \mathrm{CH}(C^{s+2};\mathbb{Q})$. We also establish "successive vanishing" results for these cycles: for instance, if $\Gamma^n(C, e) = \Gamma^{n + 1}(C, e)=0$, then $\Gamma^{k}(C, e) = 0$ for all $k \geq n$. In the $s=1$ case, we show an integral refinement to the original statement, relating the order of torsion of $\mathrm{Cer}(C,e) \in \mathrm{CH}(J;\mathbb{Z})$ to that of $\Gamma^3(C,e) \in \mathrm{CH}(C^3;\mathbb{Z})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the $K$-theoretic enumerative geometry of cyclic Nakajima quiver varieties, with particular focus on $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$, the equivariant Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$. The direct sum over $m$ of the equivariant $K$-theories of these varieties is known to be isomorphic to the ring symmetric functions in $l$ colors, with structure sheaves of torus fixed points identified with wreath Macdonald polynomials. Using properties of wreath Macdonald polynomials and the recent identification of the Maulik-Okounkov quantum affine algebra for cyclic quivers with the quantum toroidal algebras of type $A$, we derive an explicit formula for the generating function of capped vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$ with descendants given by exterior powers of the $0$th tautological bundle. We also sharpen the large framing vanishing results of Okounkov, providing a class of descendants and cyclic quiver varieties for which the capped vertex functions are purely classical. Our results also suggest certain integrality and wall-crossing conjectures for capped vertex functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study 2-Calabi-Yau tilted algebras which are non-commutative Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras of Gorenstein dimension 1. In particular, we are interested in their syzygy categories or equivalently the stable categories of Cohen-Macauley modules $\underline{\text{CMP}}$. First we show that if an algebra $A$ is Iwanaga-Gorenstein of Gorenstein dimension 1 then its stable category is generated under extensions by its radical $\text{rad}\,A$. Next, for a 2-Calabi-Yau tilted algebra $A$ we provide an explicit relationship between the $\underline{\text{CMP}}$ category of $A$ and its quotient $A/Ae_iA$ by an ideal generated by an idempotent $e_i$. Consequently, we obtain various equivalent characterizations of when the $\underline{\text{CMP}}$ category remains the same after passing to the quotient. We also obtain applications to two classes of algebras that are CM finite, the dimer tree algebras and their skew group algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a multidimensional generalization of Zeckendorf's Theorem (any positive integer can be written uniquely as a sum of non-adjacent Fibonacci numbers) to a large family of linear recurrences. This extends work of Anderson and Bicknell-Johnson in the multi-dimensional case when the underlying recurrence is the same as the Fibonacci one. Our extension applies to linear recurrence relations defined by vectors $\vec{\mathbf{c}} = (c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k)$ such that $c_1\geq c_2\geq\cdots \geq c_k$ and where $c_k = 1$. Under these conditions, we prove that every integer vector in $\mathbb{Z}^{k-1}$ admits a unique $\vec{\mathbf{c}}$-satisfying representation ($\vec{\mathbf{c}}$-SR) as a linear combination of vectors, $(\vec{\mathbf{X}}_n)_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}$ defined for every $n\in \mathbb{Z}$ by initially by zero and standard unit vectors and then the recursion $$\vec{\mathbf{X}}_{n} := c_1\vec{\mathbf{X}}_{n -1} + c_2\vec{\mathbf{X}}_{n - 2} + \cdots + c_k\vec{\mathbf{X}}_{n-k}.$$ To establish this, we introduce carrying and borrowing operations that use the defining recursion to transform any $\vec{\mathbf{c}}$ representation into a $\vec{\mathbf{c}}$-SR while preserving the underlying vector. Then, by establishing bijections with properties of scalar Positive Linear Recurrence Sequences (PLRS), we prove that these multidimensional decompositions inherit various properties, such as the number of summands exhibits Gaussian behavior and summand minimality of $\vec{\mathbf{c}}$-SRs over all all $\vec{\mathbf{c}}$-representations.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Corrects minor errors related to Schur's recurrence relations

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1975, G. E. Andrews challenged the mathematics community to address L. Ehrenpreis' problem, which was to directly prove the modularity of the Rogers-Ramanujan $q$-series' summatory forms. This question is important because many different $q$-series appearing in combinatorics, representation theory, and physics often seem to be "mysteriously" modular, yet there is no general test to confirm this directly from the exotic $q$-series expressions. In this note, we solve this general problem using $q$-series algebra and $q$-series systems of differential equations. Specifically, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which a vector of holomorphic $q$-series on $|q|<1$ forms a vector-valued modular function. This result offers a clear and conceptual path to modularity for "strange" $q$-series.</p></details>

For real part greater than 1, we characterise a boundary beyond which WAM is holomorphic and bounded. In this region, we show that WAM is related to the multiplicity of the largest prime factor of the triple, a quantity that we connect with the original ABC conjecture and whose distribution we explore computationally.</p></details>

We prove this correspondence in the cases associated to the group $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, and Riemann surfaces of genus zero with a number of punctures larger than three. A crucial ingredient is a unitary integral transformation mapping products of solutions to the ordinary differential equation associated to a real oper to eigenfunctions of the quantised Hitchin Hamiltonians. This allows us to construct joint eigenfunctions of Hecke operators and Hitchin Hamiltonians from real opers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The object of this article is to study some aspects of the quantum geometric Langlands program in the language of vertex algebras. We investigate the representation theory of the vertex algebra of chiral differential operators on a reductive group $\mathcal{D}_{G}^{\kappa}$ for generic levels. For instance we show that the geometric Satake equivalence degenerates. Then, we study the representation theory of the equivariant affine $\mathcal{W}$-algebra $\mathcal{W}_{G}^{\kappa}$, defined by Arakawa as the principal quantum Hamiltonian reduction of $\mathcal{D}_{G}^{\kappa}$. We construct a family of simple modules for $\mathcal{W}_{G}^{\kappa}$ whose combinatorics matches that of the representation theory of the Langlands dual group. To put this construction in perspective we propose a vertex-algebraic formulation of the fundamental local equivalence of Gaitsgory and Lurie. Finally, we give a proof when the group is an algebraic torus or is simple adjoint of classical simply laced type.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Peter Scholze has raised the question whether some variant of the $q$-de Rham complex is already defined over the Habiro ring $\mathcal H = \lim_{m\in\mathbb N}\mathbb Z[q]_{(q^m-1)}^\wedge$. We show that such a variant exists whenever the $q$-de Rham complex can be equipped with a "$q$-Hodge filtration": a $q$-deformation of the Hodge filtration, subject to some reasonable conditions. To any such $q$-Hodge filtration we associate a small modification of the $q$-de Rham complex, which we call the $q$-Hodge complex, and show that it descends canonically to the Habiro ring. This construction recovers and generalises the Habiro ring of a number field of Garoufalidis-Scholze-Wheeler-Zagier and is closely related to the $q$-de Rham--Witt complexes from previous work of the author as well as, conjecturally, to Scholze's analytic Habiro stack. While there's no canonical $q$-Hodge filtration in general, we show that it does exist in many cases of interest. For example, for a smooth scheme $X$ over $\mathbb Z$, the $q$-de Rham complex can be equipped with a canonical $q$-Hodge filtration as soon as one inverts all primes $p\leq \dim(X/\mathbb Z)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to better understand a family of linear degenerations of the classical Lagrangian Grassmannians $\Lambda(2n)$. It is the special case for $k=n$ of the varieties $X(k,2n)^{sp}$, introduced in previous joint work with Evgeny Feigin, Martina Lanini and Alexander P\"utz. These varieties are obtained as isotropic subvarieties of a family of quiver Grassmannians $X(n,2n)$, and are acted on by a linear degeneration of the algebraic group $Sp_{2n}$. We prove a conjecture proposed in the paper above for this particular case, which states that the ordering on the set of orbits in $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ given by closure-inclusion coincides with a combinatorially defined order on what are called symplectic $(n,2n)$-juggling patterns, much in the same way that the $Sp_{2n}$ orbits in $\Lambda(2n)$ are parametrized by a type C Weyl group with the Bruhat order. The dimension of such orbits is computed via the combinatorics of bounded affine permutations, and it coincides with the length of some permutation in a Coxeter group of affine type C. Furthermore, the varieties $X(n,2n)$ are GKM, that is, they have trivial cohomology in odd degree and are equipped with the action of an algebraic torus with finitely many fixed points and 1-dimensional orbits. In this paper it is proven that $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ is also GKM, with respect to the action of a subtorus of the above torus.</p></details>

Multiplicativity of the perverse filtration and the "Perverse $\supset$ Chern" phenomenon for these abelian fibrations are immediate consequences of our theory. We also show that our class of fibrations include families of compactified Jacobians of integral locally planar curves. Applications include the following: (a) we prove the motivic decomposition conjecture for this class (including compactified Jacobian fibrations), which generalizes Deninger-Murre's theorem for abelian schemes; (b) we provide a new proof of the P=W conjecture for $\mathrm{GL}_r$; (c) we prove half of the P=C conjecture concerning refined BPS invariants for the local $\mathbb{P}^2$; (d) we show that the perverse filtration for the compactified Jacobian associated with an integral locally planar curve is multiplicative, which generalizes a result of Oblomkov-Yun for homogeneous singularities. Our techniques combine Arinkin's autoduality for coherent categories, Ng\^o's support theorem for the decomposition theorem, Adams operations in operational K-theory, and Corti-Hanamura's theory of relative Chow motives.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The notion of $n$-exangulated categories was introduced by Herschend-Liu-Nakaoka, which is a simultaneous generalization of $n$-exact categories in the sense of Jasso and $(n+2)$-angulated categories in the sense of Geiss-Kelier-Oppermann. Let $(\mathscr{C},\mathbb{E},\mathfrak{s})$ be an $n$-exangulated category with enough projectives $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ a full subcategory of $\mathscr{C}$ containing $\mathcal{P}$. In the present paper, It is proved that a certian quotient category of $\mathfrak{s}$-def$(\mathcal{M})$ is abelian. We denoted by $S(\mathscr{C})$ the category of $n$-exangles, whose object are given by distinguished $n$-exangles in $\mathscr{C}$. If $\mathcal{M}=\mathscr{C}$, we obtain that a certain ideal quotient category $S(\mathscr{C})/\mathcal{R}_2$ is equivalent to the category of finitely presented modules mod-$(\mathscr{C}/[\mathcal{P}])$. Furthermore, we present the quotient category $S(\mathscr{C})/\mathcal{R}_2$ always has an abelian structure when taking $n$ as an even number. The abelian quotient $S(\mathscr{C})/\mathcal{R}_2$ admits some nice properties. We describe the projective objects in $S(\mathscr{C})/\mathcal{R}_2$ and characterize the simple objects in $S(\mathscr{C})/\mathcal{R}_2$ as Auslander-Reiten $n$-exangle sequences in $\mathscr{C}$.</p></details>

These elements are closely related to the study of associated varieties of highest weight modules of $\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{C})$. Firstly, we give a complete classification of the KL right cells containing only smooth elements. Then we give a sufficient condition for a KL right cell to contain only non-smooth elements by using invariant subsequences and a sufficient condition for a KL right cell to contain some smooth elements. Finally, we give an efficient algorithm to find out all the smooth elements in a given KL right cell.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Hodge filtrations of Schmid and Vilonen on unipotent representations of real reductive groups. We show that for various well-defined classes of unipotent representations (including, for example, the oscillator representations of metaplectic groups, the minimal representations of all simple groups, and all unipotent representations of complex groups) the Hodge filtration coincides with the quantization filtration predicted by the Orbit Method. We deduce a number of longstanding conjectures about such representations, including a proof that they are unitary and a description of their $K$-types in terms of co-adjoint orbits. The proofs rely heavily on certain good homological properties of the Hodge filtrations on weakly unipotent representations, which are established using a Hodge-theoretic upgrade of the Beilinson-Bernstein theory of intertwining functors for $\mathcal{D}$-modules on the flag variety. The latter consists of an action of the affine Hecke algebra on a category of filtered monodromic $\mathcal{D}$-modules, which we use to compare Hodge filtrations coming from different localizations of the same representation. As an application of the same methods, we also prove a new cohomology vanishing theorem for mixed Hodge modules on partial flag varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper continuous extensions of Dirichlet series of a particular form are established. The approach is based on the fact that these Dirichlet series and their derivatives are given by linear functionals on certain inner product spaces of meromorphic functions, the proof of which depends on the observation that if limits of derivatives do not exist then certain four dimensional subspaces are symplectic, which imposes sufficient rigidity to reach a contradiction. As an example application of Delange's Tauberian theorem, it is shown that the conjectured asymptotic in the additive divisor problem follows conditionally on the non-vanishing of a particular meromorphic function and its derivatives on the imaginary axis.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a calculus based on graph enumeration for $S_n$-equivariant motivic invariants of graphically stratified moduli spaces. We apply our theory to the Deligne--Mumford moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}$ and to the space of torus-fixed stable maps $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}(X, \beta)^{\mathbb{C}^\star}$ when the target $X$ admits an appropriate $\mathbb{C}^\star$-action, deriving new formulas in each case. A key role is played by the P\'olya--Petersen character of a graph, which enriches P\'olya's classical cycle index polynomial. This character is valued in an algebra $\Lambda^{[2]}$ of wreath product symmetric functions, which we study from combinatorial and representation-theoretic perspectives. We prove that this algebra may be viewed as the Grothendieck ring of the category of polynomial functors which take symmetric sequences of vector spaces to vector spaces, building on foundational work of Macdonald. This leads to a plethystic action of $\Lambda^{[2]}$ on the ring $\Lambda$ of ordinary symmetric functions. Using this action, we derive our formulas, which ultimately involve only ordinary symmetric functions and the Grothendieck ring of mixed Hodge structures.</p></details>

More generally, for a linear recurrence sequence $u_n$ satisfying the dominant root condition and a given set of primes $p_1, \ldots, p_k$, there exist only finitely many pairs $(u_m, u_n)$ satisfying $u_m^b/u_n^a=p_1^{g_1} \cdots p_k^{g_k}$ for some integers $g_1, \ldots, g_k$, $a$, and $b$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The local simple $9$-fold flop of Grassmannian type is a birational transformation between total spaces of vector bundles on the Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(2, 5)$ and $\mathrm{Gr}(3, 5)$. We produce four different derived equivalences which commute with the pushforward functors for the flopping contractions. These equivalences are realized by identifying four different window categories inside the derived category of coherent sheaves on an Artin stack. As an application, our approach provides a new proof of derived equivalence for a pair of non-birational Calabi-Yau threefolds realized as zero loci of sections of homogeneous vector bundles in Grassmannians.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We apply poset cocalculus, a functor calculus framework for functors out of a poset, to study the problem of decomposing multipersistence modules into simpler components. We both prove new results in this topic and offer a new perspective on already established results. In particular, we show that a pointwise finite-dimensional bipersistence module is middle-exact if and only if it is isomorphic to the homology of a homotopy degree 1 functor, from which we deduce a novel, more synthetic proof of the interval decomposability of middle-exact bipersistence modules. We also give a new decomposition theorem for middle-exact multipersistence modules indexed over a finite poset, stating that such a module can always be written as a direct sum of a projective module, an injective module, and a bidegree 1 module, even in the case where it is not pointwise finite-dimensional.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove distributional results for mixed character sums \begin{equation*} \sum_{n\le x }\chi(n)e(n\theta), \end{equation*} for fixed $\theta\in [0,1]$ and random character $\chi \pmod q$, as well as for a fixed character $\chi$ and randomly sampled $\theta\in [0,1].$ We present various applications of our results. For example, we construct Littlewood polynomials with large Mahler measure, thus establishing a new record in the Mahler problem (1963). We also show that $L_{2k}$ norms of well-known Turyn polynomials are asymptotically minimized at the shift $\alpha=1/4,$ proving a conjecture of G\"unther and Schmidt. An important ingredient in our work is a general way of dealing with "log-integrability" problems.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the generating series associated with the degree sequence of a monomial self-map of a projective toric variety. We establish conditions under which this series has its circle of convergence as a natural boundary, and hence is a transcendental, non-holonomic function. In the case of toric surfaces, our results are sharp; moreover, we answer a question of Bell by proving that their reductions modulo $p$ are transcendental for all but finitely many prime numbers $p$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** We thank Professor Dr. Shparlinski for kindly pointing out our misuse of the bounds for sums of Kloosterman sums (in Sections 4 and 5). This has been corrected in the revised version v2

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a construction of radial Fourier interpolation formulas in dimensions 3 and 4 using Maass--Poincar\'e type series. As a corollary we obtain explicit formulas for the basis functions of these interpolation formulas in terms of what we call real-variable Kloosterman sums, which were previously introduced by Stoller. We also improve the bounds on the corresponding basis functions $a_{n,d}(x)$, $d=3,4$, for fixed $x$, in terms of the index $n$.</p></details>
