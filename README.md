### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04081v1'>2512.04081</a>\]&nbsp; **Additive relations in irrational powers**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-03 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Joseph Harrison &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the additive theory of the set $S = \{1^c, 2^c, \dots, N^c\}$ when $c$ is a real number. In the language of additive combinatorics, we determine the asymptotic behaviour of the additive energy of $S$. When $c$ is rational, this is either known, or follows from existing results, and our contribution is a resolution of the irrational case. We deduce that for all $c \not \in \{0, 1, 2\}$, the cardinality of the sumset $S + S$ asymptotically attains its natural upper bound $N(N + 1)/2$, as $N \to \infty$. We show that there are infinitely many, effectively computable numbers $c$ such that the set $\{p^c : \textrm{$p$ prime}\}$ is additively dissociated (actually linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$), and we provide an effective procedure to compute the digits of such $c$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-03 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ryan Alweiss &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DS &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages, 1 figure, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that there is a set which is not a set of multiple recurrence despite being a set of recurrence for nil-Bohr sets. This answers Huang, Shao, and Ye's \enquote{higher-order} version of Katznelson's Question on Bohr recurrence and topological recurrence in the negative. Equivalently, we construct a set $S$ so that there is a finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ without three-term arithmetic progressions with common differences in $S$, but so that $S$ lacks the usual polynomial obstacles to arithmetic progressions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The $k$-Markov numbers, introduced by Gyoda and Matsushita, are those which appear in positive integral solutions to $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k(xy + xz + yz) = (3+3k)xyz$. When $k =0$, this recovers the ordinary Markov numbers. A long-standing question in the theory of Markov numbers is Frobenius's unicity conjecture, concerning whether every Markov number is the maximum in a unique solution triple. Aigner gave a series of weaker, related conjectures which were confirmed to be true by Lee, Li, Rabideau, and Schiffler using techniques from the theory of cluster algebras. We show here that $k$-Markov numbers also satisfy Aigner's conjectures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a novel type of connection between random walks and analytic number theory. Working with a random walk on the circle group $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ in which each step is a random integer multiple of a given quadratic irrational $α$, we show that the rate of convergence to uniformity in the quadratic Wasserstein metric (also known as the periodic $L^2$ discrepancy) is governed by deep arithmetic invariants of the ring of algebraic integers of the real quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(α)$, such as fundamental units and special values of zeta functions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-03 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yvann Gaudillot-Estrada &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the representation theory of various convolution algebras attached to the $q$-deformation of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ from an algebraic perspective and beyond the unitary case. We show that many aspects of the classical representation theory of real semisimple groups can be transposed to this context. In particular, we prove an analogue of the Harish-Chandra isomorphism and we introduce an analogue of parabolic induction. We use these tools to classify the non-unitary irreducible representations of $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. Moreover, we explicitly show how they converge to the classical admissible dual of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. For that purpose, we define a version of the quantized universal enveloping algebra defined over the ring of analytic functions on $\mathbb{R}_+^*$, which specializes at $q = 1$ to the enveloping $\ast$-algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 40 pages, 7 figures, corrected a remark and changed the title to better reflect the result proven in the article, fixed some typos

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We count and give a parametrization of connected components in the space of flags transverse to a given transverse pair in every flag varieties of $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$. We compute the effect the involution of the unipotent radical has on those components and, using methods of Dey--Greenberg--Riestenberg, we show that for certain parabolic subgroups $P_Θ$, any $P_Θ$-Anosov subgroup is virtually isomorphic to either a surface group of a free group. We give examples of Anosov subgroups which are neither free nor surface groups for some sets of roots which do not fall under the previous results. As a consequence of the methods developed here, we get an explicit computation of some Plücker coordinates to check if a unipotent matrix in $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$ belong to the $Θ$-positive semigroup $U_Θ^{>0}$ when $p\neq q$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Disproving a conjecture of Bleicher and Erdős, we show that there exists a lacunary sequence of positive integers such that finite sums of reciprocals of its terms attain all rational numbers from a non-empty open interval. We also study several stronger variants of their original problem: determining the value of the optimal lacunarity parameter, representing rational numbers infinitely many times, finding such lacunary sequences with arbitrarily large jumps, and relating the maximal length of a filled interval to a prescribed lacunarity parameter.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-03 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Norihiro Hanihara, Junyang Liu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 18 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct left and right Calabi-Yau structures on derived respectively singularity categories of symmetric orders $Λ$ over commutative Gorenstein rings $R$. For this, we first construct Calabi-Yau structures over $R$ by lifting Amiot's construction of Calabi-Yau structures on Verdier quotients to the dg level. Then we prove base change properties relating Calabi-Yau structures over $R$ to those over the base field $k$. As a result, we prove the existence of a right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category associated with $Λ$ which is a cyclic lift of the weak Calabi-Yau structure constructed by the first-named author and Iyama. We also show the existence of a left Calabi-Yau structure on the dg bounded derived category of $Λ$. This is a non-commutative generalization of a result by Brav and Dyckerhoff. By combining the existence of the right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category with a structure theorem by Keller and the second-named author, we deduce that under suitable hypotheses, the singularity category associated with $Λ$ is triangle equivalent to a generalized cluster category in the sense of Amiot.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we combine the concepts of the fibered Burnside ring and the character ring, viewing them as fibered biset functors, into what we call the global representation fibered ring of a finite group. We compute all ring homomorphisms from this ring to the complex numbers, determine its spectrum and its connected components, and identify the primitive idempotents of this ring tensor with $\mathbb{Q}$ and its conductors.</p></details>

> **Comment:** In the new version, we add a new result (Theorem 8.1): the $\mathbb{Z}[v,v^{-1}]$-algebra $\mathcal{D}\mathcal{K}^{ss,*,\mathrm{red}}$ constructed by semisimple complexes and the restriction functor in section 6, is isomorphic to the extension counting integral form of the generic Bridgeland's Hall algebra and is isomorphic to the Poisson integral form of the quantum group

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As one of results in [6], Bridgeland realized the quantum group $\mathbf{U}_v$ via the localization of Ringel-Hall algebra for the two-periodic projective complexes of quiver representations over a finite field. In the present paper, we generalize Lusztig's categorical construction for the nilpotent part $\mathbf{U}_v^+$ to Bridgeland's Hall algebra of Dynkin type. In particular, we obtain a basis of the Ringel-Hall algebra for the two-periodic projective complexes which has the positivity, and we categorify an integral form of the generic Bridgeland's Hall algebra which is isomorphic to the Poisson integral form of $\mathbf{U}_v$, and obtain a $\mathbb{Z}[v,v^{-1}]$-basis of this integral form.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Clarification added to Prop 4.2 10 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Erdős and Graham (Erdős and Graham, 1980) asked if there exists an $n$ such that the divisors of $n$ greater than 1 are the moduli of a distinct covering system with the following property: If there exists an integer which satisfies two congruences in the system, $a\mod d$ and $a'\mod d'$, then $\gcd(d,d')=1$. We show that such an $n$ does not exist. This problem is part of Problem # 204 on the website www.erdosproblems.com, compiled and maintained by Thomas Bloom. We also study when the divisors of $n$ greater than $1$ can form a congruence system satisfying the above condition.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 9 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Chang--Haiden--Schroll shows that the braid group action on full exceptional collections in a triangulated category is not transitive but has infinitely many orbits in general. Their proof is based on a geometric model and the theory of branched coverings such as Birman--Hilden theory. This paper provides a simple algebraic proof of their theorem.</p></details>

We call this set the magnetic equivariant graded Brauer group and its structure as an abelian group is explicitly determined. Following Karoubi, we argue that the elements of this graded Brauer group parametrize the twistings of the magnetic equivariant K-theory of a point.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>If $a$ and $b$ are integers with $b>a>1$, we completely characterize ``long'' arithmetic progressions in the sumsets of the geometric progressions $1, a, a^2, a^3, \ldots$ and $1, b, b^2, b^3, \ldots$. Our proofs utilize recent applications of bounds for linear forms in logarithms to $S$-unit equations, and consequences of the modularity of Frey-Hellegouarch curves, together with elementary arguments.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an upper bound for the number of rational points of bounded height on irreducible affine hypersurfaces. More precisely, given an irreducible polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[X_1, \dots, X_n]$, we prove an upper bound on the number of points $(x_1, \dots, x_n) \in \mathbb{Q}^n$ such that $f(x_1, \dots, x_n) = 0$ and each component has height at most $B$. To prove this, we require a quantitative form of Hilbert's irreducibility theorem, where we bound the number of reducible specialisations of an irreducible polynomial at rational points of bounded height.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 24 pages. Comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, assuming the weak Schanuel Conjecture (WSC), we prove that for any collection of pairwise non-arithmetically equivalent totally real number fields, the residues at $s=1$ of their Dedekind zeta functions form a linearly independent set over the field of algebraic numbers. As a corollary, we obtain that, under WSC, two totally real number fields have the same regulator if and only if they have the same class number and Dedekind zeta function. We also prove that, under WSC, the isometry and similarity classes of the log unit lattice of a real Galois number field of degree $[K:\Q]\geq 4$, characterize the isomorphism class of said field. All of our results follow from establishing that, under WSC, any Gram matrix of the log unit lattice of a real Galois number field yields a generic point of certain closed irreducible $\Q$-subvariety of the space of symmetric matrices of appropriate size.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 27 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a framework for describing vector bundles on $μ_n$-gerbes over curves and illustrate the construction through two detailed examples. Using the interpretation of Brauer classes as obstructions to descending determinantal line bundles from the algebraic closure, together with a geometric analysis of the moduli space of twisted sheaves, we prove that for genus $2$ curves there exist Brauer classes over the base field whose period equals their index. Over $C_1$-fields, we further show that every $2$-torsion class in the Brauer group of a genus $2$ curve satisfies the period-index problem. As an application, we construct higher-dimensional varieties obtained as fibre products of genus $2$ curves over $C_1$-fields whose $2$-torsion algebraic Brauer classes also satisfy the period-index problem, providing new evidence toward the period-index conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Tom Leinster gave a bijective correspondence between the set of operators on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ and the set of pairs consisting of a nilpotent operator and a vector in $V$. Over a finite field this bijection implies that the probability that an operator be nilpotent is the reciprocal of the number of vectors in $V$. We generalize this correspondence to pairs of operators between pairs of vector spaces and determine the probability that a random pair of operators be nilpotent. We also determine the set-theoretical counterpart of this construction and compute the number of eventually constant pairs of maps between two finite sets, closely related to the number of spanning trees in a complete bipartite graph.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cohomology theories with values in LCA (locally compact abelian) groups suffer from the problem that the latter do not form an abelian category. However, the category LCA has a canonical abelian category envelope, the heart of a suitable t-structure. It adds formal cokernel objects. We show the surprising result that these abstract cokernels can also be interpreted as Hausdorff topological abelian groups, at least up to lattice isogenies. These need not be locally compact.</p></details>

When $S$ contains all primes above $p$ (the ``wild'' setting), it is a consequence of global Poitou-Tate duality that $\Sha^1_S(K,A')^\vee \simeq \Sha^2_S(K,A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\hookrightarrow} \RusB_S(K,A) $ is non-increasing as $S$ increases. The same applies when $G_{K,S}$ is replaced by its maximal pro-$p$ quotient $G_{K,S}(p)$. In [4] it was shown that for $S$ tame and $A=\mathbb{F}_p$ with trivial action, the group $\Sha^2_S(K, A)$ can increase as $S$ increases to $S\cup X$, and even attain its maximal dimension, $\dim_{\mathbb{F}_p} \RusB_S(K,\mathbb{F}_p)$, for carefully chosen $X$. We strengthen this to general $\mathbb{F}_p[G_{K,S}]$-modules $A$ where $S$ is tame. We use Liu's definition [7] of $\RusB_S(K,A)$ to show that $\Sha^2_S(K,A) \hookrightarrow \RusB_S(K,A)$ and that there exist infinitely many tame sets of primes $X$ of $K$ such that $\Sha^2_{S\cup X}(K,A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\hookrightarrow} \RusB_{S \cup X}(K,A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\twoheadleftarrow} \RusB_S(K,A) \hookleftarrow \Sha^2_S(K,A)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a Fourier--analytic framework for establishing spectral reciprocity formulas linking $\mathrm{GL}_3$ and $\mathrm{GL}_2$ automorphic spectra over number fields. The method applies uniformly to cuspidal and non-cuspidal $\mathrm{GL}_3$ representations and treats Motohashi-type and Blomer--Khan-type reciprocities in a parallel manner, revealing intrinsic connections between them and extending each to new settings. We also obtain explicit weight transforms in the analytic newvector and spherical cases. Applications include first-moment estimates for $\mathrm{GL}_3\times\mathrm{GL}_2$ $L$-functions over number fields, an explicit twisted fourth moment for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ $L$-functions over totally real fields, a sharp upper bound for the fifth moment, subconvexity for triple product $L$-functions, and new simultaneous nonvanishing results.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We say that an abelian variety is degenerate if its Hodge ring is not generated by divisor classes. Degeneracy leads to some interesting challenges when computing Sato-Tate groups, and there are currently few examples and techniques presented in the literature. In this paper we focus on the Jacobians of the family of curves $C_{p^2}: y^2=x^{p^2}-1$, where $p$ is an odd prime. Using a construction developed by Shioda in the 1980s, we are able to characterize so-called indecomposable Hodge classes as well as the Sato-Tate groups of these Jacobian varieties. Our work is inspired by computation, and examples and methods are described throughout the paper.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Bateman--Horn Conjecture predicts how often an irreducible polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ assumes prime values. We demonstrate that with sufficient averaging in the coefficients of $f$ (viz. exponential in the size of the inputs), one can not only prove Bateman--Horn results on average but also pin down precise information about the distribution of prime values. We show that 100\% of polynomials (in an $L^k$ sense for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$) satisfy the Bateman--Horn Conjecture, and that that 100\% of polynomials (in an $L^2$ sense) satisfy an appropriate polynomial analogue of the Hardy--Littlewood Prime Tuples Conjecture. We use the latter to prove that 100\% of polynomials satisfy the appropriate analogue of the Poisson Tail Conjecture, in the sense that the distribution of the gaps between consecutive prime values around the average spacing is Poisson. We also study the frequencies of sign patterns of the Liouville function evaluated at the consecutive outputs of $f$; viewing $f$ as a random variable, we establish the limiting distribution for every sign pattern. The Chowla problem along random polynomials is a special case. A key input behind all of our arguments is Leng's recent quantitative work on the higher-order Fourier uniformity of the von Mangoldt and Möbius functions (in turn relying on Leng, Sah, and Sawhney's quantitative inverse theorem for the Gowers norms).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The distribution of prime constellations, such as Twin Primes ($p, p+2$), is traditionally analyzed via probabilistic models or analytic sieve theory. While heuristic predictions are accurate, rigorous proofs are obstructed by the "Parity Barrier", which prevents classical sieves from distinguishing primes from semi-primes in the asymptotic limit. In this work, we present a structural proof of existence based on deterministic signal processing. We treat the sequence of integers as a signal generated by a rigid Diophantine basis ($N=2n+3m$) and define a fundamental certification window $\mathcal{W} = [P, m_0^2)$ derived from the basis limit $m_0$. We demonstrate that the non-existence of constellations (the "Null Hypothesis") constitutes a low-entropy signal state, a "Prime Desert", that requires infinite spectral resolution to maintain over a quadratic window. Since the sieving basis is finite ($p \le m_0$), the system is band-limited and structurally incapable of synthesizing the destructive interference required to sustain a zero count. By invoking the Chinese Remainder Theorem and analyzing the detailed correlation structure of residue classes, we prove that positive and negative correlations between sieved positions cancel at leading order, constraining the variance of the signal to scale linearly with the mean ($O(μ)$) rather than the quadratic scaling ($Ω(μ^2)$) required to support a Prime Desert. This Variance Gap implies that the signal must strictly oscillate around its mean, rendering the existence of prime constellations a mandatory consequence of the system's finite spectral bandwidth.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Symplectic slice theorems elucidate the local structure of symplectic manifolds carrying Hamiltonian actions of compact Lie groups. We generalize these theorems in two natural settings. The first is based on the idea that complex reductive algebraic groups are the natural complex-geometric counterparts of compact Lie groups. Using new definitions of Poisson and symplectic slices, we prove analogues of the classical symplectic slice theorems for Hamiltonian actions of complex reductive algebraic groups. These analogues have versions in the complex-algebraic and holomorphic categories, and make extensive use of Slodowy slices and decomposition classes in complex reductive Lie algebras. The starting point for our second setting is the fact that Hamiltonian Lie group actions are special cases of Hamiltonian symplectic groupoid actions. We generalize the classical symplectic slice theorems to the latter case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $q=p^f$ be a prime power and let $H$ be a classical group of type $A$, so $H \cong \mathrm{SL}_d(q)$ or $\mathrm{GL}_d(q)$, acting on its natural module $V$ of dimension $d$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Let $W$ be an absolutely irreducible $\mathbb{F}_qH$--module such that, over an algebraic closure, $W$ is isomorphic (up to Frobenius twists) to a tensor product $\bigotimes_{t=1}^r L(λ^{(t)})$, where each $L(λ^{(t)})$ is an irreducible polynomial representation of $\mathrm{GL}_d$ of degree $k_t$, and the total degree $K=\sum_t k_t$ satisfies $K<q-1$. We prove a base-$q$ injectivity lemma which shows that, for a Singer cycle $s \in H$, the eigenvalues of $s$ on $W \otimes_{\mathbb{F}_q} \mathbb{F}_{q^d}$ are parametrised by digit vectors of length $d$ with entries bounded by $K$. In particular, distinct weights of $W$ correspond to distinct eigenvalues. If in addition $W$ is multiplicity-free for the diagonal torus of $\mathrm{GL}_d$, then every eigenspace of $s$ is one-dimensional, so $s$ has a simple spectrum on $W$. Using this spectral property we design a Las Vegas rewriting algorithm which, given $G \leq \mathrm{GL}(W)$ isomorphic to $H$ and acting irreducibly on $W$, constructs a projective representation of $G$ of degree $d$ equivalent to the natural representation of $H$. The expected running time is polynomial in $d$, $\log q$ and $K$, and in the cost of field operations and discrete logarithm computations in $\mathbb{F}_{q^d}$. This extends earlier rewriting algorithms of Magaard--O'Brien--Seress and of Gül--Ankaralıoğlu to a broader class of twisted tensor products of polynomial modules.</p></details>

Kane et al.\ recently verified this conjecture using analytic methods. We offer an alternative proof using the theory of $\ell$-adic Galois representations associated to modular forms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the question of determining whether two binary cubic forms over an arbitrary field $K$ whose characteristic is not $2$ or $3$ are equivalent under the actions of either GL$(2,K)$ or SL$(2,K)$, deriving two necessary and sufficient criteria for such equivalence in each case. One of these involves an algebraic invariant of binary cubic forms which we call the Cardano invariant, which is closely connected to classical formulas and also appears in the work of Bhargava et al. The second criterion is expressed in terms of the base field itself, and also gives explicit matrices in SL$(2,K)$ or GL$(2,K)$ transforming one cubic into the other, if any exist, in terms of the coefficients of bilinear factors of a bicovariant of the two cubics. We also consider automorphisms of a single binary cubic form, show how to use our results to test equivalence of binary cubic forms over an integral domain such as~$\mathbb{Z}$, and briefly recall some connections between binary cubic forms and the arithmetic of elliptic curves. The methods used are elementary, and similar to those used in our earlier work with Fisher concerning equivalences between binary quartic forms.</p></details>

For example, given positive integers $a,b$ satisfying some algebraic conditions and a positive integer $C\ge3$, we will show that for any sufficiently large integer $n$ with $\ord_2(n)\le C$, there exist non-negative integers $x,y,z,w$ such that $$ \begin{cases} x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2=n, ax+by\in\mathcal{S}, \end{cases} $$ where $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of all squares over $\mathbb{Z}$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a simple $q$-ary family of single-error-correcting, double-error-detecting (SEC--DED) linear codes whose parity checks are tied directly to the base-$p$ ($q=p$ prime) digits of the coordinate index. For blocklength $n=p^r$ the construction uses only $r+1$ parity checks -- \emph{near-Hamming} overhead -- and admits an index-based decoder that runs in a single pass with constant-time location and magnitude recovery from the syndromes. Based on the prototype, we develop two extensions: Code A1, which removes specific redundant trits to achieve higher information rate and support variable-length encoding; and Code A2, which incorporates two group-sum checks together with a 3-wise XOR linear independence condition on index subsets, yielding a ternary distance-4 (SEC--TED) variant. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the framework generalizes via $n$-wise XOR linearly independent sets to construct codes with distance $d = n + 1$, notably recovering the ternary Golay code for $n = 5$ -- showing both structural generality and a serendipitous link to optimal classical codes. Our contribution is not optimality but \emph{implementational simplicity} and an \emph{array-friendly} structure: the checks are digitwise and global sums, the mapping from syndromes to error location is explicit, and the SEC--TED upgrade is modular. We position the scheme against classical $q$-ary Hamming and SPC/product-code baselines and provide a small comparison of parity overhead, decoding work, and two-error behavior.</p></details>

Using the criteria, we conclude that (ASA) can be completely controlled by the Dirichlet density of the places and the splitting field of $G$, which generalizes a result of Rapinchuk and Tralle.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Many natural computational problems in computer science, mathematics, physics, and other sciences amount to deciding if two objects are equivalent. Often this equivalence is defined in terms of group actions. A natural question is to ask when two objects can be distinguished by polynomial functions that are invariant under the group action. For finite groups, this is the usual notion of equivalence, but for continuous groups like the general linear groups it gives rise to a new notion, called orbit closure intersection. It captures, among others, the graph isomorphism problem, noncommutative PIT, null cone problems in invariant theory, equivalence problems for tensor networks, and the classification of multiparty quantum states. Despite recent algorithmic progress in celebrated special cases, the computational complexity of general orbit closure intersection problems is currently quite unclear. In particular, tensors seem to give rise to the most difficult problems. In this work we start a systematic study of orbit closure intersection from the complexity-theoretic viewpoint. To this end, we define a complexity class TOCI that captures the power of orbit closure intersection problems for general tensor actions, give an appropriate notion of algebraic reductions that imply polynomial-time reductions in the usual sense, but are amenable to invariant-theoretic techniques, identify natural tensor problems that are complete for TOCI, including the equivalence of 2D tensor networks with constant physical dimension, and show that the graph isomorphism problem can be reduced to these complete problems, hence GI$\subseteq$TOCI. As such, our work establishes the first lower bound on the computational complexity of orbit closure intersection problems, and it explains the difficulty of finding unconditional polynomial-time algorithms beyond special cases, as has been observed in the literature.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a definition of Coxeter-Dynkin algebras of canonical type generalising the definition as a path algebra of a quiver. Moreover, we construct two tilting objects over the squid algebra - one via generalised APR-tilting and one via one-point-extensions and reflection functors - and identify their endomorphism algebras with the Coxeter-Dynkin algebra. This shows that our definition gives another representative in the derived equivalence class of the squid algebra, and hence of the corresponding canonical algebra. Finally, we have a closer look at the Grothendieck group and the Euler form which illustrates the connection to Saito's classification of marked extended affine root systems. On the other hand, this enables us to prove that in the domestic case Coxeter-Dynkin algebras are of finite representation type.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent article, Iyama and Marczinzik showed that a lattice is distributive if and only if the incidence algebra is Auslander regular, giving a new connection between homological algebra and lattice theory. In this article we study when a distributive lattice has a pure minimal injective coresolution, a notion first introduced and studied in a work of Ajitabh, Smith and Zhang. We will see that this problem naturally leads to studying when certain antichain modules are perfect modules. We give a classification of perfect antichain modules under the assumption that their canonical antichain resolution is minimal and use this to give a completion classification in lattice theoretic terms of incidence algebras of distributive lattices with pure minimal injective coresolution. We use our results to answer a question raised by Ajitabh, Smith and Zhang by showing that there exist Auslander-Gorenstein polynomial identity rings without a pure injective coresolution.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, for a given Dirichlet character mod $N$ with $4\nmid N$, we give a lower bound of order $\sqrt{s/\log(s)}$ for the dimension of the $\mathbb{Q}(e^{2iπ/N})$-vector space spanned by the values of its $L$-function at integers $\leq s$ of a given parity. We thus generalize a result Fischler proved in 2021, corresponding to the principal character mod 1. To this end, we construct linear combinations of these values of $L$-function with a refined version of Siegel's lemma, and we apply to them a linear independence criterion generalizing the one used by Fischler. To check the assumptions of this criterion, we rely on a ``Shidlovskii's lemma''.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider mod $p$ Hilbert modular forms for a totally real field $F$, viewed as sections of automorphic line bundles on Hilbert modular varieties in prime characteristic $p$. For a Hecke eigenform of arbitrary weight, we prove the existence of an associated two-dimensional representation of the absolute Galois group of $F$. Furthermore, for any such irreducible Galois representation, we formulate a conjecture predicting the set of weights of eigenforms from which it arises. This generalizes Edixhoven's variant of the weight part of Serre's Conjecture (in the case $F = \mathbb{Q}$), and removes the restriction that $p$ be unramified in $F$ from prior work in this direction. We also establish one direction of a conjectural relation with the algebraic analogue of the weight part of Serre's Conjecture in this context. Finally, we prove results towards our conjecture in the case of partial weight one for real quadratic fields $F$ in which $p$ is ramified.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>While Kronecker coefficients $g(λ,μ,ν)$ with bounded rows are polynomial-time computable via lattice-point methods, no explicit closed-form formulas have been obtained for genuinely three-row cases in the 87 years since Murnaghan's foundational work. This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse. We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge. We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \mod 2)$ for all $n \geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.</p></details>

The method also establishes modularity of all lifts of the mod $λ$ representation which are crystalline of Hodge-Tate type $(0,k-1)$.</p></details>

Suppose that $\frakX_0$ admits a lifting $\frakX_n$ over $A_n$ and the absolute Frobenius $\rF_{\frakX_0}:\frakX_0\to \frakX_0$ admits a lifting over $A_1$. Then we show that there is an equivalence between the category of the prismatic crystals of truncation $n$ on $(\frakX_0/A)_{\Prism}$ and the category of $p$-connections over $\frakX_n$, which is compatible with cohomologies. This generalises a previous work of Ogus.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Rosenfeld postulated ``generalized'' projective planes, which exploit a correspondence between rank-one idempotents of Jordan algebras $\mathfrak{J}_3(\mathbb{A})$ and points of projective planes $\mathbb{A}P^2$. The isometry groups of the generalized projective planes (which were later defined rigorously as homogeneous spaces) are entries of the Tits-Freudenthal magic square. Given recent interest in the Dixon algebra $\mathbb{R}\otimes\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}\otimes\mathbb{O}$, we extend Rosenfeld's approach and present three new coset manifolds. These "Dixon-Rosenfeld planes" have isometry algebras that are obtained from Tits' magic formula and involve all tensorial components of the Dixon algebra. We show that these are the only three planes obtainable with Tits' formula that preserve the analogy with Rosenfeld's planes. These non-simple Lie algebras generalize $\mathfrak{f}_{4},\mathfrak{e}_{6},\mathfrak{e}_{7}$ and $\mathfrak{e}_{8}$ for the octonionic plane $\mathbb{O}P^{2}$ and in the octonionic Rosenfeld planes $\left(\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{O}\right)P^{2}$, $\left(\mathbb{H}\otimes\mathbb{O}\right)P^{2}$ and $\left(\mathbb{O}\otimes\mathbb{O}\right)P^{2}$. We finally investigate the relationships between the isometry algebras of the Dixon-Rosenfeld planes and the exceptional Lie algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For certain groups, parabolic subgroups appear as stabilizers of flags of sets or vector spaces. Quotients by these parabolic subgroups represent orbits of flags, and their cardinalities asymptotically reveal entropies (as rates of exponential or superexponential growth). The multiplicative "chain rules" that involve these cardinalities induce, asymptotically, additive analogues for entropies. Many traditional formulas in information theory correspond to quotients of symmetric groups, which are a particular kind of reflection group; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by multinomial coefficients and are asymptotically related to Shannon entropy. One can treat similarly quotients of the general linear groups over a finite field; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by $q$-multinomials and are asymptotically related to the Tsallis 2-entropy. In this contribution, we consider other finite reflection groups as well as the symplectic group as an example of a classical group over a finite field (groups of Lie type). In both cases, the groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams into infinite series of similar groups $A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$ and a finite number of exceptional ones. The $A_n$ series consists of the symmetric groups (reflection case) and general linear groups (Lie case). Some of the other series, studied here from an information-theoretic perspective for the first time, are linked to new entropic functionals.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{M}_n$ be the multiplicative monoid of $n \times n$ matrices over a finite field. The monoid algebra $\mathbf{C}[\mathfrak{M}_n]$ has been studied for several decades. One of the important early results is Kovács' theorem that the two-sided ideal spanned by matrices of rank at most $r$ has a unit. Our most significant result is an explicit formula for this unit. Prior to our work, such a formula was only known in a few examples. We also study the module theory of $\mathbf{C}[\mathfrak{M}_n]$. We explicitly describe the simple modules, and establish induction and restriction rules. We show that the simple decomposition of an arbitrary module can be determined using character theory of finite general linear groups; this relies on a Pieri rule of Gurevich--Howe. We also establish a version of Schur--Weyl duality for $\mathbf{C}[\mathfrak{M}_n]$. Many of these results hold over more general coefficient fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study Dirichlet $L$-functions via discrete analogs $L_n$ arising from the spectral theory of cyclic graphs as $n\rightarrow \infty$. Using a refined Euler-Maclaurin asymptotic expansion due to Sidi, together with an independent polynomiality property of these finite spectral sums at integers, we obtain exact special-value formulas, even starting at $n=1$. This yields new expressions for certain trigonometric sums of interest in physics, and recovers, by a different method, the striking formulas of Xie, Zhao, and Zhao. It also gives infinite families of recursion relations among special values of the Riemann zeta function and of Dirichlet $L$-functions. Concerning zeros, we prove that, for odd primitive characters, a natural asymptotic functional equation for the discrete functions $L_n$ is equivalent to the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for the corresponding Dirichlet $L$-function. We also provide some remarks about the non-existence of possible real zeros.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider several old problems involving the number of prime divisors function $ω(n)$, as well as the related functions $Ω(n)$ and $τ(n)$. Firstly, we show that there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $ω(n+k) \leq Ω(n+k) \ll k$ for all positive integers $k$, establishing a conjecture of Erdős and Straus. Secondly, we show that the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} ω(n)/2^n$ is irrational, settling a conjecture of Erdős. Thirdly, we prove an asymptotic formula conjectured by Erdős, Pomerance and Sárközy for the number of $n\leq x$ satisfying $ω(n)=ω(n+1)$, for almost all $x$, with similar results for $Ω$ and $τ$. Common to the resolution of all these problems is the use of the probabilistic method. For the first problem, this is combined with computations involving a high-dimensional sieve of Maynard-type. For the second and third problems, we instead make use of a general quantitative estimate for two-point correlations of multiplicative functions with a small power of logarithm saving that may be of independent interest. This correlation estimate is derived by using recent work of Pilatte.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $ρ: Γ\to G$ be an Anosov representation, with $Γ$ a word hyperbolic group and $G$ a semisimple Lie group. Previous works (Guichard--Wienhard, Kapovich--Leeb--Porti, and Carvajales--Stecker) constructed an open domain of discontinuity $Ω_ρ\subset G/H$, where $H$ is a parabolic or symmetric subgroup. In this paper, we extend the properly discontinuous $Γ$-action via $ρ$ to the space of connections on the pullbacks of the tangent bundle over $Ω_ρ$. When $Ω_ρ$ is a complex curve, we show that the $Γ$-action is properly discontinuous on the union of Higgs bundle structures associated with the $(1,0)$ part of the complexified pullback bundles. We further construct a free abelian group $F^{ab}$ generated by these holomorphic line bundles and induce a topoogical structure on it, so that $ρ(Γ)$ acts properly discontinuously on $F^{ab} \setminus \{\mathrm{id}\}$. This free abelian group is well-defined up to isomorphism over the character variety of Zariski dense Anosov representations. Finally, we endow the space of Anosov representations with a categorical structure compatible with $Ω_ρ$ and construct a natural functor to the category of abelian groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study the (co)homology of Tanabe algebras, which are a family of subalgebras of the partition algebras exhibiting a Schur-Weyl duality with certain complex reflection groups. The homology of the partition algebras has been shown to be related to the homology of the symmetric groups by Boyd-Hepworth-Patzt and the results they obtain depend on a parameter. In all known results, the homology of a diagram algebra is dependent on one of two things: the invertibility of a parameter in the ground ring or the parity of the positive integer indexing the number of pairs of vertices. We show that the (co)homology of Tanabe algebras is isomorphic to the (co)homology of the symmetric groups and that this is independent of both the parameter and the parity of the index. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a result of this sort. Along the way we will also study the (co)homology of the uniform block permutation algebra and the totally propagating partition algebra as well collecting cohomological analogues of known results for the homology of partition algebras and Jones annular algebras.</p></details>
