 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gabriel Raposo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.PR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of a Young generating function for a probability measure on integer partitions. We use this object to characterize probability distributions over integer partitions satisfying a law of large numbers and those that satisfy a central limit theorem. We further establish a multilevel central limit theorem, which enables the study of random standard Young tableaux. As applications of these results, we describe the fluctuations of height functions associated with (i) the Plancherel growth process, (ii) random standard Young tableaux of fixed shape, and (iii) probability distributions induced by extreme characters of the infinite symmetric group $S_\infty$. In all cases, we identify the limiting fluctuations as a conditioned Gaussian Free Field.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p>3$ be a prime, and let $(\frac{\cdot}p)$ be the Legendre symbol. Let $A_p(x)$ denote the matrix $[x+a_{ij}]_{1\leqslant i,j\leqslant (p-1)/2}$, where $$ a_{ij}=\begin{cases} (\frac{j}{p}) &\text{if} \ i=1, \$\frac{i+j}{p}) &\text{if} \ i>1. \end{cases}$$ In 2018 Z.-W. Sun conjectured that $\det A_p(0)=-2^{(p-3)/2}$ if $p\equiv 3 \pmod{4}$, which was later confirmed by G. Zaimi. In this paper we evaluate $\det A_p(x)$ completely.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** H. E. A. Campbell, R. James Shank, David L. Wehlau &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AC &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** The second version includes number of minor corrections

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe the rings of invariants for the finite orthogonal groups of plus type in odd characteristic acting on the defining representations. We also describe the invariants of the corresponding Sylow subgroups in the defining characteristic. In both cases we construct minimal algebra generating sets and describe the relations among the generators. Both rings of invariants are shown to be complete intersections and thus are Cohen-Macaulay. We expect the techniques we use will generalise to give a systematic computation for rings of invariants for all of the finite classical groups in odd characteristic.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Soniya Takshak, Rajendra Kumar Sharma &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) are used to generate secret keys in stream cipher cryptosystems. There are different kinds of key-stream generators like filter generators, combination generators, clock-controlled generators, etc. For a combination generator, the connection polynomial is the product of the connection polynomials of constituent LFSRs. For better cryptographic properties, the connection polynomials of the constituent LFSRs should be primitive with coprime degrees. The cryptographic systems using LFSRs as their components are vulnerable to correlation attacks. The attack heavily depends on the $t$-nomial multiples of the connection polynomial for small values of $t$. In 2005, Maitra, Gupta, and Venkateswarlu provided a lower bound for the number of $t$-nomial multiples of the product of primitive polynomials over GF(2). The lower bound is exact when $t=3$. In this article, we provide the exact number of $4$-nomial and $5$-nomial multiples of the product of primitive polynomials. This helps us to choose a more suitable connection polynomial to resist the correlation attacks. Next, we disprove a conjecture by Maitra, Gupta, and Venkateswarlu.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sian Nie, Felix Schremmer, Qingchao Yu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cases of Shimura varieties where the special fibre of a Rapoport-Zink space is simply the union of classical Deligne-Lusztig varieties are known as fully Hodge-Newton decomposable ones, and have been studied with great interest in the past. In recent times, the focus has shifted to identify tractable cases beyond the fully Hodge-Newton decomposable ones, and several instances have been identified where only products of classical Deligne-Lusztig varities with simpler spaces occur. In our paper, we provide a uniform framework to capture these phenomena. By studying liftings from the affine flag variety to the loop group and combining them with the Deligne-Lusztig reduction method, our main result is a powerful criterion to show that an affine Deligne-Lusztig variety is the product of a classical Deligne-Lusztig variety with affine spaces and pointed affine spaces. We introduce the class of elements that we call having geometric Coxeter type, strictly including previously studied notions such as positive Coxeter type or finite Coxeter type. These elements of geometric Coxeter type satisfy the conditions for our main result and also a condition on the Newton stratification introduced by Mili\'cevi\'c-Viehmann.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20074v2'>2506.20074</a>\]&nbsp; **A Family of Berndt-Type Integrals and Associated Barnes Multiple Zeta Functions**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Xinyue Gu, Ce Xu, Jianing Zhou &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math-ph &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we focus on calculating a specific class of Berndt integrals, which exclusively involves (hyperbolic) cosine functions. Initially, this integral is transformed into a Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum via contour integration. Subsequently, a function incorporating theta is defined. By employing the residue theorem, the mixed Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum with both hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine in the denominator is converted into a simpler Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum, which contains only hyperbolic cosine or hyperbolic sine in the denominator. The simpler Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum is then evaluated using Jacobi elliptic functions, Fourier series expansions, and Maclaurin series expansions. Ultimately, the result is expressed as a rational polynomial of Gamma and \sqrt{pi}.Additionally, the integral is related to the Barnes multiple zeta function, which provides an alternative method for its calculation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the Sakellaridis-Venkatesh conjecture for the rank-1 spherical variety $X=\text{Spin}_9\backslash F_4$ using an exceptional theta correspondence. We establish the correct transfer map satisfying relative character identities in this case and show that our transfer map agrees with the formula in (Sakellaridis, 2021). Moreover, we show how our techniques lead to a characterization of $X$-relatively cuspidal representations.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Cormac O'Sullivan &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 46 pages, 20 figures. Some improvements and added details in version 3

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work we study, in greater detail than before, J.H. Conway's topographs for integral binary quadratic forms. These are trees in the plane with regions labeled by integers following a simple pattern. Each topograph can display the values of a single form, or represent an equivalence class of forms. We give a new treatment of reduction of forms to canonical equivalence class representatives by employing topographs and a novel continued fraction for complex numbers. This allows uniform reduction for any positive, negative, square or non-square discriminant. Topograph geometry also provides new class number formulas, and short proofs of results of Gauss relating to sums of three squares. Generalizations of the series of Hurwitz for class numbers give evaluations of certain infinite series, summed over the regions or edges of a topograph.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 36 pages, 20 figures, 2 tables. Version 3: improved Remark 33, published version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by categorical representation theory, we define the wiggly complex, whose vertices are arcs wiggling around $n+2$ points on a line, and whose faces are sets of wiggly arcs which are pairwise pointed and non-crossing. The wiggly complex is a $(2n-1)$-dimensional pseudomanifold, whose facets are wiggly pseudotriangulations. We show that wiggly pseudotriangulations are in bijection with wiggly permutations, which are permutations of $[2n]$ avoiding the patterns $(2j-1) \cdots i \cdots (2j)$ for $i < 2j-1$ and $(2j) \cdots k \cdots (2j-1)$ for $k > 2j$. These permutations define the wiggly lattice, an induced sublattice of the weak order. We then prove that the wiggly complex is isomorphic to the boundary complex of the polar of the wigglyhedron, for which we give explicit and simple vertex and facet descriptions. Interestingly, we observe that any Cambrian associahedron is normally equivalent to a well-chosen face of the wigglyhedron. Finally, we recall the correspondence of wiggly arcs with objects in a category, and we develop categorical criteria for a subset of wiggly arcs to form a face of the wiggly complex.</p></details>

Let $P\in A(K)$ be such that $\phi(P)=(Q_1,\dots, Q_m)$ with $\text{Rank}_\mathbb{Z}(\langle Q_1,\dots, Q_m\rangle)=1$. We will study a divisibility sequence related to the point $P$ and show its relation with elliptic divisibility sequences.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Takashi Miyagawa &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 12 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Laurent series expansions of complex functions play a crucial role in analyzing their behavior near poles. In particular, Laurent series expansions have been extensively studied in the theory of zeta-functions. It is well known that the Laurent series expansion of the Riemann zeta-function features the Euler-Stieltjes constants in its coefficients. Similar phenomena occur in the Laurent series expansion of the Hurwitz zeta-function, which is of considerable interest. In this paper, we compute the Laurent series expansions of the Barnes double zeta-function $ \zeta_2 (s, \alpha ; v, w ) $ at $s=1$ and $s=2$, and show that a constant analogous to the Euler-Stieltjes constant appears in the constant term.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Minor changes

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X$ be a smooth projective hypersurface defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. We provide new bounds for rational points of bounded height on $X$. In particular, we show that if $X$ is a smooth projective hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^n$ with $n\geq 4$ and degree $d\geq 50$, then the set of rational points on $X$ of height bounded by $B$ have cardinality $O_{n,d,\varepsilon}(B^{n-2+\varepsilon})$. If $X$ is smooth and has degree $d\geq 6$, we improve the dimension growth conjecture bound. We achieve an analogue result for affine hypersurfaces whose projective closure is smooth.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Erd\H{o}s-Mollin-Walsh conjecture, asserting the nonexistence of three consecutive powerful integers, remains a celebrated open problem in number theory. A natural line of inquiry, following recent work by Chan (2025), is to investigate potential counterexamples centered around perfect cubes, which are themselves powerful. This paper establishes a new non-existence result for a family of such integer triplets with distinct structural constraints, combining techniques from modular arithmetic, $p$-adic valuation, and the theory of elliptic curves.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1914, Hardy proved that there are infinitely many non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ on the critical line Re$(s)=1/2$ using the Jacobi theta relation. In this paper, we first establish a number field analogue of the Jacobi theta relation and as an application, we show the existence of infinitely many non-trivial zeros of the Dedekind zeta function $\zeta_\mathbb{F}(s)$ on Re$(s)=1/2$, for any number field $\mathbb{F}$. Quite interestingly, we also prove that the Jacobi theta relation is equivalent to an intriguing identity of Hardy, Littlewood and Ramanujan.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We generalize the Cannonball Problem by introducing integer-valued and non-increasing arithmetic functions $w$. We associate these functions $w$ with certain polygons, which we call cannonball polygons. Through this correspondence, we show that for any $Z\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists a cannonball polygon with multiplicity 8 and largest side of length $Z$. Moreover, for any multiplicity $s$ greater than 8, we provide an asymptotic formula for the number of distinct classes of cannonball polygons with multiplicity $s$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 76 pages, minor revisions

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a version of the Kloosterman circle method with a bump function that is used to provide asymptotics for weighted representation numbers of nonsingular integral quadratic forms. Unlike many applications of the Kloosterman circle method, we explicitly state some constants in the error terms that depend on the quadratic form. This version of the Kloosterman circle method uses Gauss sums, Kloosterman sums, Sali\'{e} sums, and a principle of nonstationary phase. We briefly discuss a potential application of this version of the Kloosterman circle method to a proof of a strong asymptotic local-global principle for certain Kleinian sphere packings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For positive integers $b\geq 2$, $k<b$, and $t$, we say that an integer $k_b^{(t)}$ is a $b$-repdigit if $k_b^{(t)}$ can be expressed as the digit $k$ repeated $t$ times in base-$b$ representation, i.e., $k_b^{(t)} =k(b^t-1)/(b-1)$. In the case of $k=1$, we say that $1_b^{(t)}$ is a $b$-repunit. In this article, we investigate the existsence of $b$-repdigits and $b$-repunits among the sets of Sierpi\'nski numbers and Riesel numbers. A Sierpi\'nski number is defined as an odd integer $k$ for which $k\cdot 2^n+1$ is composite for all positive integers $n$ and Riesel numbers are similarly defined for the expression $k\cdot 2^n-1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a finite abelian group written multiplicatively, with $\hat{G} = G\sqcup \{0\}$ the pointed abelian group formed by adjoining an absorbing element $0$. There is an associated finitary, proto-abelian category $\mathrm{Vect}_{\hat{G}}$, whose objects can be thought of as finite-dimensional vector spaces over $\hat{G}$. The class of $\hat{G}$-linear monoids are then defined in terms of this category. In this paper, we study the finitary, proto-abelian category $\mathrm{Rep}(M,\hat{G})$ of finite-dimensional $\hat{G}$-linear representations of a $\hat{G}$-linear monoid $M$. Although this category is only a slight modification of the usual category of $M$-modules, it exhibits significantly different behavior for interesting classes of monoids. Assuming that the regular principal factors of $M$ are objects of $\mathrm{Rep}(M,\hat{G})$, we develop a version of the Clifford-Munn-Ponizovski\u i Theorem and classify the $M$ for which each non-zero object of $\mathrm{Rep}(M,\hat{G})$ is a direct sum of simple objects. When $M$ is the endomorphism monoid of an object in $\mathrm{Vect}_{\hat{G}}$, we discuss alternate frameworks for studying its $\hat{G}$-linear representations and contrast the various approaches.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Milad Ghadimi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present the Enhanced Multidimensional Chaotic Heuristic Sieve (EMCHS), a novel probabilistic framework that integrates chaotic perturbations and random matrix theory (RMT) to suggest improved bounds on prime gaps. Building upon the foundational sieves of Goldston-Pintz-Yildirim and Maynard, EMCHS heuristically suggests unconditional gaps of at most 180 and conditional gaps of at most 8 under a partial Elliott-Halberstam conjecture (EHC) with delta = 0.3. These heuristic suggestions surpass Maynard's unconditional bound of 246 through refined polytope optimizations and probabilistic enhancements. We provide rigorous proofs for certain analytic components (such as bounding chaotic perturbations via ergodic theory) and explicitly distinguish which arguments and conclusions are heuristic or conjectural. Numerical evidence for primes up to 10^18 supports the framework, and we discuss limitations and avenues for future rigorous work.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Philibert Nang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Consider $(G, V)$ a finite-dimensional representation of a connected reductive complex Lie group $G$ and $\mathbb{P}\left( V\right) $ the projective space of $V$. Denote by $G'$ the derived subgroup of $G$ and assume that the categorical quotient is one dimensional. In the case where the representation $(G, V)$ is also multiplicity-free, it is known from Howe-Umeda [4] that the algebra of $G$-invariant differential operators $\Gamma\left(V, \mathcal{D}_V\right)^G$ is a commutative polynomial ring. Suppose that the representation $(G, V)$ satisfies the abstract Capelli condition: $(G, V)$ is an irreducible multiplicity-free representation such that the Weyl algebra $\Gamma\left(V, \mathcal{D}_V\right)^G$ is equal to the image of the center of the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathrm{Lie}(G)$ under the differential $\tau: \mathrm{Lie}(G) \longrightarrow \Gamma\left(V, \mathcal{D}_V\right)$ of the $G$-action. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the quotient algebra of all $G'$-invariant differential operators by those vanishing on $G'$-invariant polynomials. The main aim of this paper is to prove that there is an equivalence of categories between the category of regular holonomic $\mathcal{D}_{\mathbb{P}\left( V\right)}$-modules on the complex projective space $\mathbb{P}\left( V\right) $ and the quotient category of finitely generated graded $\mathcal{A}$-modules modulo those supported by $\left\{ 0\right\} $. This result is a generalization of [12, Theorem 3.4] and of [13, Theorem 8]. As an application we give an algebraic/combinatorial classification of regular holonomic $\mathcal{D}_{\mathbb{P}\left( V\right) }$-modules on the projective space of skew-symmetric matrices.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent years, significant progress has been made on Mazur's Program B, with many authors beginning a systematic classification of all possible images of $p$-adic Galois representations attached to elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$. Currently, the classification is only complete for $p \in \{2,3,13,17\}$. The main difficulty for other primes arises from the need to understand elliptic curves whose mod-$p^n$ Galois representations are contained in the normaliser of a non-split Cartan subgroup. Equivalently, this amounts to determining the rational points on the modular curves $X_{ns}^+(p^n)$. Here, we consider the case $p=7$ and show that the modular curve $X_{ns}^+(49)$, of genus 69, has no non-CM rational points. To achieve this, we establish a correspondence between the rational points on $X_{ns}^+(49)$ and the primitive integer solutions of the generalised Fermat equation $a^2 + 28b^3 = 27 c^7$, the resolution of which can be reduced to determining the rational points of several genus-three curves. Furthermore, we reduce the complete classification of $7$-adic images to the determination of the rational points of a single plane quartic.</p></details>

In the same paper he managed to further generalize this, and showed that for all positive rationals $\alpha$ and all positive integers $m$, there exists an $n_{\alpha, m}$ such that every positive integer $n \ge n_{\alpha, m}$ has a partition with distinct parts, all larger than or equal to $m$, and such that the sum of reciprocals is equal to $\alpha$. No attempt was made to estimate the quantity $n_{\alpha, m}$, however.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2015, Van den Bergh showed that complete 3-Calabi-Yau algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 are equivalent to Ginzburg dg algebras associated with quivers with potential. He also proved the natural generalisation to higher dimensions and non-algebraically closed ground fields. The relative version of the notion of Ginzburg dg algebra is that of Ginzburg morphism. For example, every ice quiver with potential gives rise to a Ginzburg morphism. We generalise Van den Bergh's theorem by showing that, under suitable assumptions, any morphism with a relative Calabi-Yau structure is equivalent to a Ginzburg(-Lazaroiu) morphism. In particular, in dimension 3 and over an algebraically closed ground field of characteristic 0, it is given by an ice quiver with potential. Thanks to the work of Bozec-Calaque-Scherotzke, this result can also be viewed as a non-commutative analogue of Joyce-Safronov's Lagrangian neighbourhood theorem in derived symplectic geometry.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop an obstruction theory for the extension of truncated minimal $A$-infinity bimodule structures over truncated minimal $A$-infinity algebras. Obstructions live in far-away pages of a (truncated) fringed spectral sequence of Bousfield--Kan type. The second page of this spectral sequence is mostly given by a new cohomology theory associated to a pair consisting of a graded algebra and a graded bimodule over it. This new cohomology theory fits in a long exact sequence involving the Hochschild cohomology of the algebra and the self-extensions of the bimodule. We show that the second differential of this spectral sequence is given by the Gerstenhaber bracket with a bimodule analogue of the universal Massey product of a minimal $A$-infinity algebra. We also develop a closely-related obstruction theory for truncated minimal $A$-infinity bimodule structures over (the truncation of) a fixed minimal $A$-infinity algebra; the second page of the corresponding spectral sequence is now mostly given by the vector spaces of self-extensions of the underlying graded bimodule and the second differential is described analogously to the previous one. We also establish variants of the above for graded algebras and graded bimodules that are $d$-sparse, that is they are concentrated in degrees that are multiples of a fixed integer $d\geq1$. These obstruction theories are used to establish intrinsic formality and almost formality theorems for differential graded bimodules over differential graded algebras. Our results hold, more generally, in the context of graded operads with multiplication equipped with an associative operadic ideal, examples of which are the endomorphism operad of a graded algebra and the linear endomorphism operad of a pair consisting of a graded algebra and a graded bimodule over it.</p></details>

By developing $p$-adic Hodge theory for general valuation rings, we establish a geometric analogue of Sen's criterion for any $p$-adic analytic Galois extension of $p$-adic varieties: its (Riemann-Zariski) stalkwise perfectoidness is necessary for the non-vanishing of the geometric Sen operators. As the latter is verified for general Shimura varieties by Pan and Camargo, we obtain the perfectoidness of every completed stalk of general Shimura varieties at infinite level at $p$. As an application, we prove that the integral completed cohomology groups vanish in higher degrees, verifying a conjecture of Calegari-Emerton for general Shimura varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\rho: \Gamma \to G$ be an Anosov representation, with $\Gamma$ a word hyperbolic group and $G$ a semisimple Lie group. Previous works (by Guichard--Wienhard, Kapovich--Leeb--Porti, and recently Carvajales--Stecker) constructed an open domain of discontinuity $\Omega_\rho \subset G/H$, where $H$ is a parabolic or symmetric subgroup. In this paper, we extend the properly discontinuous $\Gamma$-action (via $\rho$) to the space of connections on the pullback of the tangent bundle over $\Omega_\rho$. When $\Omega_\rho$ is a complex surface, we show that the $\Gamma$-action is properly discontinuous on the union of the Higgs bundle structures of the $(1,0)$ part of the complexification of these pullback bundles. We further construct a topological free group $F$ generated by these holomorphic line bundles and show that $\rho(\Gamma)$ acts properly discontinuously on $F \setminus \{\mathrm{id}\}$. This free group is shown to be well-defined up to isomorphism over the character variety of Zariski dense Anosov representations. Finally, we endow the space of Anosov representations with a categorical structure and construct a natural functor to the category of free groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a construction of the Coulomb branch of a $3d\ {\mathcal N}=4$ gauge theory corresponding to a choice of a connected reductive group $G$ and a symplectic finite-dimensional reprsentation $\mathbf M$ of $G$, satisfying certain anomaly cancellation condition. This extends the construction of arXiv:1601.03586 (where it was assumed that ${\mathbf M}={\mathbf N}\oplus{\mathbf N}^*$ for some representation $\mathbf N$ of $G$). Our construction goes through certain "universal" ring object in the twisted derived Satake category of the symplectic group $Sp(2n)$. The construction of this object uses a categorical version of the Weil representation; we also compute the image of this object under the (twisted) derived Satake equivalence and show that it can be obtained from the theta-sheaf introduced by S.Lysenko on $\mathrm{Bun}_{Sp(2n)}({\mathbb P}^1)$ via certain Radon transform. We also discuss applications of our construction to a potential mathematical construction of $S$-duality for super-symmetric boundary conditions in 4-dimensional gauge theory and to (some extension of) the conjectures of D.Ben-Zvi, Y.Sakellaridis and A.Venkatesh.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that a vector space valued TQFT constructed in work of De Renzi et al. [DGGPR23] extends naturally to a topological field theory which takes values in the symmetric monoidal category of linear cochains. Specifically, we consider a bordism category whose objects are surfaces with markings from the category of cochains Ch(A) over a given modular tensor category (such as the category of small quantum group representations), and whose morphisms are 3-dimensional bordisms with embedded ribbon graphs traveling between such marked surfaces. We construct a symmetric monoidal functor from the aforementioned ribbon bordism category to the category of linear cochains. The values of this theory on surfaces are identified with Hom complexes for Ch(A), and the 3-manifold invariants are alternating sums of the renormalized Lyubashenko invariant from [DGGPR23]. We show that our cochain valued TQFT furthermore preserves homotopies, and hence localizes to a theory which takes values in the derived $\infty$-category of dg vector spaces. The domain for this $\infty$-categorical theory is, up to some approximation, an $\infty$-category of ribbon bordism with labels in the homotopy $\infty$-category K(A). We suggest our localized theory as a starting point for the construction of a "derived TQFT" for the $\infty$-category of derived quantum group representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let R be a commutative Noetherian local ring. We give a characterization of when the completion of R has an isolated singularity. This result simultaneously improves a theorem of Dao and Takahashi and a theorem of Bahlekeh, Hakimian, Salarian, and Takahashi. As an application, we strengthen the Auslander-Huneke-Leuschke-Wiegand theorem in the form refined by Dao and Takahashi. We further investigate the ascent and descent of finite and countable syzygy representation type along the canonical map from R to its completion. As a consequence, we obtain a complete affirmative answer to Schreyer's conjecture. We also explore analogues of Chen's questions in the context of finite Cohen-Macaulay representation type over Cohen-Macaulay rings. The main result in this direction shows that if R is Cohen-Macaulay and there are only finitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules that are locally free on the punctured spectrum, then either R is a hypersurface or every Gorenstein projective module is projective, and every Gorenstein projective module over the completion of R is a direct sum of finitely generated ones. Finally, we study dominant local rings, introduced by Takahashi, under certain finite representation type conditions, and identify a new class of virtually Gorenstein rings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $S_k$ denote the space of cusp forms of weight $k$ and level one. For $0\leq t\leq k-2$ and primitive Dirichlet character $\chi$ mod $D$, we introduce twisted periods $r_{t,\chi}$ on $S_k$. We show that for a fixed natural number $n$, if $k$ is sufficiently large relative to $n$ and $D$, then any $n$ periods with the same twist but different indices are linearly independent. We also prove that if $k$ is sufficiently large relative to $D$ then any $n$ periods with the same index but different twists mod $D$ are linearly independent. These results are achieved by studying the trace of the products and Rankin-Cohen brackets of Eisenstein series of level $D$ with nebentypus. Moreover, we give two applications of our method. First, we prove certain identities that evaluate convolution sums of twisted divisor functions. Second, we show that Maeda's conjecture implies a non-vanishing result on twisted central $L$-values of normalized Hecke eigenforms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Markov numbers, i.e. positive integers appearing in solutions to $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz$, can be viewed as specializations of cluster variables. The second author and Matsushita gave a generalization of the Markov equation, $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k_1yz + k_2xz + k_3xy = (3+k_1+k_2+k_3)xyz$, whose solutions can be viewed as specializations of cluster variables in generalized cluster algebras. We give two families of matrices in $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}[x_1^\pm,x_2^\pm,x_3^\pm])$ associated to these cluster structures. These matrix formulas relate to previous matrices appearing in the context of Markov numbers, including Cohn matrices and generalized Cohn matrices given by the second author, Maruyama, and Sato, as well as matrices appearing in the context of cluster algebras, including matrix formulas given by Kanatarc{\i} O\u{g}uz and Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m. We provide a classification of the two families of matrices and exhibit an explicit family of each. The latter is done by realizing cluster variables in generalized Markov cluster algebras as weight-generating functions of order ideals in certain fence posets which are related to Christoffel words. An interesting observation is that these functions resemble Caldero-Chapoton functions for string modules, and a byproduct of our proofs is a new skein-like formula for such functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate trace and observability inequalities for Laplace eigenfunctions on the d-dimensional torus, with respect to arbitrary Borel measures $\mu$. Specifically, we characterize the measures $\mu$ for which the inequalities $$ \int |u|^2 d \mu \lesssim \int |u|^2 d x \quad \text{(trace)}, \qquad \int |u|^2 d \mu \gtrsim \int |u|^2 d x \quad \text{(observability)}$$ hold uniformly for all eigenfunctions $u$ of the Laplacian. Sufficient conditions are derived based on the integrability and regularity of $\mu$, while necessary conditions are formulated in terms of the dimension of the support of the measure. These results generalize classical theorems of Zygmund and Bourgain--Rudnick to higher dimensions. Applications include results in the spirit of Cantor--Lebesgue theorems, constraints on quantum limits, and control theory for the Schr\"odinger equation. Our approach combines several tools: the cluster structure of lattice points on spheres; decoupling estimates; and the construction of eigenfunctions exhibiting strong concentration or vanishing behavior, tailored respectively to the trace and observability inequalities.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the group $\mathcal G$ which is the semidirect product of the group of analytic functions with values in ${\mathbb C}^*$ on the circle and the group of analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle that preserve the orientation. Then we construct the central extensions of the group $\mathcal G$ by the group ${\mathbb C}^*$. The first central extension, so-called the determinant central extension, is constructed by means of determinants of linear operators acting in infinite-dimensional locally convex topological $\mathbb C$-vector spaces. Other central extensions are constructed by $\cup$-products of group $1$-cocycles with the application to them the map related with algebraic $K$-theory. We prove in the second cohomology group, i.e. modulo of a group $2$-coboundary, the equality of the $12$th power of the $2$-cocycle constructed by the first central extension and the product of integer powers of the $2$-cocycles constructed above by means of $\cup$-products (in multiplicative notation). As an application of this result we obtain the new topological Riemann-Roch theorem for a complex line bundle $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$, where $\pi :M \to B$ is a fibration in oriented circles. More precisely, we prove that in the group $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ the element $12 \, [ {\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is equal to the element $6 \, \pi_* ( c_1(L) \cup c_1(L))$, where $[{\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is the class of the determinant gerbe on $B$ constructed by $L$ and the determinant central extension.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We revisit and elucidate the $\widehat{A}$-genus, Hirzebruch's $L$-genus and Witten's $W$-genus, cobordism invariants of special classes of manifolds. After slight modification, involving Hecke's trick, we find that the $\widehat{A}$-genus and $L$-genus arise directly from Jacobi's theta function. For every $k\geq 0,$ we obtain exact formulas for the quasimodular expressions of $\widehat{A}_k$ and $L_k$ as ``traces'' of partition Eisenstein series $$ \widehat{\mathcal{A}}_k(\tau)= \mathrm{Tr}_k(\phi_{\widehat{A}};\tau)\ \ \ \ \ \ {\text {and}}\ \ \ \ \ \ \mathcal{L}_k(\tau)= \mathrm{Tr}_k(\phi_L;\tau), $$ which are easily converted to the original topological expressions. Surprisingly, Ramanujan defined twists of the $\widehat{\mathcal{A}}_k(\tau)$ in his ``lost notebook'' in his study of derivatives of theta functions, decades before Borel and Hirzebruch rediscovered them in the context of spin manifolds. In addition, we show that the nonholomorphic $G_2^{\star}$-completion of the characteristic series of the Witten genus is the Jacobi theta function avatar of the $\widehat{A}$-genus.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Expansions of the monadic second-order (MSO) theory of the structure $\langle \mathbb{N} ; < \rangle$ have been a fertile and active area of research ever since the publication of the seminal papers of B\"uchi and Elgot & Rabin on the subject in the 1960s. In the present paper, we establish decidability of the MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N} ; <,P \rangle$, where $P$ ranges over a large class of unary ''dynamical'' predicates, i.e., sets of non-negative values assumed by certain integer linear recurrence sequences. One of our key technical tools is the novel concept of (effective) prodisjunctivity, which we expect may also find independent applications further afield.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 41 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A quasi-hereditary algebra is an algebra equipped with a certain partial order $\unlhd$ on its simple modules. Such a partial order -- called a quasi-hereditary structure -- gives rise to a characteristic tilting module $T_{\unlhd}$ by a classical result due to Ringel. A fundamental question is to determine which tilting modules can be realised as characteristic tilting modules. We answer this question by using the notion of IS-tilting module, which is a pair $(T,\unlhd)$ of a tilting module $T$ and a partial order $\unlhd$ on its direct summands such that iterative idempotent truncation along $\unlhd$ always reveals a simple direct summand. Specifically, we show that a tilting module $T$ is characteristic if, and only if, there is some $\unlhd$ so that $(T,\unlhd)$ is IS-tilting; in which case, we have $T=T_{\unlhd}$. This result enables us to study quasi-hereditary structures using tilting theory. As an application of the above result, we show that, for an algebra $A$, all tilting modules are characteristic if, and only if, $A$ is a quadratic linear Nakayama algebra. Furthermore, for such an $A$, we provide a decomposition of the set of its tilting modules that can be used to derive a recursive formula for enumerating its quasi-hereditary structures. Finally, we describe the quasi-hereditary structures of $A$ via `nodal gluing' and binary tree sequences.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the theory of integral weight harmonic Maass forms of manageable growth, two key differential operators, the Bol operator and the shadow operator, play a fundamental role. Harmonic Maass forms of manageable growth canonically split into two parts, and each operator controls one of these parts. A third operator, called the flipping operator, exchanges the role of these two parts. Maass--Poincar\'e series (of parabolic type) form a convenient basis of negative weight harmonic Maass forms of manageable growth, and flipping has the effect of negating an index. Recently, there has been much interest in locally harmonic Maass forms defined by the first author, Kane, and Kohnen. These are lifts of Poincar\'e series of hyperbolic type, and are intimately related to the Shimura and Shintani lifts. In this note, we prove that a similar property holds for the flipping operator applied to these Poincar\'e series.</p></details>

We prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of $\mathcal{E}$ is exactly $1$. Our proof is number-theoretic in nature and involves M\"obius inversion, summation over coprime convergent denominators, and precise upper bounds derived via continued fraction recurrence relations. As a supplementary result, we rederive the known upper bound of $3/2$ for the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of the relative error-sum function $P(x) \coloneqq \sum_{n \geq 0} (q_n(x)x-p_n(x))$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Uchimura, in 1987, introduced a probability generating function for a random variable $X$ and using properties of this function he discovered an interesting $q$-series identity. He further showed that the $m$-th cumulant with respect to the random variable $X$ is nothing but the generating function for the generalized divisor function $\sigma_{m-1}(n)$. Simon, Crippa, and Collenberg, in 1993, explored the $G_{n,p}$-model of a random acyclic digraph and defined a random variable $\gamma_n^{*}(1)$. Quite interestingly, they found links between limit of its mean and the generating function for the divisor function $d(n)$. Later in 1997, Andrews, Crippa and Simon extended these results using $q$-series techniques. They calculated limit of the mean and variance of the random variable $\gamma_n^{*}(1)$ which correspond to the first and second cumulants. In this paper, we generalize the result of Andrews, Crippa and Simon by calculating limit of the $t$-th cumulant in terms of the generalized divisor function. Furthermore, we also discover limit forms for identities of Uchimura and Dilcher. This provides a fourth side to the Uchimura-Ramanujan-divisor type three way partition identities expounded by the first four authors recently.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1973, Calder\'{o}n proved that an $m \times 2$ positive semidefinite (psd) biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of squares (sos) of ${3m(m+1) \over 2}$ quadratic forms. Very recently, by applying Hilbert's theorem, we proved that a $2 \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of squares of three quadratic forms. This improved Calder\'{o}n's result for $m=2$, and left the sos rank problem of $m \times 2$ biquadratic forms for $m \ge 3$ to further exploration. In this paper, we show that an $m \times n$ psd biquadratic form with a nontrivial zero {can} be expressed as an $(m-1) \times (n-1) \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic form. Furthermore, we show that an $m \times 2$ positive definite (pd) biquadratic form can be expressed as the sum of a square of a quadratic form, and an $(m-1) \times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic form. Thus, the sos rank problem of $m \times 2$ psd biquadratic forms is reduced to the sos rank problem of an $(m-1) \times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic forms. We then show that an $(m-1) \times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic form has at least two nontrivial zeros, and the discriminent of a $2 \times 1 \times 1$ degenerated tripartite quartic form can be expressed as the sum of the square of three cubic forms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we elucidate the advantage of examining the connections between Hilbert-Kamke equations and geometric designs, or Chebyshev-type quadrature, for classical orthogonal polynomials. We first establish that if a $5$-design with $6$ rational points for a symmetric classical measure is parametrized by rational functions, then the corresponding measure should be the Chebyshev measure $(1-t^2)^{-1/2}dt/\pi$ on $(-1,1)$. Our proof is based on the collaboration of a certain polynomial identity and some advanced techniques on the computation of the genus of a certain irreducible curve. Next, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of rational $5$-designs for the Chebyshev measure. Moreover, as one of our main theorems, we construct an infinite family of ideal solutions for the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott (PTE) problem by utilizing rational $5$-designs for the Chebyshev measure, and then establish that, up to affine equivalence over $\mathbb{Q}$, such ideal solutions are included in the famous parametric solutions found by Borwein (2002).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Last passage percolation (LPP) in an $n\times n$ lower triangular domain has nice connections with various generalizations of Schur measures. LPP along an anti-diagonal, from $(1,n)$ to $(n,1)$, gives a distribution of a highest column of a random composition with respect to a Demazure measure (a non-symmetric analog of a Schur measure). LPP along a main diagonal, from $(1,1)$ to $(n,n)$, is distributed as a marginal of a Pfaffian Schur process. In the first case we show that the asymptotics for the constant specialization is governed by the GOE Tracy-Widom distribution, in the second case - by the GSE Tracy-Widom distribution. In the latter case we were also able to study the truncated lower triangular case, obtaining an interesting generalization of the GSE Tracy-Widom distribution.</p></details>

Recall that Shalika's germ expansion of orbital integrals of regular semi-simple elements near the identity, when it exists, is a sum indexed by the set of unipotent conjugacy classes in $G(F)$. Observe that if $G=SL(2)$ this set is always compact; it is finite if $p\ne2$ while it is uncountable if $p= 2$. As a consequence, Shalika's germ expansion for elliptic elements does not make sense if $p=2$. On the other hand the endoscopic expansion of elliptic orbital integrals always exists and yields a germ expansion equivalent if $p\ne2$ (up to a Fourier transform) to Shalika's germ expansion but is new if $p=2$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Digital signatures are essential cryptographic tools that provide authentication and integrity in digital communications. However, privacy-sensitive applications, such as e-voting and digital cash, require more restrictive verification models to ensure confidentiality and control. Strong Designated Verifier Signature (SDVS) schemes address this need by enabling the signer to designate a specific verifier, ensuring that only this party can validate the signature. Existing SDVS constructions are primarily based on number-theoretic assumptions and are therefore vulnerable to quantum attacks. Although post-quantum alternatives, particularly those based on lattices, have been proposed, they often entail large key and signature sizes. In this work, we introduce $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$, a novel isogeny-based SDVS scheme that offers a compact, quantum-resistant alternative. Our construction builds on the ideal class group action framework of CSIDH and the signature techniques of CSI-FiSh, and relies on the hardness of the Multi-Target Group Action Inverse Problem (MT-GAIP). $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$ achieves strong security guarantees; namely, Strong Unforgeability under Chosen-Message Attacks (SUF-CMA), Non-Transferability (NT), and Privacy of Signer's Identity (PSI), in the random oracle model. Remarkably, both the keys and signatures in $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$ are of size $\mathcal{O}(\lambda)$, representing a significant improvement over the typical $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^2)$ bounds in existing post-quantum SDVS schemes, thereby making it among the most compact PQC-based SDVS schemes and the only post-quantum secure construction based on isogenies.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper defines an asymptotic character map which is a morphism from the Grothendieck group of category $\mathcal{O}$ of an integral filtered quantization to rational functions on the Lie algebra of a torus. We show that the asymptotic character of a module computes the equivariant multiplicity of its characteristic cycle. We then apply this construction to truncated shifted Yangians coming from simple, simply-laced Lie algebras and draw connections with characters of modules over KLR algebras using an equivalence of categories of arXiv:1806.07519. Our main theorem shows how this new formalism gives formulas relating equivariant multiplicities of Mirkovi\'{c}-Vilonen cycles and characters of modules over cyclotomic KLR algebras. We explain how this result provides evidence that the change-of-basis between Lusztig's dual canonical basis and the Mirkovi\'{c}-Vilonen basis of $\mathbb{C}[N]$ is computed by a characteristic cycle map whose domain is category $\mathcal{O}$ for truncated shifted Yangians, implying that the coefficients are non-negative integers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a polynomial $f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i$, we study the double discriminant $DD_{n,k} = \mathrm{disc}_{a_k} \mathrm{disc}_x f(x)$, which appears in the proof of the van der Waerden--Bhargava theorem. We conjecture that $DD_{n,k}$ is the product of a square, a cube, and possibly a linear monomial and we prove this when $k=0$. We also investigate the (typically large and smooth) outlying integer constant in the factorization of $DD_{n,k}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Erd\H{o}s first introduced the idea of covering systems in 1950. Since then, much of the work in this area has concentrated on identifying covering systems that meet specific conditions on their moduli. Among the central open problems in this field is the well-known odd covering problem. In this paper, we investigate a variant of that problem, where one odd integer is permitted to appear multiple times as a modulus in the covering system, while all remaining moduli are distinct odd integers greater than 1.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 46 pages, fixed a gap in the proof of Proposition 3.6, using Propositions 2.10 and 2.11

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The descent method is one of the approaches to study the Brauer--Manin obstruction to the local--global principle and to weak approximation on varieties over number fields, by reducing the problem to ``descent varieties''. In recent lecture notes by Wittenberg, he formulated a ``descent conjecture'' for torsors under linear algebraic groups. The present article gives a proof of this conjecture in the case of connected groups, generalizing the toric case from the previous work of Harpaz--Wittenberg. As an application, we deduce directly from Sansuc's work the theorem of Borovoi for homogeneous spaces of connected linear algebraic groups with connected stabilizers. We are also able to reduce the general case to the case of finite (\'etale) torsors. When the set of rational points is replaced by the Chow group of zero-cycles, an analogue of the above conjecture for arbitrary linear algebraic groups is proved.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages, 4 figures. The major change is that the main theorem (Theorem 1.6) is now stated as a purely asymptotic result without explicit constants. This allows significant simplification of the proofs as well as the statements of several lemmas in Sections 3 and 4. There are various minor changes, including to the bibliography and acknowledgements

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>De Loera, O'Neill and Wilburne introduced a general model for random numerical semigroups in which each positive integer is chosen independently with some probability p to be a generator, and proved upper and lower bounds on the expected Frobenius number and expected embedding dimensions. We use a range of probabilistic methods to improve the upper bounds to within a polylogarithmic factor of the lower bounds in each case. As one of the tools to do this, we prove that for any prime q, if A is a random subset of the cyclic group Z_q whose size is of order log(q) and k is also of order log(q), then with high probability the k-fold sumset kA is all of Z_q.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the minimal denominator problem in function fields. In particular, we compute the probability distribution function of the the random variable which returns the degree of the smallest denominator $Q$, for which the ball of a fixed radius around a point contains a rational function of the form $\frac{P}{Q}$. Moreover, we discuss the distribution of the random variable which returns the denominator of minimal degree, as well as higher dimensional and $P$-adic generalizations. This can be viewed as a function field generalization of a paper by Chen and Haynes.</p></details>
