 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jiahe Shen &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.PR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove universality for cokernels of random integral matrices with symmetries via an approach different from the classical surjection moment method introduced by Wood (arXiv:1402.5149). In the symmetric case, we reprove Hodges' universality theorem (arXiv:2311.07078), i.e. the version incorporating the canonical pairing from Wood's setting, and in the alternating case we reprove the local universality theorem of Nguyen-Wood (arXiv:2210.08526). A key advantage of our method is that it is quantitative: we obtain explicit error bounds, which are exponentially small in most regimes, thereby addressing Wood's question on effective convergence rates. Our argument is inspired by Maples' exposure-process and coupling viewpoint (arXiv:1301.1239) and uses a generalized form of Fourier-analytic estimates in the exponentially sharp style of Ferber-Jain-Sah-Sawhney (arXiv:2106.04049).</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01384v2'>2504.01384</a>\]&nbsp; **On the efficient computation of Fourier coefficients of eta-quotients**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Adrian Barquero-Sanchez, Juan Pablo De Rasis, Nicolás Sirolli, Jean Carlos Villegas-Morales &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Fourier coefficients of a negative weight eta-quotient, in many particular cases, and after Sussman in general, are known to be expressible by Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher type series. We show that the central terms of the coefficients of these series can be efficiently computed, showing that they can be expressed in terms of twisted Kloosterman sums, and that they satisfy multiplicativity relations; this extends the results from Lehmer for the partition function. We also give explicit bounds for the tails of these series, needed for effectively computing the aforementioned Fourier coefficients.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Chi Hoi Yip &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 9 pages, revised based on referee comments

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The well-known Van Lint--MacWilliams' conjecture states that if $q$ is an odd prime power, and $A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ such that $0,1 \in A$, $|A|=q$, and $a-b$ is a square for each $a,b \in A$, then $A$ must be the subfield $\mathbb{F}_q$. This conjecture was first proved by Blokhuis and is often phrased in terms of the maximum cliques in Paley graphs of square order. Previously, Asgarli and the author extended Blokhuis' theorem to a larger family of Cayley graphs. In this paper, we give a new simple proof of Blokhuis' theorem and its extensions. More generally, we show that if $S \subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}^*$ has small multiplicative doubling, and $A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ with $0,1 \in A$, $|A|=q$, such that $A-A \subseteq S \cup \{0\}$, then $A=\mathbb{F}_q$. This new result refines and extends several previous works; moreover, our new approach avoids using heavy machinery from number theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Minor corrections

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the problem of covering $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with a finite number of sublattices of finite index, satisfying a simple minimality or non-degeneracy condition. We show how this problem may be viewed as a projective (or homogeneous) version of the well-known problem of covering systems of congruences. We give a construction of minimal coverings which produces many, but not all, minimal coverings, and determine all minimal coverings with at most $8$ sublattices.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19503v3'>2511.19503</a>\]&nbsp; **On Some Generalisations of Gauss Sequences**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sathyanarayan Narayan, N. Uday Kiran &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce integer sequences satisfying new congruence properties inspired by the Euler and Gauss congruences, which we call Euler-Gauss sequences. Noting that every Gauss sequence is an Euler-Gauss sequence, we compare them with certain generalisations of Gauss sequences and provide several counterexamples. Unlike the Gauss sequences, this extended class also contains sequences based on distinct prime factors. In particular, the sequences Smallest Prime Factor (SPF) and Greatest Prime Factor (GPF) sequences (suitably defined at 1), extensively studied by prominent mathematicians such as Erdos and Alladi, arise as examples of this class of Euler-Gauss sequences and not in the class of Gauss sequences. In the latter part of the paper, we obtain q-analogs of the defined Euler-Gauss sequences and establish characteristic properties that reveal their structure and fill gaps in the literature on q-Gauss sequences. In recent works, q-Gauss sequences have been shown to admit interesting combinatorial interpretations and to exhibit the Cyclic Sieving Phenomenon (CSP). Not only do our q-Euler-Gauss sequences satisfy the standard CSP with some restriction, but we also derive a new CSP condition for the SPF and GPF sequences, not hitherto known in the literature.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Martin Klazar &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 17 pages, the terminology of functionals added. Close to final form

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We remind the classical analytical proof of the transcendence of $\mathrm{e}$ due to Hilbert. Then, using formal power series, we give two algebraic semiformal proofs of this result. The first proof is a specialization of the proof of the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem found by Beukers, Bézivin and Robba [2]. The second proof uses improper integrals of formal power series and is due to this author. We explain what ``semiformal'' means and indicate yet another analytical proof of the transcendence of $\mathrm{e}$. Like the two algebraic proofs, this proof avoids uncountable sets. It is due to this author in [7].</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Eric Bach, Jonathan Sorenson &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $x\ge y>0$ be integers. A positive integer is $y$-smooth if all its prime divisors are at most $y$. Let $Ψ(x,y)$ count the number of $y$-smooth integers up to $x$. We present several algorithms that will generate an integer $n\le x$ at random, with known prime factorization, such that $n$ is $y$-smooth. We begin by describing algorithms to compute $Ψ(x,y)$ exactly and to enumerate $y$-smooth integers up to $x$ in lexicographic order by prime divisor. Both of these are based on Buchstab's identity, and were likely known before. Then we present an algorithm that accepts as input a parameter $r$, $0\le r<1$, and returns the integer $n$ that is at position $\lfloor rΨ(x,y)\rfloor$ in the lexicographic ordering of all $y$-smooth integers up to $x$. Here position 0 is the first position. Thus, $n$ is generated uniformly so long as $r$ is chosen uniformly. This algorithm has a running time of $O(Ψ(x,y)\log\log y)$ arithmetic operations. We then explore the tradeoff between speed and rigor. By relaxing the uniformity of the output and allowing for multiple heuristics in our runtime analysis, we improve the running time to $$ O\left( \frac{ (\log x)^3 }{\log\log x} \right)$$ arithmetic operations. We conclude with a sample run by generating a $10000$-smooth integer $\le 10^{100}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a finite group whose order is divisible by the characteristic of a field $k$. If $B$ is a block of $kG$ with defect group $P$, we prove that the space of derivations on $kP$ which are restrictions of derivations on $kG$, modulo inner derivations, is isomorphic to a subspace of $\mathrm{HH}^1(B,B)$. Using this, we provide various group theoretic criteria for the non-vanishing of $\mathrm{HH}^1(B,B)$. In particular, we show $\mathrm{HH}^1(B,B)\neq 0$ for principal blocks having abelian defect group, for all blocks of the symmetric and alternating groups, for blocks of finite groups of Lie type in defining characteristic, and for blocks of general linear groups in any characteristic. Building on this, we show that if $k$ has prime characteristic $p>5$, and if $B$ is any block of $kG$ with Sylow defect group, then $\mathrm{HH}^1(B,B)\neq 0$. By the same method we also prove that if $k$ has prime characteristic $p>5$, then the first Hochschild cohomology group of any twisted group algebra is non-zero.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Rui Han, Yaghoub Rahimi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Rubin's generalized Minkowski--Funk transforms $M_t^α$ on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^n$ give rise, for irrational radii $t=\cos(βπ)$, to a small denominator problem governed by the asymptotic behavior of their spectral multipliers. We show that for Lebesgue-almost every $β$ the corresponding two-sine small divisor inequality has infinitely many solutions, and deduce that $(M_t^α)^{-1}$ is not bounded from $\tilde{H}^{s+ρ+1}(\mathbb{S}^n)$ to $H^s(\mathbb{S}^n)$ in the non-critical case $ρ\neq 0,1$. In the critical cases $ρ\in\{0,1\}$ we prove Rubin's Conjectures 4.4 and 4.7 on the failure of endpoint Sobolev regularity for the inverse transforms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a new construction of tensor product gamma factors for a pair of irreducible representations of $\mathrm{GL}_c\left(\mathbb{F}_q\right)$ and $\mathrm{GL}_k\left(\mathbb{F}_q\right)$. This construction is a finite field analog of a construction of doubling type due to Kaplan in the local field case and due to Ginzburg in the global case, and it only assumes that one of the representations in question is generic. We use this construction to establish a relation between special values of Bessel functions attached to Speh representations of generic principal series representations and twisted matrix Kloosterman sums. Using this relation, we establish the multiplicativity identity of twisted matrix Kloosterman sums.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nataniel Marquis &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 14 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $ρ$ be an $n$-dimensional representation of $\mathcal{G}_{\mathbb{Q}_p}$ over $\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}$. When $ρ$ is generic and a good conjugate, the article "Conjectures and results on modular representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ for a $p$-adic field $K$", by Breuil-Herzig-Hu-Morra-Schraen, introduces the notion of compatibility with $ρ$ for an admissible representation of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. In loc. cit., the five authors also question whether one could recover a representation of $\mathcal{G}_{\mathbb{Q}_p}^{n-1}$, called $\overline{L}^{\boxtimes}(ρ)$ and constructed from $ρ$, from some $Π$ compatible with $ρ$ by using Zábrádi's functor $\mathbf{V}_Δ$. We give a range of results, for an arbitrary $Π$ verifying some "weak" compatibilities with $ρ$, about how badly $\mathbf{V}_Δ(Π)$ behaves. In particular, when $ρ$ is reducible and $n\geq 3$, no $Π$ compatible with $P_ρ$ can verify $\mathbf{V}_Δ(Π)\simeq \overline{L}^{\boxtimes}(ρ)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is an open problem whether $ \binom{2n}{n} $ is divisible by 4 or 9 for all $n>256$. In connection with this, we prove that for a fixed uneven $m$ the asymptotic density of $k$'s such that $ m \nmid \binom{2^{k+1}}{2^{k}} $ is 0. To do so we examine numbers of the form $α^{k}$ in base $p$, where $p$ is a prime and $(α, p)=1$. For every $n$ and $a$ we find an upper bound on the number of $k$'s less than $a$ such that $(α^{k})_p$ contains less than $n$ digits greater than $\frac{p}{2}$. This is done by showing that every sequence of the form $\langle σ_t, \dots, σ_1,σ_0 \rangle$, where $0\leq σ_i<p$ for $i\geq 1$ and $σ_0$ is in the residue class generated by $α$ modulo $p$, occurs at specific places in the representation $(α^k)_p$ as $k$ varies.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By the work of Hernandez-Leclerc, Leclerc-Plamondon, and Keller-Scherotzke, affine graded Nakajima quiver varieties associated with a Dynkin quiver $Q$ admit an algebraic description in terms of modules over the singular Nakajima category $\mathcal{S}$ and a stratification functor to the derived category of $Q$. In this paper, we extend this framework to Nakajima's $n$-fold affine graded tensor product varieties, which allow one to geometrically realize $n$-fold tensor products of standard modules over the quantum affine algebra. We introduce a category of filtrations with splitting of length $n$ of modules over a category and show that it is equivalent to the module category of a triangular matrix category. Applied to the singular Nakajima category, this yields a category $\mathcal{S}^{n\mathrm{-filt}}$ whose modules are parametrized by the points of the $n$-fold tensor product varieties. Generalizing the results of Keller-Scherotzke from $\mathcal{S}$ to $\mathcal{S}^{n\mathrm{-filt}}$, we prove that the stable category of finitely generated Gorenstein projective $\mathcal{S}^{n\mathrm{-filt}}$-modules is triangle equivalent to the derived category of the algebra of $n \times n$ upper triangular matrices over the path algebra of $Q$, and we obtain a corresponding stratification functor.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p(n)$ denote the partition function and define $p(n,k)=\sum_{j=0}^{k}\binom{n-j}{k-j}p(j)$ where $p(0)=1$. We prove that $p(n,k)$ is unimodal and satisfies $p(n,k) < \frac{2.825}{\sqrt{n}}\, 2^n $ for fixed $n\ge 1$ and all $1\le k\le n$. This result has an interesting application: the minimal dimension of a faithful module for a $k$-step nilpotent Lie algebra of dimension $n$ is bounded by $p(n,k)$ and hence by $\frac{3}{\sqrt{n}}\, 2^n $, independently of $k$. So far only the bound $n^{n-1}$ was known. We will also prove that $p(n,n-1)<\sqrt{n}\exp(π\sqrt{2n/3})$ for $n\ge 1$ and $p(n-1,n-1)<\exp (π\sqrt{2n/3} )$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Major update. We give a classification of Sturmian lattices including their hierarchical structure. The construction of aperiodic tile sets is made explicit for any quadratic expansion constants

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give an explicit algorithm to construct aperiodic tile sets based on Sturmian words of quadratic slopes. The method works for any quadratic irrational slope, and we can produce infinitely many aperiodic tile sets whose underlying scaling constant is a unit of any real quadratic field. There are two key ingredients in our construction. The first one is ``Sturmian lattices''; an interesting grid structure generated by Sturmian words that emerged in an aperiodic monotile called Smith Turtle. We shall give a classification of Sturmian lattices. The second is the bounded displacement equivalence of Delone sets, which plays a central role in this construction.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The question of when the derived category of a ring satisfies Brown--Adams representability is revisited via studying the transfer of pure homological dimension along definable functors: it is shown that, for any ring, the pure global dimension of the derived category is at least the pure global dimension of the ring; expanding results of Beligiannis and Keller-Christensen-Neeman. This result is obtained by constructing `change of category' isomorphisms of PExt groups across definable functors. The same isomorphisms illustrate circumstances when one can transfer the property of Brown--Adams representability. We demonstrate how these methods can be used to test whether certain derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves are a Brown category. We also make an investigation into the structure of derived categories of von Neumann regular rings, which are shown in many cases to control Brown--Adams representability; this includes a new proof of the telescope conjecture, and a new and short proof that a coherent ring satisfies Freyd's (strong) generating hypothesis if and only if it is von Neumann regular.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The shape of a number field $K$ of degree $n$ is defined as the equivalence class of the lattice of integers with respect to linear operations that are composites of rotations, reflections, and positive scalar dilations. The shape is a point in the space of shapes $\mathscr{S}_{n-1}$, which is the double quotient $\mathrm{GL}_{n-1}(\mathbb{Z}) \backslash \mathrm{GL}_{n-1}(\mathbb{R}) / \mathrm{GO}_{n-1}(\mathbb{R})$. We investigate the distribution of shapes of pure sextic number fields $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[6]{m})$, ordered by absolute discriminant. Such fields are partitioned into $20$ distinct Types determined by local conditions at $2$ and $3$, and an explicit integral basis is given in each case. For each Type, the shape of $K$ admits an explicit description in terms of shape parameters. Fixing the sign of $m$ and a Type, we prove that the corresponding shapes are equidistributed along a translated torus orbit in the space of shapes. The limiting distribution is given by an explicit measure expressed as the product of a continuous measure and a discrete measure.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A well-known consequence of Schur's theorem is that for $r\in \mathbb{N}$, if $n$ is sufficiently large, then any $r$-colouring of $[n]$ results in monochromatic $a,b,c\in [n]$ such that $ab=c$. In this paper we are interested in the threshold at which the binomial random set $[n]_p$ almost surely inherits this Ramsey-type property. In particular for $r=2$ colours, we show that this threshold lies between $n^{-1/9-o(1)}$ and $n^{-1/11}$. Whilst analogous questions for solutions to (sets of) linear equations are now well understood, our work suggests that both the behaviour of the thresholds and the proof methods needed to determine them differ substantially in the non-linear setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a theory of $p$-adic Néron functions on abelian varieties, depending on various auxiliary choices, and show that the global $p$-adic height functions constructed by Mazur and Tate can be decomposed into a sum of $p$-adic Néron functions if the same auxiliary choices are made. We also consider a decomposition of the $p$-adic height constructed by Coleman and Gross for good reduction, and extended to arbitrary reduction by Colmez and Besser, into a sum of certain local height functions for Jacobians of odd degree genus~$2$ curves. We show that this local height function is equal to the $p$-adic Néron function with the same auxiliary choices, regardless of the reduction type of the curve. This extends work of Balakrishnan and Besser for elliptic curves. When the curve has semistable reduction and the reduction of the Jacobian is ordinary, we also describe the $p$-adic Néron function that arises from the canonical Mazur--Tate splitting explicitly in terms of a generalisation of the $p$-adic sigma function constructed by Blakestad.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It was conjectured by Flynn that there exists a constant $κ$ such that, for any integer $g \ge 2$, any $m \le κg$, there exists a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g$ over $\mathbb Q$ with a rational $m$-torsion point on its Jacobian. Leprévost proved this conjecture with $κ=3$. In this work we prove that given an integer $N$ in the interval $[3g,4g+1]$, $g\ge 3$, satisfying certain partition conditions, there exist parametric families of hyperelliptic Jacobian varieties with a rational torsion point of order $N$. In particular, we establish the existence of such varieties for $N=4g+1$ when $g$ is odd and for $N=4g-1$ when $g$ is even. A few explicit applications of this result produce the first known infinite examples of torsion $13$ when $g=3$, torsion $15$ when $g=4$, and torsion $17,18,21$ when $g=5$. In fact, we show that infinitely many of the latter abelian varieties are absolutely simple.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a new infinite-dimensional Lie superalgebra $\mathcal{S}$ called the super extended Ovsienko--Roger algebra. This algebra is obtained by determining the annihilation superalgebra of the Lie conformal superalgebra $S=S_{\bar0}\oplus S_{\bar{1}}$ with $S_{\bar{0}}=\mathbb{C}[\partial]L\oplus\mathbb{C}[\partial]W$, $S_{\bar{1}}=\mathbb{C}[\partial]G$ and non-trivial $λ$-brackets $[L_λL]=(\partial+2λ)L$, $[L_λG]=(\partial+λ)G$, $[L_λW]=[G_λG]=\partial W$. Then we construct a class of simple restricted $\mathcal{S}$-modules, which are induced from simple modules of some finite dimensional solvable Lie superalgebras under certain conditions. Moreover, we obtain the classification of simple generalized Verma modules over $\mathcal{S}$ and we show that the Verma module of $\mathcal{S}$ is always reducible.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Stone duality establishes a contravariant equivalence between the category of Boolean algebras and the category of compact, Hausdorff, totally disconnected topological spaces (Stone spaces). These spaces are precisely the profinite spaces and form the natural environment for arithmetic objects such as the $p$-adic integers, absolute Galois groups, and profinite completions. In this article we give a rigorous and self-contained development of the construction of the Stone space associated to a Boolean algebra, prove Stone's representation theorem, and describe profinite spaces as inverse limits of finite systems. From there we introduce the Stone--Čech compactification via its universal property and discuss central arithmetic examples (such as $β\mathbb{N}$ and profinite completions), emphasizing their structural role in arithmetic geometry and in the framework of Condensed Mathematics of Clausen--Scholze. The text is aimed at advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students, as well as readers interested in the interface between topology, number theory, and new categorical formulations of topology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A band is a semigroup in which each element is idempotent. In recent years, there has been a lot of activity on the representation theory of the subclass of left regular bands due to connections to Markov chains associated to hyperplane arrangements, oriented matroids, matroids and CAT(0) cube complexes. We prove here that the integral semigroup algebra of a band is isomorphic to the integral path algebra of a quiver modulo an admissible ideal. This leads to a uniform bound quiver presentation for band algebras over all fields. Also, we answer a question of Margolis, Saliola and Steinberg by proving that the integral semigroup algebra of a CW left regular band is isomorphic to the quotient of the integral path algebra of the Hasse diagram of its support semilattice modulo the ideal generated by the sum of all paths of length two. This includes, for example, hyperplane face semigroup algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this follow-up paper, we again inspect a surprising relationship between the set of fixed points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ or $\in \mathbb{Z}_{p}$ or $\in \mathbb{F}_{p}[t]$ and the coefficient $c$, where $K$ is any number field of degree $n > 1$, $p>2$ is any prime, $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ (resp., $\mathbb{F}_{p}[t]$) is the ring of all $p$-adic integers (resp., the ring of all polynomials over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p}$) and $d>2$ is an integer. As before, we again wish to study counting problems which are inspired by advances in arithmetic statistics, and also by Narkiewicz on totally complex $K$-periodic points along with Adam-Fares on $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$-periodic points in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any prime $p\geq 3$ and for any $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$, the average number of distinct fixed points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ (modulo $p\mathbb{Z}_{p}$) is bounded or zero or unbounded as $c\to \infty$ . Motivated further by $\mathbb{F}_{p}(t)$-periodic point-counting result of Benedetto in arithmetic dynamics, we then also find that the average number of fixed points in $\mathbb{F}_{p}[t]$-setting behaves in the same way as in $\mathcal{O}_{K}$-setting. Finally, we then apply here counting and statistical results from arithmetic statistics, and as a result obtain counting and statistical results on irreducible monic ($p$-adic) integer polynomials, number fields and subfields of global function fields arising naturally in our polynomial discrete dynamical settings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider certain families of integers $n$ determined by some congruence condition, such that the global root number of the elliptic curve $E_{-432n^2}: Y^2=X^3-432n^2$ is $1$ for every $n$, however a given $n$ may or may not be a sum of two rational cubes. We give explicit criteria in terms of the $2$-parts and $3$-parts of the ideal class groups of certain cubic number fields to determine whether such an $n$ is a cube sum. In particular, we study integers $n$ divisible by $3$ such that the global root number of $E_{-432n^2}$ is $1$. For example, for a prime $\ell \equiv 7 \pmod{9}$, we show that for $3\ell$ to be a sum of two rational cubes, it is necessary that the ideal class group of $\Q(\sqrt[3]{12\ell})$ contains $\frac{\Z}{6\Z}\oplus \frac{\Z}{3\Z}$ as a subgroup. Moreover, for a positive proportion of primes $\ell \equiv 7 \pmod{9}$, $3\ell$ can not be a sum of two rational cubes. A key ingredient in the proof is to explore the relation between the $2$-Selmer group and the $3$-isogeny Selmer group of $E_{-432n^2}$ with the ideal class groups of appropriate cubic number fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We analyze the non-semisimple category of line operators in Chern-Simons gauge theories based off the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$. Our proposal is that the category of line operators $\mathcal{C}$ can be identified with the derived category of modules for a boundary vertex operator algebra $\mathcal{V}$ realized as a certain infinite-order simple current extension of the affine current algebra $V(\mathfrak{gl}(1|1))$ by boundary monopole operators. By translating this simple current extension of $V(\mathfrak{gl}(1|1))$ to the unrolled, restricted quantum group $\overline{U}^E(\fgl(1|1))$, we show that our category of line operators admits a second description in terms of a quasi-quantum group $\mathcal{A}$ realized by uprolling. We also compare our results across an expected physical duality with the cyclic orbifold of a free, $B$-twisted hypermultiplet and find a slight discrepancy at the level of braiding and associator. We end with a detailed analysis of coupling to background flat $GL(1, \C)$ connections and the resulting category of non-genuine line operators.</p></details>

We build on the work of Creutzig-Lentner-Rupert to this large class of VOAs and extend it since in our case the categories don't have projective objectives and objects can have arbitrary Jordan Hölder length. Our correspondence significantly improves the understanding of the braided tensor category of line defects associated to this class of TQFT, by realizing line defects as modules of a Hopf algebra.

Combining the work of Beilinson-Drinfeld on D-modules and Hecke patterns with the recent work of the author with Dimofte and Py, we show that each of the above categories (more precisely the equivariant version) is monoidal equivalent to a localization of the DG category of modules of a graded Hopf algebra. As a consequence, we give an explicit braided monoidal structure to the derived category of D-modules on $G/G_{ad}$, which when restricted to the heart, recovers the braiding of Bezrukavnikov-Finkelberg-Ostrik.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We formulate a quantum phase space for rotational and nuclear-spin states of rigid molecules. For each nuclear spin isomer, we re-derive the isomer's admissible angular momentum states from molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, introduce its angular position states using quantization theory, and develop a generalized Fourier transform converting between the two. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We discuss two general features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, we quantify when and how an isomer's state space is completely rotation-spin entangled, meaning that it does not admit any separable states. Second, we identify isomers whose position states house an internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline how the fiber can be used as a quantum error-correcting code and discuss scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A Fuchsian group $Γ$ has a modular embedding if its adjoint trace field is a totally real number field and every unbounded Galois conjugate $Γ^σ$ comes equipped with a holomorphic (or conjugate holomorphic) map ${φ^σ: \mathbb{B}^1 \to \mathbb{B}^1}$ intertwining the actions of $Γ$ and $Γ^σ$ on the Poincaré disk $\mathbb{B}^1$. This paper provides the first cocompact nonarithmetic Fuchsian groups with a modular embedding that are not commensurable with a triangle group. The main result, proved using period domains, is that any immersed totally geodesic complex curve on a complex hyperbolic $2$-orbifold has a modular embedding. Another consequence is arithmeticity of totally geodesic curves on finite-volume complex hyperbolic surfaces that are commensurable with quotients of $\mathbb{B}^1$ by the group generated by reflections in quadrilaterals satisfying certain angle conditions.</p></details>

The resulting Clemens complex is more complicated than usual, and leads to particularly interesting effective cone constants, associated with exponentially many polytopes whose volumes appear in the expected formula. Like a jigsaw puzzle, these polytopes fit together to one large polytope. The volume of this polytope appears in the asymptotic formula that we obtain using the universal torsor method via o-minimal structures.</p></details>

Our main result is an analogue of the classical relationship between the Hall algebra of abelian $p$-groups (without pairings) and Hall-Littlewood polynomials. Specifically, we define a module over the classical Hall algebra with basis indexed by groups with pairings, and explicitly relate its structure constants to Hall-Littlewood polynomials at different values of the parameter $t$. We also show certain expectation formulas with respect to Cohen-Lenstra type measures on groups with pairings. In the alternating case this gives a new and simpler proof of previous results of Delaunay-Jouhet.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We survey three settings in which dimensions of intersection cohomology groups of algebraic varieties provide deep combinatorial and representation-theoretic information, and computations of the groups themselves have been made using combinatorial sheaves on finite posets. These settings are (1) intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and their realizations via moment graph sheaves and Soergel bimodules; (2) intersection cohomology of toric varieties, the associated g-polynomials of convex polytopes, and their realization via the theory of intersection cohomology of fans; and (3) intersection cohomology of arrangement Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of matroids, and their realization via intersection cohomology of matroids. In all three settings these constructions are valid in more general situations where the variety does not exist, leading to "intersection cohomology without spaces." We give parallel presentations of these three stories, highlighting applications to KLS-polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ which has good supersingular reduction at the odd prime $p$. We study the variation of Iwasawa invariants and the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-property for signed Selmer groups over $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of an imaginary quadratic number field $K$ that lie inside the $\mathbb{Z}_p^2$-extension $\mathbb{K}_\infty$ of $K$ and are not necessarily cyclotomic. We prove several equivalent criteria for the validity of the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-property which involve the growth of $μ$-invariants of the signed Selmer groups over intermediate shifted $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions in $\mathbb{K}_\infty$, and the boundedness of $λ$-invariants as one runs over $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of $K$ inside $\mathbb{K}_\infty$. We give examples where the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-property holds, and also examples where we can prove that it does not hold. It is striking that although the case of supersingular reduction is much more difficult than the case of ordinary reduction, we get finer results here; moreover, we are able to derive analogous criteria for the validity of the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-property of the classical Selmer group, as well as the fine Selmer group. Many of the properties that we investigate have not been studied before in this non-torsion setting. Further, we study various implications between the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-properties for Selmer groups, signed Selmer groups and fine Selmer groups. We apply our results to a conjecture of Mazur, and prove implications between the $\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-property and Conjectures A and B of Coates and Sujatha.</p></details>

In particular, we prove that any finite subgroup $G \subset\Cr_\Q(2)$ has order $\mid G\mid \le 432$ and Lemma \ref{lemm-17} provides a group of order $432$. We use the modern approach of minimal $G-$surfaces, given a (smooth) rational surface $S\subset\p^2$ defined over $\Q$, we study the finite subgroups $G \subset \Aut_{\Q}(S)$ of automorphisms of $S$. We give the best bound for the order of $G\subset\Aut(S)$ for surfaces with a conic bundle structure invariant by $G$. We also give the best bound for the order of $G\subset \Aut_\Q(S)$ for all rational Del Pezzo surfaces of some given degree. In addition, we give descriptions of the finite subgroups of automorphisms of conic bundles and Del Pezzo surfaces of maximal size.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we consider two infinite parametric families of elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ given by the equations $E_{a,b} : y^{2} = x^{3} - a^{2}x + b^{2}$ and $E^{\prime}_{a,b} : y^{2} = x^{3} - a^{2}x + b^{6}$, where $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$ satisfy certain mild conditions. We prove that the torsion group of $E_{a,b}(\mathbb{Q})$ is trivial and the Mordell-Weil ranks of both $E_{a,b}(\mathbb{Q})$ and $E^{\prime}_{a,b}(\mathbb{Q})$ are at least $3$ for infinitely many choices of $a$ and $b$ by using the Néron-Tate height of a rational point and by exploiting the unit group of the ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$. This is an extension of the results of Brown-Myres and Fujita-Nara where lower bounds of the ranks were provided under the assumption that $a = 1$ or $b = 1$. Also, our families of elliptic curves vastly generalize the curves recently investigated by Hatley and Stack.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a formal analytic proof for a class of non-canonical polynomial continued fractions representing π/4, originally conjectured by the Ramanujan Machine using algorithmic induction [4]. By establishing an explicit correspondence with the ratio of contiguous Gaussian hypergeometric functions 2F1(a, b; c; z), we show that these identities can be derived via a discrete sequence of equivalence transformations. We further prove that the conjectured integer coefficients constitute a symbolically minimal realization of the underlying analytic kernel. Stability analysis confirms that the resulting limit-periodic structures reside strictly within the Worpitzky convergence disk, ensuring absolute convergence. This work demonstrates that such algorithmically discovered identities are not isolated numerical artifacts, but are deeply rooted in the classical theory of hypergeometric transformations.</p></details>

The result is illustrated in the examples of the singlet algebras and of the affine vertex algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at any admissible level, i.e. in particular the Verlinde conjectures in these cases are true. In the latter case it is also explained how to compute the actual fusion rules from knowledge of the Grothendieck ring.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a writeup of a resolution of Erdős Problem #728; this is the first Erdős problem (a problem proposed by Paul Erdős which has been collected in the Erdős Problems website) regarded as fully resolved autonomously by an AI system. The system in question is a combination of GPT-5.2 Pro by OpenAI and Aristotle by Harmonic, operated by Kevin Barreto. The final result of the system is a formal proof written in Lean, which we translate to informal mathematics in the present writeup for wider accessibility. The proved result is as follows. We show a logarithmic-gap phenomenon regarding factorial divisibility: For any constants $0<C_1<C_2$ and $0 < \varepsilon < 1/2$ there exist infinitely many triples $(a,b,n)\in\mathbb N^3$ with $\varepsilon n \le a,b \le (1-\varepsilon)n$ such that $$ a!\,b!\mid n!\,(a+b-n)!\qquad\text{and}\qquad C_1\log n < a+b-n < C_2\log n. $$ The argument reduces this to a binomial divisibility $\binom{m+k}{k}\mid\binom{2m}{m}$ and studies it prime-by-prime. By Kummer's theorem, $ν_p\binom{2m}{m}$ translates into a carry count for doubling $m$ in base $p$. We then employ a counting argument to find, in each scale $[M,2M]$, an integer $m$ whose base-$p$ expansions simultaneously force many carries when doubling $m$, for every prime $p\le 2k$, while avoiding the rare event that one of $m+1,\dots,m+k$ is divisible by an unusually high power of $p$. These "carry-rich but spike-free" choices of $m$ force the needed $p$-adic inequalities and the divisibility. The overall strategy is similar to results regarding divisors of $\binom{2n}{n}$ studied earlier by Erdős and by Pomerance.</p></details>

This formula involves a Dedekind sum. We determine the variance in the case $q=(p-1)/2$. If $p\equiv 3$ mod 4 a Dedekind sum and the class number of $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{-p})$ occur in the respective formula. If $p\equiv 1$ mod 4, the formula may be much more complex since it involves linear combinations of (possibly many) products of two Bernoulli numbers attached to odd characters.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Geometric and Topological Deep Learning are rapidly growing research areas that enhance machine learning through the use of geometric and topological structures. Within this framework, Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) have emerged as a powerful class of operators for encoding symmetries and designing efficient, interpretable neural architectures. Originally introduced in Topological Data Analysis, GENEOs have since found applications in Deep Learning as tools for constructing equivariant models with reduced parameter complexity. GENEOs provide a unifying framework bridging Geometric and Topological Deep Learning and include the operator computing persistence diagrams as a special case. Their theoretical foundations rely on group actions, equivariance, and compactness properties of operator spaces, grounding them in algebra and geometry while enabling both mathematical rigor and practical relevance. While a previous representation theorem characterized linear GENEOs acting on data of the same type, many real-world applications require operators between heterogeneous data spaces. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a new representation theorem for linear GENEOs acting between different perception pairs, based on generalized T-permutant measures. Under mild assumptions on the data domains and group actions, our result provides a complete characterization of such operators. We also prove the compactness and convexity of the space of linear GENEOs. We further demonstrate the practical impact of this theory by applying the proposed framework to improve the performance of autoencoders, highlighting the relevance of GENEOs in modern machine learning applications.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Consider a bounded prism $(A,I)$ and a bounded quasi-l.c.i algebra $R$ over $\overline{A}$. In this paper, for any prism $S/A$ with a surjection $S\to R$ such that $\widehat{\mathbb L}_{\overline{S}/\overline{A}}$ is a $p$-completely flat module over $\overline{S}$, we establish an equivalence of categories between rational Hodge-Tate crystals on $(R/A)_Δ$ and topologically nilpotent integrable connections on the Hodge--Tate cohomology ring $\overlineΔ_{R/S}$. As an application, for a non-zero divisor $a\in \overline{A}$, we introduce the concept of $a$-smallness for a rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystal on $(R/A)_Δ$. Finally, we focus on some special algebras $R$ over $\mathcal O_{\mathbb C_p}$ (or generally, the ring of integers of an algebraic closed and complete non-archimedean field) including all $p$-completely smooth algebras, $p$-complete algebras with semi-stable reductions and geometric valuation rings. By using our equivalence, we analyze the restriction functor from the category of $a$-small rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystals to the category of $v$-vector bundles. This yields some new results in $p$-adic non-abelian Hodge Theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2017, Geordie Williamson proved the existence of counterexamples to James's conjecture on the decomposition matrices of symmetric groups and their Hecke algebras.

Those detected by Williamson remain the only known counterexamples to James's conjecture. In this work, we calculate an explicit new counterexample, occurring in the principal block of the Hecke algebra $\mathscr{H}_{24}$ when $q$ is a primitive fourth root of unity, and give explicit graded decomposition numbers in this case. This is the minimal rank counterexample for $e\neq 2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The McKay correspondence establishes a bijection between the cohomology of a minimal resolution and the irreducible representations of a finite subgroup $Γ\subset \text{SU}(2)$. While traditional proofs rely on static algebraic isomorphisms, we propose a dynamical framework grounded in gauge theory and Morse-Bott theory. We analyze an $S^1$-invariant Morse-Bott function on the minimal resolution, interpreting its gradient flow lines as $1$-parameter families of holonomy representations of flat connections from $Γ$ to $GL(R)$. We conjecture that the flow emanating from a critical submanifold converges asymptotically at the boundary to a specific irreducible representation of $Γ$. This dynamical process explicitly constructs the identification between the cohomology basis and the irreducible representations of $Γ$ prescribed by the McKay correspondence. We prove this conjecture for cyclic cases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Flow cones of a directed acyclic graph admit a family of unimodular triangulations given by Danilov, Karzanov, and Koshevoy (DKK) whose normal fans are related to (generalizations) of the associahedron and permutahedron. A correspondence between these triangulations for certain graphs and maximal cones of a $g$-vector fan of a gentle quiver associated to the graph was discovered by von Bell, Braun, Bruegge, Hanely, Peterson, Serhiyenko, and Yip in 2022. This correspondence has been fruitful in uncovering lattice structures in the triangulations. We start by showing that this correspondence is actually a linear isomorphism. We then consider flow cones of certain graphs with cycles. For this case, we give a DKK-like triangulation of the cone, and extend the correspondence to the finite $g$-vector fan of a corresponding locally gentle quiver. In addition, we extend to cyclic graphs a mysterious result of Postnikov--Stanley and Baldoni--Vergne, giving the volume of flow polytopes of acyclic graphs as the number of certain integer flows on the same graph. We illustrate our results with a two-parameter family of cyclic graphs that includes a cycle graph and nested 2-cycles as special cases. We show that the fans of its DKK-like triangulations are respectively isomorphic to the normal fan of the cyclohedron and of a new polytope with the same $f$-vector but different combinatorial type than the permutahedron.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $γ=0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $δ=0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $γ+δ/e=\mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $γ^{(n)}+δ^{(n)}/e=η^{(n)}$, $n\ge0$ for sequences of constants $γ^{(n)}$, $δ^{(n)}$, and $η^{(n)}$ (given respectively by raw, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). Investigating the $γ^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations (where $γ^{(0)}=1$ and $γ^{(1)}=γ$), we find that at least one of the pair {$γ,γ^{(2)}$} and at least two of each set {$γ,γ^{(n)},γ^{(n+1)},\ldots,γ^{(2n)}$}, for $2\leq n\leq26$, are transcendental, with analogous results for the sequence $Γ^{(n)}(1)=\left(-1\right)^{n}γ^{\left(n\right)}$. We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $η^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent, and therefore transcendental, for all $n\ge0$, implying that at least one of each pair, {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e$} and {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e,δ^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n\ge1$. Further analysis of the $γ^{(n)}$ and $η^{(n)}$ reveals that the values $δ^{(n)}/e$ are transcendental infinitely often with positive asymptotic density. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tildeδ^{(n)}$ and $\tildeη^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $γ^{(n)}+\tildeδ^{(n)}/e=\tildeη^{(n)}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Many challenging questions about the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group, $GT$, are motivated by the fact that this group receives the injective homomorphism (called the Ihara embedding) from the absolute Galois group, $G_Q$, of rational numbers. Although the question about the surjectivity of the Ihara embedding is a very challenging problem, in this paper, we construct a family of finite non-abelian quotients of $GT$ that receive surjective homomorphisms from $G_Q$. We also assemble these finite quotients into an infinite (non-abelian) profinite quotient of $GT$. We prove that the natural homomorphism from $G_Q$ to the resulting profinite group is also surjective. We give an explicit description of this profinite group. To achieve these goals, we used the groupoid $GTSh$ of $GT$-shadows for the gentle version of the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group. This groupoid was introduced in the recent paper by the second author and J. Guynee and the set $Ob(GTSh)$ of objects of $GTSh$ is a poset of certain finite index normal subgroups of the Artin braid group on 3 strands. We introduce a sub-poset $Dih$ of $Ob(GTSh)$ related to the family of dihedral groups and call it the dihedral poset. We show that each element $K$ of $Dih$ is the only object of its connected component in $GTSh$. Using the surjectivity of the cyclotomic character, we prove that, if the order of the dihedral group corresponding to $K$ is a power of 2, then the natural homomorphism from $G_Q$ to the finite group $GTSh(K, K)$ is surjective. We introduce the Lochak-Schneps conditions on morphisms of $GTSh$ and prove that each morphism of $GTSh$ with the target $K$ in $Dih$ satisfies the Lochak-Schneps conditions. Finally, we conjecture that the natural homomorphism from $G_Q$ to the finite group $GTSh(K, K)$ is surjective for every object $K$ of the dihedral poset.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We generalize the torsion vanishing results of Caraiani-Scholze and Koshikawa. Our results apply to the cohomology of general Shimura varieties $(\mathbf{G},X)$ of PEL type $A$ or $C$, localized at a suitable maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ in the spherical Hecke algebra at primes $p$ such that $\mathbf{G}_{\mathbb{Q}_{p}}$ is a group for which we know the Fargues-Scholze local Langlands correspondence is the semi-simplification of a suitably nice local Langlands correspondence. This is accomplished by combining Koshikawa's technique, the theory of geometric Eisenstein series over the Fargues-Fontaine curve, the work of Santos describing the structure of the fibers of the minimally and toroidally compactified Hodge-Tate period morphism for general PEL type Shimura varieties of type $A$ or $C$, and ideas developed by Zhang on comparing Hecke correspondences on the moduli stack of $G$-bundles with the cohomology of Shimura varieties. In the process, we also establish a description of the generic part of the cohomology that bears resemblance to the work of Xiao-Zhu. Moreover, we also construct a filtration on the compactly supported cohomology that differs from Manotovan's filtration in the case that the Shimura variety is non-compact, allowing us to circumvent some of the circumlocutions taken by Cariani-Scholze. Our method showcases a very general strategy for proving such torsion vanishing results, and should bear even more fruit once the inputs are generalized. Motivated by this, we formulate an even more general torsion vanishing conjecture.</p></details>

> **Comment:** with an Appendix by Alexander Bertoloni-Meli. Comments and Corrections welcome! v6: shortened as other results have been incorporated into other papers, weak normalized regularity replaced with regularity significantly strengthening main results

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the geometric Langlands program over function fields, Braverman-Gaitsgory and Laumon constructed geometric Eisenstein functors which geometrize the classical construction of Eisenstein series. Fargues and Scholze very recently constructed a general candidate for the local Langlands correspondence, via a geometric Langlands correspondence occurring over the Fargues-Fontaine curve. We carry some of the theory of geometric Eisenstein series over to the Fargues-Fontaine setting. Namely, given a quasi-split connected reductive group $G/\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ with simply connected derived group and maximal torus $T$, we construct an Eisenstein functor $\mathrm{nEis}(-)$, which takes sheaves on $Bun_{T}$ to sheaves on $Bun_{G}$. We show that, given a sufficiently nice $L$-parameter $φ_{T}: W_{\mathbb{Q}_{p}} \rightarrow \phantom{}^{L}T$, there is a Hecke eigensheaf on $Bun_{G}$ with eigenvalue $φ$, given by applying $\mathrm{nEis}(-)$ to the Hecke eigensheaf $\mathcal{S}_{φ_{T}}$ on $Bun_{T}$ attached to $φ_{T}$ by Fargues and Zou. We show that $\mathrm{nEis}(\mathcal{S}_{φ_{T}})$ interacts well with Verdier duality, and, assuming compatibility of the Fargues-Scholze correspondence with a suitably nice form of the local Langlands correspondence, provide an explicit formula for the stalks of the eigensheaf in terms of parabolic inductions of the character $χ$ attached to $φ_{T}$. This has several surprising consequences. First, it recovers special cases of an averaging formula of Shin for the cohomology of local Shimura varieties with rational coefficients, and generalizes it to the non-minuscule case. Second, it refines the averaging formula in the cases where the parameter $φ$ is sufficiently nice, giving an explicit formula for the degrees of cohomology that certain parabolic inductions sit in, and this refined formula holds even with torsion coefficients.</p></details>

In this work, we classify the orbits of this action in the case of Φ = F_4 in terms of supports of canonical forms. This means that we will present a set S of linear forms such that for any coadjoint orbit there exists a unique form from S belonging to that orbit.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a detailed and mathematically rigorous analysis of the path integrals of chiral fermions supported on holomorphic curves on $T^* \mathbb{C}$ in a general noncommutative instanton background. It is shown that such path integrals can be interpreted as computing instanton analogs of matrix coefficients of monopole scattering matrices. Generalizing the known relation between monopole scattering matrices and $R$-matrices of (shifted) Yangians $\mathsf{Y}(\mathfrak{gl}_r)$, our formalism gives rise to a novel geometric method to calculate $R$-matrices of (shifted) affine Yangians $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_r)$. This may also be viewed as an explicit description of double affine Grassmannian slices by $\infty \times \infty$ matrices, compatible with factorization. Our approach unifies a number of earlier results in the literature, and also leads to interesting new results and conjectures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X\to S$ be a smooth projective morphism. Katz proved the Grothendieck-Katz $p$-curvature conjecture for the Gauss-Manin connection on the $i$-th cohomology of $X/S$: if its $p$-curvature vanishes mod $p$ for infinitely many $p$, then the action of $π_1(S,s)$ on $H^i(X_s, \mathbb{Z})$ factors through a finite group. We prove a non-abelian analogue of this statement: if the $p$-curvature of the isomonodromy foliation on the moduli of flat bundles of rank $r$ on $X/S$ vanishes mod $p$ for infinitely many $p$, then the action of $π_1(S,s)$ on the rank $r$ integral characters of $π_1(X_s)$ factors through a finite group. We deduce many new cases of the Bost/Ekedahl--Shepherd-Barron--Taylor conjecture. The proofs rely on a non-abelian version of Katz's formula, and a non-abelian version of the Hodge index theorem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Euler characteristic of $\ell$-adic local systems on the moduli stack $\mathcal{A}_n$ of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension $n$ associated to algebraic representations of $\mathbf{GSp}_{2n}$, as virtual representations of the absolute Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}$ and the unramified Hecke algebra of $\mathbf{GSp}_{2n}$. To this end we take the last steps of the Ihara-Langlands-Kottwitz method to compute the intersection cohomology of minimal compactifications of Siegel modular varieties in level one, following work of Kottwitz and Morel, proving an unconditional reformulation of Kottwitz' conjecture in this case. This entails proving the existence of $\mathrm{GSpin}$-valued Galois representations associated to certain level one automorphic representations for $\mathbf{PGSp}_{2n}$ and $\mathbf{SO}_{4n}$. As a consequence we prove the existence of $\mathrm{GSpin}$-valued Galois representations associated to level one Siegel eigenforms, a higher genus analogue of theorems of Deligne (genus one) and Weissauer (genus two). Using Morel's work and Franke's spectral sequence we derive explicit formulas expressing the Euler characteristic of compactly supported cohomology of automorphic $\ell$-adic local systems on Siegel modular varieties in terms of intersection cohomology. Specializing to genus three and level one, we prove an explicit conjectural formula of Bergström, Faber and van der Geer for the compactly supported Euler characteristic in terms of spin Galois representations associated to level one Siegel cusp forms. Specializing to trivial local systems we give explicit formulas for the number of points of $\mathcal{A}_n$ over finite fields for all $n \leq 7$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A theorem of Nomizu and van Est computes the cohomology of a compact nilmanifold, or equivalently the group cohomology of an arithmetic subgroup of a unipotent linear algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}$. We prove a similar result for the cohomology of a compact open subgroup of a unipotent linear algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}_{\ell}$ with coefficients in a complex of continuous $\ell$-adic representations. We work with the triangulated categories defined by Ekedahl which play the role of ``derived categories of continuous $\ell$-adic representations''. This is motivated by Pink's formula computing the derived direct image of an $\ell$-adic local system on a Shimura variety in its minimal compactification, and its application to automorphic perverse sheaves on Shimura varieties. The key technical result is the computation of the cohomology with coefficients in a unipotent representation with torsion coefficients by an explicit complex of polynomial cochains which is of finite type.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that there are only finitely many finite fields whose members are the sum of an $n$-potent element and a $5$-potent element. Combining this with the algorithmic results provided by S.D. Cohen {\it et al.}, we confirm in the affirmative the conjecture in \cite{Cohen} concerning all finite fields satisfying this condition. Furthermore, we obtain several elementary results for General problem, proving that the number of finite fields satisfying general condition is also finite.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Classical studies of the Fibonacci sequence focus on its periodicity modulo $m$ (the Pisano periods) with canonical initialization. We investigate instead the complete periodic structure arising from all $m^2$ possible initializations in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. We discover perfect mirror symmetry between the Fibonacci recurrence $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and its parity transform $a_n = - a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and observe fractal self-similarity in the extension from prime to prime power moduli. Additionally, we classify prime moduli based on their quadratic reciprocity and demonstrate that periodic sequences exhibit weight preservation under modular extension. Furthermore, we define a minima distribution $P(n)$ governed by Lucas ratios, which satisfies the symmetric relation $P(n)=P(1-n)$. For cyclotomic recurrences, we propose explicit counting functions for the number of distinct periods with connections to necklace enumeration. These findings imply potential connections to Viswanath's random recurrence, modular forms and L-functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a weak form of formality for differential graded algebras, called $A_3$-formality, for the cohomology of pro-p Demushkin groups at odd primes p. We show that the differential graded $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebras of continuous cochains of Demushkin groups with q-invariant not equal 3 are $A_3$-formal, whereas Demushkin groups with q-invariant 3 are not $A_3$-formal. We prove these results by an explicit computation of the Benson-Krause-Schwede canonical class in Hochschild cohomology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that a criterion for an integral domain to be a principal ideal domain (PID), due to Dedekind and Hasse, can also be applied in quaternion orders, and that it can be used to build a finite algorithm to determine if a given order is a principal left (or right) ideal domain. Using this algorithm, we give an alternative proof that the maximal orders of discriminant 7 and 13, which are non-Euclidean, are PIDs. We also provide a completely arithmetic proof of a result of Gordon Pall that shows that, in an order that is a PID, an element of whose norm is divisible by an integer $m$ always has a left and a right divisor with norm $m$. This easily yields the existence and uniqueness (up to associates) of factorizations of a quaternion modeled on a factorization of its norm.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Kashiwara-Kim-Oh-Park introduced a wide family of monoidal categories of finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras, which provide monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras. In this paper, we prove that, for types $ADE$, some of these categories provide monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras of affine type. Moreover, by means of the combinatorial theory of affine type cluster algebras, we give a complete classification of real and imaginary simple modules in these categories. In particular, we show that, in these cases, the conjecture asserting that real simple modules correspond exactly to cluster monomials holds.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we prove a coherent version of geometric Satake equivalence proposed in Cautis-Williams' work arXiv:2306.03023 for type A. In their work, they studied an abelian version of the classical limit Satake category, namely, the Koszul perverse heart of the categorified Coulomb branch for adjoint representations. In this paper we study a subcategory generated by a collection of simple objects. We endow this subcategory with a neutral Tannakian structure and identify it with the finite dimensional representation category $\mathrm{Rep}({\check{G}})$ for the Langlands dual group ${\check{G}}$. Our method uses tools in Cautis-Williams theory and a Hodge module description of the coherent IC extensions of differential sheaves in Xin's work arXiv:2503.14890.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The extriangulated category is a simultaneous generalization of exact categories and triangulated categories. H. Nakaoka and Y. Palu have proved that the homotopy category of an admissible model structure on a weakly idempotent complete extriangulated category is a triangulated category. Using the classic construction of distinguished triangles given by A. Heller and D. Happel, this paper provides an alternative proof of Nakaoka - Palu Theorem. In fact, the class $Δ$ of distinguished triangles in the present paper and the class $\widetildeΔ$ of distinguished triangles in \cite{NP} have the relation $Δ= - \widetildeΔ$, and hence the two triangulated structures on the homotopy category are isomorphic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The paper is devoted to the study of conditions for the Hausdorff-Besicovitch faithfulness of the family of cylinders generated by Cantor series expansions. We show that there exist subgeometric Cantor series expansions for which the corresponding families of cylinders are not faithful for the Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension on the unit interval. On the other hand we found a rather wide subfamily of subgeometric Cantor series expansions generating faithful families of cylinders. We also study conditions for the Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension preservation on [0;1] by probability distribution functions of random variables with independent symbols of arithmetic Cantor series expansions.</p></details>
