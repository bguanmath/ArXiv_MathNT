### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02285v2'>2510.02285</a>\]&nbsp; **Markov chains on Weyl groups from the geometry of the flag variety**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Persi Diaconis, Calder Morton-Ferguson &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.PR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper studies a basic Markov chain, the Burnside process, on the space of flags $G/B$ with $G = GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $B$ its upper triangular matrices. This gives rise to a shuffling: a Markov chain on the symmetric group realized via the Bruhat decomposition. Actually running and describing this Markov chain requires understanding Springer fibers and the Steinberg variety. The main results give a practical algorithm for all n and q and determine the limiting behavior of the chain when q is large. In describing this behavior, we find interesting connections to the combinatorics of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence and to the geometry of orbital varieties. The construction and description is then carried over to finite Chevalley groups of arbitrary type, describing a new class of Markov chains on Weyl groups.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** William J. Keith, Fabrizio Zanello &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Major revision with respect to the previous version, with the addition of an entirely new part on singular overpartitions. 21 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We continue a series of papers studying the parity of families of eta-quotients, which provide implications for the parity of the partition function as well as an overarching conjecture on related $q$-series. The present article focuses on two classes. One consists of eta-quotients of the form $f_t^3/f_1$, a distinguished case of Andrews' singular overpartitions that has recently attracted attention among researchers. In addition, we investigate the parity of certain pure eta-powers $f_1^t$, appending new results to known density theorems.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages, updated exposition

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study five pencils of projective quartic Delsarte K3 surfaces. Over finite fields, we give explicit formulas for the point counts of each family, written in terms of hypergeometric sums. Over the complex numbers, we match the periods of the corresponding family with hypergeometric differential operators and series. We also obtain a decomposition of the $L$-function of each pencil in terms of hypergeometric $L$-series and Dedekind zeta functions. This gives an explicit description of the hypergeometric motives geometrically realised by each pencil.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A base-$g$ Niven number is a natural number divisible by the sum of its base-$g$ digits. We show that, for any $g\geq 3$, all sufficiently large natural numbers can be written as the sum of three base-$g$ Niven numbers. We also give an asymptotic formula for the number of representations of a sufficiently large integer as the sum of three integers with fixed, close to average, digit sums.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02774v1'>2511.02774</a>\]&nbsp; **Real zeros of $L'(s, χ_d)$**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Youness Lamzouri, Kunjakanan Nath &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 24 pages, 2 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\nu$ be any positive function such that $\nu(x)\to\infty$ as $x\to \infty$. We prove that for almost all fundamental discriminants $d$, $L'(s, \chi_d)$ has at most $(\log\log |d|)( \log\log \log |d|)$ real zeros inside the interval $[1/2+\nu(|d|)/\log |d|, 1]$. Combining this result with a recent work of Klurman, Lamzouri, and Munsch, shows that the number of these zeros equals $(\log\log |d|) (\log\log \log |d|)^{\theta}$ for almost all $d$, where $|\theta|\leq 1$. This comes close to proving a conjecture of Baker and Montgomery, which predicts $\asymp \log\log |d|$ real zeros of $L'(s, \chi_d)$ in the interval $[1/2, 1]$, for almost all $d$. Moreover, assuming a mild hypothesis on the low lying zeros of quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions (which follows from GRH and the one level density conjecture of Katz and Sarnak), we fully resolve the Baker-Montgomery conjecture (up to the $\log\log\log |d|$ factor). We also show, under the same hypothesis, that for almost all $d$, $100\%$ of the real zeros of $L'(s, \chi_d)$ on $[1/2, 1]$ lie to the right of $1/2+\nu(|d|)/\log |d|$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jean-Christophe Pain &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we discuss an alternative approach to determine an asymptotic equivalent of the partial sum of the reciprocals of prime numbers. This well-known result, related to Merten's second theorem, is usually derived through methods similar to those found in Hardy and Wright's book ``An introduction to the theory of numbers'', involving comparisons with integrals. The present proof differs in several respects, combining an equivalent for the partial sum of $\Lambda(m)/m$, where $\Lambda$ denotes the von Mangoldt function, with an application of Abel's summation formula and properties of the second Chebyshev function $\Psi(x)=\sum_{n\le x}\Lambda(n)$. A simple application to the study of integers with large prime factors is also presented. Beyond the pedagogical aspect of this work, the aim is to highlight the complementarity of arithmetic functions and to show that interesting (and nontrivial) results can be obtained by means of elementary methods.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jeremy Booher, Steven R. Groen, Joe Kramer-Miller &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 40 pages, comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article we study the Ekedahl-Oort types of $\Z/2\Z$-Galois covers $\pi:Y \to X$ in characteristic two. When the base curve $X$ is ordinary, we show that the Ekedahl-Oort type of $Y$ is completely determined by the genus of $X$ and the ramification of $\pi$. For a general base curve $X$, we prove bounds on the Ekedahl-Oort depending on the Ekedahl-Oort type of $X$ and the ramification of $\pi$. Along the way, we develop a theory of \emph{enhanced differentials of the second kind}. This theory allows us to study algebraic de Rham cohomology in any characteristic by working directly with differentials, in contrast to the standard \v{C}ech resolution.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Álvaro Sánchez &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 40 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a general method to study representations of quivers over abstract stable homotopy theories (e.g. arbitrary rings, schemes, dg algebras, or ring spectra) in terms of Auslander-Reiten diagrams. For a finite acyclic quiver $Q$ and a stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, we prove an abstract equivalence of the representations $\mathcal{C}^Q$ with a certain mesh $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{Z}Q,\, \mathrm{mesh}}$ of representations of the repetitive quiver $\mathbb{Z}Q$, that we build inductively using abstract reflection functors. This allows to produce, from the symmetries of the Auslander-Reiten quiver, universal autoequivalences of representations $\mathcal{C}^Q$ in any stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, which are the elements of the spectral Picard group of $Q$. In particular, we get abstract versions of key functors in classical representation theory -- e.g. reflection functors, the Auslander-Reiten translation, the Serre functor, etc. Moreover, for representations of trees this enables us to realize the whole derived Picard group over a field as a factor of the spectral Picard group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe the action of the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra $W_{1+\infty}$ and its B-type analogue on Schur and Schur Q-functions, respectively, using formal distributions framework.

> **Comment:** 74 pages. Minor revision from Version 1

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We obtain the $n$th centered moments of one level densities of a large orthogonal family of $L$-functions associated with holomorphic Hecke newforms of level $q$, averaged over $q\sim Q$. We verify the Katz-Sarnak conjecture for these statistics, in the range where the sum of the supports of the Fourier transforms of test functions lies in $(-4, 4)$. In so doing, we need to understand certain phantom oversized terms, which allow us to extract the right off-diagonal contributions. We further need to resolve the combinatorial problem that arises when matching our main terms with random matrix predictions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that an arithmetic path integral over the $\ell$-torsion of a Jacobian $J[\ell]$ is equal to the trace of the Frobenius action on a representation of the Heisenberg group $H(J[\ell])$, up to an explicitly determined sign. This is an arithmetic analogue of trace--path integral formulae which arise in quantum field theory, where path integrals over a space of sections of a fibration over a circle can be expressed as the trace of the monodromy action on a Hilbert space.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime, and let $\mathrm{X}$ be a smooth $p$-adic formal scheme over $\mathrm{Spf} \mathcal{O}_K$ where $K/\mathbf{Q}_p$ is a finite extension. We show that reflexive sheaves on the stack $\mathrm{X}^{\mathrm{Syn}}$ are equivalent to $\mathbf{Z}_p$-lattices in crystalline local systems on the rigid generic fiber $\mathrm{X}_\eta$, and then use this to study the essential image of the \'{e}tale realization functor on the isogeny category of perfect complexes on $\mathrm{X}^{\mathrm{Syn}}$. We also show that when $\mathrm{X}/\mathrm{Spf} \mathcal{O}_K$ is smooth and proper that $\mathsf{Perf}(\mathrm{X}^{\mathrm{Syn}})[1/p]$ is equivalent to a category of admissible filtered $F$-isocrystals in perfect complexes.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages, 7 figures; v3: mistakes corrected, proof of main theorem simplified

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the full Fock--Goncharov conjecture for $\mathcal{A}_{SL_2,\Sigma_{g,p}}$, the $\mathcal{A}$-cluster variety of the moduli of decorated twisted $SL_2$-local systems on triangulable surfaces $\Sigma_{g,p}$ with at least 2 punctures. Equivalently, we show that the tagged skein algebra $Sk^{ta}(\Sigma)$, or the middle cluster algebra $\mathrm{mid}(\mathcal{A})$, coincides with the upper cluster algebra $U(\Sigma)$. Inspired by the work of Shen--Sun--Weng, we introduce the localized cluster variety $\mathring{\mathcal{A}}$ as the algebraic version of the decorated Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}^d(\Sigma)$. We show its global section $\Gamma(\mathring{\mathcal{A}},\mathcal{O}_{\mathring{\mathcal{A}}})$ equals the classical Roger-Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_{q\to1}(\Sigma)$, providing a quantization of $\mathcal{T}^d(\Sigma)$ in terms of the Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_q(\Sigma)$. As a consequence of our geometric characterizations, we deduce normality and the Gorenstein property of the tagged skein algebra $Sk^{ta}(\Sigma)$ and the classical Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_{q\to1}(\Sigma)$, as well as finite generation of upper cluster algebra $U(\Sigma)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 26 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the existence and give a classification of all $d$-tilting bundles (and thus geometric Helices) consisting of line bundles on $d$-dimensional smooth toric Fano DM stacks of Picard number one or two. Here, a $d$-tilting bundle is a tilting bundle whose endomorphism algebra has global dimension $d$ or less. In the case of Picard number one, tilting bundles consisting of line bundles correspond bijectively to non-trivial upper sets in its Picard group equipped with a certain partial order. Moreover, all of them are $d$-tilting bundles and their endomorphisms algebras become $d$-representation infinite algebras of type $\tilde{A}$. Conversely, all such algebras arise in this way. In this sense, we can think of smooth toric Fano DM stacks with Picard number one as geometric models of higher representation infinite algebras of type $\tilde{A}$. Using this geometric model, we give a new combinatorial description to $d$-APR tilting modules of them. In the case of Picard number two, $d$-tilting bundles consisting of line bundles correspond bijectively to pairs $(I,I')$, where $I$ and $I'$ are non-trivial upper sets in certain partially ordered sets. Here, $I$ corresponds to a non-commutative crepant resolution (NCCR) of a certain Gorenstein toric singularity with divisor class group of rank one and $I'$ corresponds to a cut of the quiver of this NCCR. Moreover, the endomorphism algebras of these $d$-tilting bundles also become $d$-representation infinite algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $L/K$ be a cyclic extension of number fields, and let $S$ be a finite set of places of $K$ containing the ramified and Archimedean ones. We say that $L/K$ has the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property if, for any generator $\sigma \in \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$, the kernel of the arithmetic norm map $\mathbf{cl}^S(L) \to \mathbf{cl}^S(K)$ coincides with $(1 - \sigma)\mathbf{cl}^S(L)$. In this article, we first provide a method to verify the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property, which does not require any knowledge of the class group of $L$. Then we investigate a connection between the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property and the Gross-Kuz'min conjecture from Iwasawa theory. In doing so, we derive a new criterion for the Gross-Kuz'min conjecture, related to Fermat quotients and spin symbols of prime ideals, which can easily be checked by explicit computation. We conjecture that, in the totally real case, the condition holds for all but finitely many primes. Finally, we present numerical evidence supporting a heuristic in favor of this conjecture.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ken Ono &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1878, Sylvester proved Cayley's Conjecture that the coefficients of the Gaussian $q$-binomial coefficients are unimodal. In 1990, O'Hara famously discovered a constructive combinatorial proof, and in 2013, Pak and Panova proved the stronger property of strict unimodality for sufficiently large parameters. We move from unimodality to log-concavity and higher degree $ d$ log-concavity, known as Tur\'an inequalities. Although $q$-binomial coefficients are not always log- or degree $d$ log-concave, it's natural to ask to what extent these inequalities hold. In infinite families with limiting aspect ratio bounded away from zero and one, we prove that these stronger inequalities hold uniformly, for each $C>0,$ on the central window $|m-\mu|< C\sigma,$ where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation of the normalized distribution. More generally, we obtain the same conclusions for $q$-multinomial coefficients. These results stem from the asymptotic behavior of normalized Jensen polynomials, which are approximated by Hermite polynomials.</p></details>

We also present an alternative approach for constructing permutation polynomials of the form $x+\gamma Tr_q^{q^d}(x^{q+1}+x^{2q+2})$ for the cases where $q=2^m$, $2\nmid d$ and $ Tr_q^{q^d}(x)=x+x^q+\dots+x^{q^{d-1}}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a curve of genus at least four which is either very general or very general hyperelliptic, we classify all ways in which a power of its Jacobian can be isogenous to a product of Jacobians of curves. As an application, we show that, for a very general principally polarized abelian variety of dimension at least four, or the intermediate Jacobian of a very general cubic threefold, no power is isogenous to a product of Jacobians of curves. This confirms some cases of the Coleman-Oort conjecture. We further deduce from our results some progress on the question whether the integral Hodge conjecture fails for such abelian varieties.</p></details>

Our formula explains all the $K$-linear relations among radicals, which (beyond the ones stemming from the multiplicative group $GK^\times/K^\times$) are generated by relations among roots of unity and single radicals.

> **Comment:** 21 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The orbital bivariate chromatic polynomial, introduced in this article, counts the number of ways to color the vertices of a graph with $\lambda$ colors such that adjacent vertices either receive distinct colors from a set of $\lambda$ colors, or the same color from a distinguished subset of $\lambda-\mu$ colors, up to a group of symmetries. This new graph polynomial simultaneously generalizes the orbital chromatic polynomial due to Cameron and Kayibi (2007) and the bivariate chromatic polynomial due to Dohmen, P\"onitz, and Tittmann (2003). We discuss fundamental properties, and provide expansions of this new polynomial for various families of graphs, including complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, paths, and cycles. Some of these expansions are even new for the orbital chromatic polynomial. In addition to these results, we rediscover Fermat's Little Theorem and a ``Fermat-like'' congruence for Lucas numbers. Finally, we outline several open problems related to the orbital bivariate chromatic polynomial.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(X, d)$ be a compact metric space. Given a countable subset $Q \subset X$, a positive function $R: Q \to \mathbb{R}^+:\xi \mapsto R_{\xi}$, and a non-decreasing function $\phi$, we consider the set $E(Q, R, \phi)$ of points $x \in X$ for which there are infinitely many $\xi \in Q$ satisfying $$d(x, \xi) < \phi(R_{\xi}),$$ yet for any $0<\epsilon<1$, there are only finitely many $\xi \in Q$ such that $$d(x, \xi) < (1-\epsilon)\phi(R_{\xi}).$$ We provide sufficient conditions (which are also necessary under some mild assumptions) for the $s$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of $E(Q, R, \phi)$ to be infinite. This framework generalizes not only the classical set $\mathrm{Exact}(\psi)$ of points exactly $\psi$-approximable by rationals (where $\psi$ is non-increasing), but also certain restricted Diophantine approximation sets.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathrm{OD}_{n}$ be the monoid of all order-preserving functions and order-reversing functions on the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. We describe a quiver presentation for the monoid algebra $\Bbbk\mathrm{OD}_{n}$ where $\Bbbk$ is a field whose characteristic is not 2. We show that the quiver consists of two straightline paths, one with $n-1$ vertices and one with $n$ vertices, and that all compositions of consecutive arrows are equal to $0$. As part of the proof we obtain a complete description of all homomorphisms between induced left Sch\"utzenberger modules of $\Bbbk\mathrm{OD}_{n}$. We also define $\mathrm{COD}_{n}$ to be a covering of $\mathrm{OD}_{n}$ with an artificial distinction between order-preserving and order-reversing constant functions. We show that $\mathrm{COD}_{n}\simeq\mathrm{O}_{n}\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ where $\mathrm{O}_{n}$ is the monoid of all order-preserving functions on the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. Moreover, if $\Bbbk$ is a field whose characteristic is not $2$ we prove that $\Bbbk\mathrm{COD}_{n}\simeq\Bbbk\mathrm{O}_{n}\times\Bbbk\mathrm{O}_{n}$. As a corollary, we deduce that the quiver of $\Bbbk\mathrm{COD}_{n}$ consists of two straightline paths with n vertices, and that all compositions of consecutive arrows are equal to $0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the quantum affine general linear superalgebra $\mathrm{U}_q\big(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{m|n,\mathbf{s}}\big)$ for arbitrary 01-sequences $\mathbf{s}$, using the RTT presentation. We systematically construct the RTT presentation for quantum general linear superalgebra $\mathrm{U}_q\big(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n,\mathbf{s}}\big)$, and derive a PBW basis induced by the action of the braid group, compatible with non-standard parities. We determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for the finite-dimensionality of irreducible representations of $\mathrm{U}_q\big(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n,\mathbf{s}}\big)$ and extend the results to the affine case via the evaluation homomorphism. Specific cases such as $(m,n)=(1,1)$ demonstrate that all finite-dimensional representations are tensor products of typical evaluation representations. This work extends existing representation frameworks and classification methods to encompass arbitrary 01-sequences, establishing the foundation for subsequent research on representations of quantum affine superalgebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this short note, we work in the general framework of supersingular abelian varieties defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. Using Coleman maps constructed by B\"uy\"ukboduk--Lei, we define some objects called ``the multi-signed Mordell-Weil groups" for supersingular abelian varieties, make comments on the structure of the dual of these groups as an Iwasawa module and show a (weak) control theorem. This recovers the case of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ non-ordinary at the prime $p$ with $a_p=0$ studied by Antonio Lei. Using the multi-signed Mordell-Weil groups we define what we call ``the multi-signed Tate-Shafarevich groups" along the cyclotomic tower of $\mathbb{Q}$. Finally we pose some open questions related to our newly defined objects and make a remark on the asymptotic growth of these multi-signed Tate-Shafarevich groups along the cyclotomic tower using an idea of Meng Fai Lim.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article concerns the computational complexity of a fundamental problem in number theory: counting points on curves and surfaces over finite fields. There is no subexponential-time algorithm known and it is unclear if it can be $\mathrm{NP}$-hard. Given a curve, we present the first efficient Arthur-Merlin protocol to certify its point-count, its Jacobian group structure, and its Hasse-Weil zeta function. We extend this result to a smooth projective surface to certify the factor $P_{1}(T)$, corresponding to the first Betti number, of the zeta function; by using the counting oracle. We give the first algorithm to compute $P_{1}(T)$ that is poly($\log q$)-time if the degree $D$ of the input surface is fixed; and in quantum poly($D\log q$)-time in general. Our technique in the curve case, is to sample hash functions using the Weil and Riemann-Roch bounds, to certify the group order of its Jacobian. For higher dimension varieties, we first reduce to the case of a surface, which is fibred as a Lefschetz pencil of hyperplane sections over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. The formalism of vanishing cycles, and the inherent big monodromy, enable us to prove an effective version of Deligne's `theoreme du pgcd' using the hard-Lefschetz theorem and an equidistribution result due to Katz. These reduce our investigations to that of computing the zeta function of a curve, defined over a finite field extension $\mathbb{F}_{Q}/\mathbb{F}_{q}$ of poly-bounded degree. This explicitization of the theory yields the first nontrivial upper bounds on the computational complexity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Robin criterion states that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the inequality $\sigma(n) < e^\gamma n \log \log n$ for all $n>5040$, where $\sigma(n)$ is the sum of divisors of $n$, and $\gamma$ is the Euler--Mascheroni constant. Define the family of functions $$ \sigma^{[k]} (n):=\sum_{[d_1,\dots,d_k]=n}d_1\dots d_k $$ where $[d_1, \dots, d_k]$ is the least common multiple of $d_1, \dots, d_k$.

We prove the following analogue of the Robin criterion: for any $k \geq 2$, the Riemann hypothesis holds if and only if $\sigma^{[k]} (n) < \frac{(e^\gamma n \log \log n)^k}{\zeta(k)}$ for all $n > 2162160$, where $\zeta$ is the Riemann zeta function.</p></details>

The second result assumes both the 'unramified' functional equations and an Euler product, and recovers a Hilbert modular form of the expected level predicted by the shape of the functional equations.

To illustrate, we investigate explicit examples, including the $n$-fold products of the projective spaces, the GIT moduli spaces of points on $\mathbb{P}^1$ and Hessenberg varieties.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a prime number and $n$ a positive integer. Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over a number field $k$. It is known that the local-global divisibility by $p$ holds in $E/k$, but for powers of $p^n$ counterexamples may appear. The validity or the failing of the Hasse principle depends on the elliptic curve $E$ and the field $k$ and, consequently, on the group $\mathrm{Gal}(k(E[p^n])/k)$. For which kind of these groups does the principle hold? For which of them can we find a counterexample? The answer to these questions was known for $n=1,2$, but for $n\geq 3$ they were still open. We show some conditions on the generators of $\mathrm{Gal}(k(E[p^n])/k)$ implying an affirmative answer to the local-global divisibility by $p^n$ in $E$ over $k$, for every $n\geq 2$. We also prove that these conditions are necessary by producing counterexamples in the case when they do not hold. These last results generalize to every power $p^n$, a result obtained by Ranieri for $n=2$.</p></details>

We are especially interested in situations when the resulting lattice is well-rounded.

We also fully classify well-rounded lattices from algebraic conjugates in the 2-dimensional case and present various examples in the 3-dimensional case. Finally, we derive a determinant formula for the resulting lattice in the case when the minimal polynomial of an algebraic number has its Galois group of a particular type.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We classify periodic $Y$-systems of rank 2 satisfying the symplectic property. We find that there are six such $Y$-systems. In all cases, the periodicity follows from the existence of two reddening sequences associated with the time evolution of the $Y$-systems in positive and negative directions, which gives rise to quantum dilogarithm identities associated with Donaldson-Thomas invariants. We also consider $q$-series called the Nahm sums associated with these $Y$-systems. We see that they are included in Zagier's list of rank 2 Nahm sums that are likely to be modular functions. It was recently shown by Wang that they are indeed modular functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Inspired by equivariant homotopy theory, equivariant algebra studies generalisations of G-Mackey functors that do not have all transfer maps (also known as induction maps), for G a finite group. These incomplete Mackey functors have interesting and subtle properties that are more complicated than classical algebra. The levels of incompleteness that occur are indexed by simple combinatorial data known as transfer systems for G, which are refinements of the subgroup relation satisfying certain axioms. The aim of this paper is to generalise the Greenlees--May and Thevenaz--Webb splitting result of rational G-Mackey functors to the incomplete case. By calculating idempotents of the rational incomplete Burnside ring of G, we find the maximal splitting of the category of rational incomplete G-Mackey functors. These splittings are determined by maps of the form H to G in the transfer system. We give an intrinsic definition of the split pieces beyond the idempotent description in order to understand what is the minimal information needed to determine an arbitrary rational incomplete G-Mackey functor. We end the paper with a series of examples of possible splittings and illustrate how simpler transfer systems have fewer terms in the splitting but the split pieces are more complicated.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By a classical result of Gauss and Kuzmin, the frequency with which a string $\mathbf{a}=(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ of positive integers appears in the continued fraction expansion of a random real number is given by $\mu_{GK}({I(\mathbf{a})})$, where $I(\mathbf{a})$ is the set of real numbers in $[0,1)$ whose continued fraction expansion begins with the string $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mu_{GK}$ is the \emph{Gauss--Kuzmin measure}, defined by $\mu_{GK}(I)= \frac{1}{\log 2}\int_I \frac{1}{1+x} dx$, for any interval $I\subseteq[0,1]$. % It is known that the Gauss--Kuzmin measure satisfies the symmetry property $(*)$ $\mu_{GK}(I(\mathbf{a}))=\mu_{GK}(I(\overleftarrow{\mathbf{a}}))$, where $\overleftarrow{\mathbf{a}}=(a_n,\dots,a_1)$ is the reverse of the string $\mathbf{a}$. We show that this property in fact characterizes the Gauss--Kuzmin measure: If $\mu$ is any probability measure with continuous density function on $[0,1]$ satisfying $\mu(I(\mathbf{a}))=\mu(I(\overleftarrow{\mathbf{a}}))$ for all finite strings $\mathbf{a}$, then $\mu=\mu_{GK}$. % We also consider the question whether symmetries analogous to $(*)$ hold for permutations of $\mathbf{a}$ other than the reverse $\overleftarrow{\mathbf{a}}$; we call such a symmetry \emph{nontrivial}. We show that strings $\mathbf{a}$ of length $3$ have no nontrivial symmetries, while for each $n\ge 4$ there exists an infinite family of strings $\mathbf{a}$ of length $n$ that do have nontrivial symmetries. Finally we present numerical data supporting the conjecture that, in an appropriate asymptotic sense, ``almost all'' strings $\mathbf{a}$ have no nontrivial symmetries.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma = 0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta = 0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $\gamma + \delta/e = \mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $\gamma^{(n)} + \delta^{(n)}/e = \eta^{(n)}$; $n \ge 0$ for sequences of constants $\gamma^{(n)}$, $\delta^{(n)}$, and $\eta^{(n)}$ (given respectively by full, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). We first investigate the $\gamma^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations, revealing that at least one of the pair {$\gamma,\gamma^{(2)}$} and at least two of the set {$\gamma,\gamma^{(n)},\gamma^{(n+1)},\ldots,\gamma^{(2n)}$} (for all $n \ge 2$) are transcendental. This result implies $\Gamma^{(n)}(1)$ is transcendental infinitely often for $n \ge 1$. We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $\eta^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent (and therefore transcendental) for all $n \ge 0$, implying further that at least one of each pair, {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e$} and {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e,\delta^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n \ge 1$. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tilde{\delta}^{(n)}$ and $\tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $\gamma^{(n)} + \tilde{\delta}^{(n)}/e = \tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given any vertex operator algebra $ V $ with an automorphism $ g $, we derive a Jacobi identity for an intertwining operator $ \mathcal{Y} $ of type $ \left( \begin{smallmatrix} W_3\\ W_1 \, W_2 \end{smallmatrix}\right) $ when $ W_1 $ is an untwisted $ V $-module, and $ W_2 $ and $ W_3 $ are $ g $-twisted $ V $-modules. We say such an intertwining operator is of $\left(\!\begin{smallmatrix} g\\ 1 \ g \end{smallmatrix}\!\right)$-type. Using the Jacobi identity, we obtain homogeneous linear differential equations satisfied by the multi-series $ \langle w_0, \mathcal{Y}_1(w_1,z_1) \cdots \mathcal{Y}_N(w_N,z_N) w_{N+1} \rangle $ when $ \mathcal{Y}_j $ are of $\left(\!\begin{smallmatrix} g\\ 1 \ g \end{smallmatrix}\!\right)$-type and the modules are $ C_1 $-cofinite and discretely graded. In the special case that $ V $ is an affine vertex operator algebra, we derive the ``twisted KZ equations" and show that its solutions have regular singularities at certain prescribed points when $ g $ has finite order. When $ V $ is general and $ g $ has finite order, we use the theory of regular singular points to prove that the multi-series $ \langle w_0, \mathcal{Y}_1(w_1,z_1) \cdots \mathcal{Y}_N(w_N,z_N) w_{N+1} \rangle $ converges absolutely to a multivalued analytic function when $ |z_1| > \cdots > |z_N| > 0 $ and analytically extends to the region $ z_i, z_i - z_j \neq 0 $. Furthermore, when $ N = 2 $, we show that these multivalued functions have regular singularities at certain prescribed points.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Classical studies of the Fibonacci sequence focus on its periodicity modulo $m$ (the Pisano periods) with canonical initialization. We investigate instead the complete periodic structure arising from all $m^2$ possible initializations in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. We discover perfect chiral symmetry between the Fibonacci recurrence $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and its parity transform $a_n = - a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and observe fractal self-similarity in the extension from prime to prime power moduli. Additionally, we classify prime moduli based on their quadratic reciprocity and demonstrate that periodic sequences exhibit weight preservation under modular extension. Furthermore, we define a minima distribution $P(n)$ governed by Lucas ratios, which satisfies the symmetric relation $P(n)=P(1-n)$. For cyclotomic recurrences, we propose explicit counting functions for the number of distinct periods with connections to necklace enumeration. These findings imply potential connections to Viswanath's random recurrence, modular forms and L-functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a real algebraic group $G$ acting on a linear space $V$, a vector $v\in V$ is called unstable if $0\in \overline{Gv}-Gv$, where the closure is taken with respect to the Zariski topology. A fundamental theorem of Kempf in geometric invariant theory states that $v$ is unstable if and only if there is a one-parameter subgroup $A$ of $G$ such that $Av$ is unstable. Assuming $G$ is a semisimple real algebraic $\mathbb{Q}$-group, we give a new proof to this result using a geometric interpretation of the setting. In the process, we also give a new proof of an effective version of this result by Shah and Yang. Our interpretation involves relating the length of vectors under a linear action to convex functions on certain $\cat$-spaces, and bound the later from below by Busemann functions.</p></details>

We prove that the following statements hold for infinitely many values of $p$. $(2-\varepsilon)$-$\mathsf{GapSVP}_p$ is not in $O\left(2^{O(p)}\cdot n^{O(1)}\right)$-time, unless $\text{P}=\text{NP}$. $(2-\varepsilon)$-$\mathsf{GapSVP}_p$ is not in $O\left(2^{2^{o(p)}}\cdot 2^{o(n)}\right)$-time, unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis is false. The proofs are based on a Karp reduction from a variant of the subset-sum problem that imposes restrictions on vectors orthogonal to the vector of its weights. While more extensive hardness results for the shortest vector problem in all $\ell_p$-norms have already been established under randomized reductions, the results in this paper are fully deterministic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We survey some of the stratification theorems concerning exponential sums over finite fields, especially those due to Katz-Laumon and Fouvry-Katz, as well as some of their applications. Moreover, motivated partly by recent work of Bonolis, Pierce and Woo (arXiv:2505.11226), we prove that these stratification statements admit uniform variants in families, both algebraically and analytically. The paper includes an Appendix by Forey, Fres\'an and Kowalski (excerpted from arXiv:2109.11961), which provides an elementary intuitive introduction to trace functions in more than one variable over finite fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $R$ be a principal ideal local ring of finite length with a finite residue field of odd characteristic. Let $G(R)$ denote either the general linear group or the general unitary group of degree two over $R$. We study the decomposition of tensor products of irreducible representations of $G(R)$. It is known that the irreducible representations of $G(R)$ are built from certain distinguished regular representations, which are classified into three types: cuspidal, split semisimple, and split non-semisimple. We prove that the tensor product of any two regular irreducible representations of distinct types has irreducible constituents with multiplicity at most two. Moreover, we show that the regular part of the tensor product of a cuspidal representation with any other regular representation is multiplicity free. When both factors are of split semisimple type, we show that the multiplicity of any regular irreducible constituent is at most $\mathrm{length}(R) + 1$, and that this bound is achieved only when the constituent is also split semisimple. In contrast, we demonstrate that the multiplicity in the tensor product of two split non-semisimple representations can grow with the cardinality of the residue field when the length of the ring is at least two. In the case when $R$ is a finite field, all such tensor product multiplicities are uniformly bounded above by two. This highlights a significant difference between the behaviour of tensor products in the field case and in the more general finite local ring setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Plumbing spaces have drawn significant attention among symplectic topologists due to their natural occurrence as examples of Weinstein manifolds. In our paper, we provide a general formula for the wrapped Fukaya category of plumbings (with arbitrary grading structure) of cotangent bundles along any quiver. Our approach relies on "local-to-global" computations. Specifically, we compute the wrapped Fukaya category of "plumbing sectors" that serve as local models for the singularities of Lagrangian skeletons of plumbing spaces. As corollaries, we fully describe the wrapped Fukaya category of plumbing spaces in dimension $4$ and plumbings of $T^*S^n$ for $n \geq 3$. We show that any Ginzburg dg algebra/category of a graded quiver without potential is equivalent to the wrapped Fukaya category of a plumbing of $T^*S^n$ (with the corresponding grading structure).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an Andr\'e--Oort-type result for a family of hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^n$ that is both uniform and effective. Let $K_*$ denote the single exceptional imaginary quadratic field which occurs in the Siegel--Tatuzawa lower bound for the class number. We prove that, for $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, there exists an effective constant $c(m, n)>0$ with the following property: if pairwise distinct singular moduli $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ with respective discriminants $\Delta_1, \ldots, \Delta_n$ are such that $a_1 x_1^m + \ldots + a_n x_n^m \in \mathbb{Q}$ for some $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in \mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0\}$ and $\# \{ \Delta_i : \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta_i}) = K_*\} \leq 1$, then $\max_i \lvert \Delta_i \rvert \leq c(m, n)$. In addition, we prove an unconditional and completely explicit version of this result when $(m, n) = (1, 3)$ and thereby determine all the triples $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ of singular moduli such that $a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 \in \mathbb{Q}$ for some $a_1, a_2, a_3 \in \mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0\}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We say a power series $a_0+a_1q+a_2q^2+\cdots$ is \emph{multiplicative} if $n\mapsto a_n/a_1$ for positive integers $n$ is a multiplicative function. Given the Eisenstein series $E_{2k}(q)$, we consider formal multiplicative power series $g(q)$ such that the product $E_{2k}(q)g(q)$ is also multiplicative. For fixed $k$, this requirement leads to an infinite system of polynomial equations in the coefficients of $g(q)$. The initial coefficients can be analyzed using elimination theory. Using the theory of modular forms, we prove that each solution for the initial coefficients of $g(q)$ leads to one and only one solution for the whole power series, which is always a quasimodular form. In this way, we determine all solutions of the system for $k \le 20$. For general $k$, we can regard the system of polynomial equations as living over a symbolic ring. Although this system is beyond the reach of computer algebra packages, we can use a specialization argument to prove it is generically inconsistent. This is delicate because resultants commute with specialization only when the leading coefficients do not specialize to $0$. Using a Newton polygon argument, we are able to compute the relevant degrees and justify the claim that for $k$ sufficiently large, there are no solutions. These results support the conjecture that $E_{2k}(q)g(q)$ can be multiplicative only for $k = 2, 3, 4, 5, 7$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fres\'an and Jossen have given a negative answer to a question of Siegel about the representability of every $E$-function as a polynomial with algebraic coefficients in $E$-functions of type ${}_pF_q[\underline{a};\underline{b};\gamma x^{q-p+1}]$ with $q\geq p\geq 0$, $\gamma \in \overline{\mathbb Q}$ and rational parameters $\underline{a}, \underline{b}$. In this paper, we study, in a more general context, a similar question for $G$-functions asked by Fischler and the second author: can every $G$-function be represented as a polynomial with algebraic coefficients in $G$-functions of type $\mu(x)\cdot {}_pF_{p-1}[\underline{a};\underline{b};\lambda(x)]$ with $p\ge 1$, rational parameters $\underline{a},\underline{b}$ and $\mu,\lambda$ algebraic over $\mathbb Q(x)$ with $\lambda(0)=0$? They have shown the answer to be negative under a generalization of Grothendieck's Period Conjecture and a technical assumption on the~$\lambda$'s. Using differential Galois theory, we prove that, for every $N\in \mathbb N$, there exists a $G$-function which can not be represented as a rational function with coefficients in $\overline{\mathbb C(x)}$ of solutions of linear differential equations with coefficients in $\mathbb C(x)$ and at most $N$ singularities in $\mathbb{P}^1 (\mathbb C)$. As a corollary, we deduce that not all $G$-functions can be represented as a rational function in hypergeometric series of the above mentioned type, when the $\lambda$'s are rational functions with degrees of their numerators and denominators bounded by an arbitrarily large fixed constant. This provides an unconditional negative answer to the question asked by Fischler and the second author for such~$\lambda$'s.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 78 pages. Corrected a mistake in Lemma 6.17 of the previous version and in Section 8

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We explore an analogy between, on one hand, the notions of integral closure of ideals and Rees valuations in commutative algebra and, on the other hand, the notions of spectral seminorm and Shilov boundary in nonarchimedean geometry. For any Tate ring $\mathcal{A}$ with a Noetherian ring of definition $\mathcal{A}_{0}$ and pseudo-uniformizer $\varpi\in\mathcal{A}_{0}$, we prove that the Shilov boundary for $\mathcal{A}$ naturally coincides with the set of Rees valuation rings of the principal ideal $(\varpi)_{\mathcal{A}_{0}}$ of $\mathcal{A}_{0}$. Furthermore, we characterize the Shilov boundary for a wide class of Tate rings by means of minimal open prime ideals in the subring of power-bounded elements. For affinoid algebras, in the sense of Tate, whose underlying rings are integral domains, this recovers a well-known result of Berkovich. Moreover, under some mild assumptions, we prove stability of our characterization of the Shilov boundary under (completed) integral extensions. In particular, for every mixed-characteristic Noetherian domain $R$, we obtain a description of the Shilov boundary for the Tate ring $\widehat{R^{+}}[p^{-1}]$, where $\widehat{R^{+}}$ is the $p$-adic completion of the absolute integral closure of the domain $R$.</p></details>

And started at general $x$, it mixes in at most $\log n$ steps in $\ell^1$. But, in $\ell^2$, it takes $\frac{n}{\log n}$ steps for most starting $x$. An interesting connection to Schur--Weyl duality between $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ and $S_n$ further allows for analysis of the mixing time from arbitrary starting states.</p></details>

The inclusion of the space of holomorphic $G$-maps $X\to Y$ into the space of continuous $K$-maps $X\to Y$ is a weak homotopy equivalence with respect to the compact-open topology. The proof is divided into a homotopy-theoretic part, which is handled by an abstract theorem of Studer, and an analytic part, for which we prove equivariant versions of the homotopy approximation theorem and the nonlinear splitting lemma that are key tools in Oka theory.

We remove this assumption. Grouping the transfer matrices in pairs and working to second order on the logarithm of the product, after extracting the common linear phase along the dominant direction, yields a quadratic tail $T^2\sum_{j>L-2h} f(F_j)^2$, or, in a flexible variant, the split tail $T\sum_{|f(F_j)|>1/T}|f(F_j)| + T^2\sum_{|f(F_j)|\le 1/T} f(F_j)^2$.

The methods that are used in the unitary case are described in this paper. A character has a well defined unitary discriminant, if and only if it is unitary stable, i.e. all irreducible unitary constituents have even degree. Computations for large degree characters are only possible because of a new method called {\em unitary condensation}. A suitable automorphism helps to single out a square class of the real subfield of the character field consisting of representatives of the discriminant of the invariant Hermitian forms. This square class can then be determined modulo enough primes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we undertake a systematic analysis of a class of hexanomial functions over finite fields of characteristic 2 proposed by Dillon in 2006 as potential candidates for almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions, pushing the analysis a lot further than what has been done via the partial APN concept in (Budaghyan et al., DCC 2020). These functions, defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ where $q=2^n$, have the form $F(x) = x(Ax^2 + Bx^q + Cx^{2q}) + x^2(Dx^q + Ex^{2q}) + x^{3q}.$ Using algebraic number theory and methods on algebraic varieties over finite fields, we establish necessary conditions on the coefficients $A, B, C, D, E$ that must hold for the corresponding function to be APN. Our main contribution is a comprehensive case-by-case analysis that systematically excludes large classes of Dillon's hexanomials from being APN based on the vanishing patterns of certain key polynomials in the coefficients. Through a combination of number theory, algebraic-geometric techniques and computational verification, we identify specific algebraic obstructions-including the existence of absolutely irreducible components in associated varieties and degree incompatibilities in polynomial factorizations-that prevent these functions from achieving optimal differential uniformity. Our results significantly narrow the search space for new APN functions within this family and provide a theoretical roadmap applicable to other classes of potential APN functions. We complement our theoretical work with extensive computations. Through exhaustive searches on $\mathbb{F}_{2^2}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^4}$ and random sampling on $\mathbb{F}_{2^6}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^8}$, we identified thousands of APN hexanomials, many of which are not CCZ-equivalent to the known Budaghyan-Carlet family (Budaghyan-Carlet, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th., 2008).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The main objective of this project is to determine all irreducible modules of a given modular Lie algebra. In contrast to ordinary Lie algebras, modular Lie algebras require an additional structure known as the p-mapping. The minimal p-envelope of a modular Lie algebra is restrictable, and there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the induced modules and certain original modules. By exploiting the properties of induced modules, this project aims to decompose a modular Lie algebra L into irreducible L- modules. Several examples will be presented to demonstrate how such decompositions can be achieved for specific modular Lie algebras.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 34 pages; added clarifications and references

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Refined BPS indices give rise to a quantum Riemann-Hilbert problem that is inherently related to a non-commutative deformation of moduli spaces arising in gauge and string theory compactifications. We reformulate this problem in terms of a non-commutative deformation of a TBA-like equation and obtain its formal solution as an expansion in refined indices. As an application of this construction, we derive a generating function of solutions of the TBA equation in the unrefined case.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 48 pages. Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that odd Khovanov homology carries an action of the super Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$, given extra choice of markings on the link. Moreover, we show that this action arises from an action on super $\mathfrak{gl}_{2}$-foams, in the extended-TQFT framework developed by the second author and Vaz; in particular, it extends to tangles. Finally, we relate the action to torsion $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ in pretzel links $P(n,n,-n)$. In particular, this shows that all torsion can appear in odd Khovanov homology.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a complex simple Lie algebra and $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$ the corresponding quantum affine algebra. We prove that every irreducible finite-dimensional $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$-module gives rise to a family of trigonometric solutions of Cherednik's generalized reflection equation. These depend upon the choice of a quantum affine symmetric pair $U_q(\mathfrak{k})\subset U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$. Our result relies on the construction of universal K-matrices for arbitrary quantum symmetric pairs, obtained in our previous work, as well as the fact that every irreducible $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$-module is generically irreducible under restriction to $U_q({\mathfrak{k}})$. In the case of small modules and Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules, we obtain new solutions of the standard and the transposed reflection equations.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-02 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Pawan Singh Mehta, Biswajyoti Saha &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we study the analytic properties of the multiple polylogarithms in the $s$-aspect. Although the domain of absolute convergence of the series defining the multiple polylogarithms is well-known, the study towards a larger open domain of (conditional) convergence has been limited, particularly when the depth is $\ge 2$. Here, we exhibit a larger open domain of (conditional) convergence for this series by writing certain translation formulas satisfied by them. The series moreover defines a holomorphic function in this open set. We then introduce a regularisation process for the multiple polylogarithms, extending an earlier work of the second author. This regularisation process requires a generalisation of the Euler-Boole summation formula that we derive in the appendix of this article. The regularisation process leads to a larger open domain, where the series (conditionally) converges at integer points. The holomorphicity at such points is a more delicate question and this regularisation process is to be used to study the local behaviour of the multiple polylogarithms around such points.</p></details>
