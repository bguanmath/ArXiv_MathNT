### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08785v2'>2403.08785</a>\]&nbsp; **On finite group scheme-theoretical categories, II**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Shlomo Gelaki, Guillermo Sanmarco &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{C}:=\mathcal{C}(G,\omega,H,\psi)$ be a finite group scheme-theoretical category over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p\ge 0$ as defined by the first author. For any indecomposable exact module category over $\mathcal{C}$, we classify its simple objects and provide an expression for their projective covers in terms of double cosets and projective representations of certain closed subgroup schemes of $G$. This upgrades a result of Ostrik for group-theoretical fusion categories in characteristic $0$, and generalizes our previous work for the case $\omega=1$. As a byproduct, we describe the simples and indecomposable projectives of $\mathcal{C}$. Finally, we apply our results to describe the blocks of the center of ${\rm Coh}(G,\omega)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using Mackey functors, we provide a general framework for classifying torsors of algebraic tori in terms of Brauer groups of finite field extensions of the base field. This generalizes Blunk's description of the tori associated to del Pezzo surfaces of degree 6 to all retract rational tori, essentially the largest class for which this is possible.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06188v2'>2305.06188</a>\]&nbsp; **On the third and fourth Betti numbers of a homogeneous space of a Lie group**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Indranil Biswas, Pralay Chatterjee, Chandan Maity &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the paper "The second cohomology of nilpotent orbits in classical Lie algebras, Kyoto J. Math. 60 (2020), no. 2, 717-799" by I. Biswas, P. Chatterjee, and C. Maity, explicit descriptions of the second and first real de Rham cohomology groups of a general homogeneous space of a Lie group are given, extending an earlier result in "On the exactness of Kostant-Kirillov form and the second cohomology of nilpotent orbits, Internat. J. Math. 23 (2012), no. 8, 1250086" by I. Biswas and P. Chatterjee. From the computational viewpoint, they turned out to be new and very useful, and in fact played a crucial role in determining the second cohomology of nilpotent orbits as done in the above two papers. In this paper, we give computable and explicit descriptions of the third and fourth real de Rham cohomologies of a general homogeneous space, in terms of the associated Lie-theoretic data, along the lines mentioned above. We also draw numerous corollaries of our main results in important special settings. Moreover, as a consequence, we obtain a new and interesting invariant by showing that for a large class of homogeneous spaces, the difference between the third and fourth Betti numbers coincides with the difference between the numbers of simple factors of the ambient group and the associated closed subgroup.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 68 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is the first paper in a series on intrinsic Donaldson-Thomas theory, where we develop a new framework for enumerative geometry that allows the generalization of constructions and results from linear moduli stacks to general non-linear algebraic stacks. In this paper, we introduce the component lattice of an algebraic stack. This is a key object in our theory, defined using the formalism of stacks of graded and filtered points. It provides the combinatorial data needed to formulate various results in enumerative geometry, such as decomposition-type theorems and wall-crossing formulae. Later papers in the series will focus on extending Donaldson-Thomas theory to the non-linear case, and we expect that our approach will be useful for extending many other flavours of enumerative invariants beyond the linear case as well. This paper proves several foundational results of our framework. The first is the constancy theorem, which states that the isomorphism types of connected components of the stacks of graded and filtered points stay constant within chambers in the component lattice. The second is the finiteness theorem, which provides a criterion for the finiteness of the number of possible isomorphism types of these components. The third is the associativity theorem, generalizing the structure of Hall algebras from linear stacks to general stacks. We also discuss some applications of these results outside Donaldson-Thomas theory, including a construction of stacks of real-weighted filtrations, and a generalization of the semistable reduction theorem to real-weighted filtrations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study functions introduced by Knopp and complete them to non-holomorphic bimodular forms of positive integral weight related to indefinite binary quadratic forms. We investigate further properties of our completions, which in turn motivates certain local cusp forms. We then define modular analogues of negative weight of our local cusp forms, which are locally harmonic Maass forms with continuously removable singularities. We show that they admit local splittings in terms of Eichler integrals.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A repdigit is a positive integer that has only one distinct digit in its decimal expansion, i.e., a number has the form $d(10^m-1)/9$ for some $m\geq 1$ and $1 \leq d \leq 9$. Let $\left(T_n\right)_{n\ge0}$ be the sequence of Tribonacci. This paper deals with the presence of repdigits in the products of consecutive shifted Tribonacci numbers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This is the (lightly) revised final version; to appear in Groups, Geometry, and Dynamics

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by questions arising from billiard trajectories in the regular $n$-gon, McMullen defined a pair of functions $\kappa$ and $\delta$ on the cusps $c$ of the corresponding triangle group $\Delta_n$ inside $\mathrm{SL}_2({\mathcal{O}})$, where ${\mathcal{O}} = \mathbf{Z}[\zeta_n+ \zeta^{-1}_n]$. McMullen asks for which $n$ these functions are congruence, that is, when they only depend on the image of the cusp $c \in \mathbf{P}^1(\mathcal{O})$ in $\mathbf{P}^1(\mathcal{O}/d)$ for some integer $d$. In this note, we answer McMullen's questions. We obtain our results by computing the exact closure of $\Delta_n \subset \mathrm{SL}_2({\mathcal{O}})$ inside $\mathrm{SL}_2(\widehat{{\mathcal{O}}})$, where $\widehat{{\mathcal{O}}}$ is the profinite completion of ${\mathcal{O}}$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ken Ono &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The parity of the partition function $p(n)$ remains strikingly mysterious. Beyond a handful of fragmentary results, essentially nothing is known about the distribution of parity. We prove a uniform result on quadratic progressions. If $1<D\equiv 23\pmod{24}$ is square-free and only divisible by primes $\ell\equiv 1, 7\pmod 8$, then both parities occur infinitely often among $$ p\left(\frac{Dm^2+1}{24}\right), $$ with $(m,6)=1.$ The argument takes place on the modular curve $X_0(6)$ and shows that parity along these thin orbits is \emph{not constant}. The proof connects classical identities for the partition generating function, through the method of (twisted) Borcherds products, to the arithmetic geometry of {\it ordinary} CM fibers on the Deligne-Rapoport model of $X_0(6)$ in characteristic 2. This result is a special case of a general theorem for the coefficients of suitable vector-valued weight 1/2 harmonic Maass forms that satisfy a "Heegner packet'' condition.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the existence of a Genus-Type Theory that generalizes classical genus theory by linking fractional ideals of number fields to structures built from their Galois groups and associated Diophantine equations, as formally stated in Theorem 30 and Remark 7.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Debmalya Basak, Dorian Goldfeld, Nicolas Robles, Alexandru Zaharescu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Minor changes

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $D\equiv 1\bmod{4}$ be a fundamental discriminant of a real quadratic field. We construct an analogue of the classical Dedekind eta function for the Hecke group $H(\sqrt{D})$. This gives rise to a family of holomorphic modular functions for $H(\sqrt{D})$ which vanish at the cusp at $\infty$ and were not known previously. We establish results and propose some conjectures regarding the behavior of the Fourier coefficients associated to these modular forms.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 1+16 pages, 1 figure, 1 table, Contribution in Proceedings of XXV International Workshop-School High Energy Physics and Quantum Field Theory (QFTHEP'270), Moscow, 30 June- 5 July, 2025

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We extend the results of Lagrangian formulations study to construct gauge-invariant Lagrangians for (ir)reducible integer higher-spin massless and massive representations of the Poincare group with a Young tableau $Y[\hat{s}_1,\hat{s}_2,\hat{s}_3]$ in $d$-dimensional flat space-time (as the probable candidates to describe the Dark Matter problem beyond the SM). These particles are described within a metric-like formulation by tensor fields with 3 groups of antisymmetric Lorentz indices $\Phi_{\mu^1[{\hat{s}_1}],\mu^2[{\hat{s}_2}], \mu^3[{\hat{s}_3}]}$ on a basis of the BRST method with complete, $Q$, and incomplete, $Q_c$, BRST operators. We found unconstrained (with $Q$) and constrained (with $Q_c$ and off-shell BRST invariant holonomic constraints) gauge Lagrangian formulations with different configuration spaces and reducibility stages. The deformation procedure to construct interacting gauge model with mixed-antisymmetric fields is proposed.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 46 pages; some minor corrections and added references

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish the limiting distribution of $\frac{{(\log \log x)}^{1/4}}{\sqrt{x}} \sum_{n\le x}\alpha(n)$ where $\alpha$ is a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, answering a question of Harper. The distributional convergence is proved by applying the martingale central limit theorem to a suitably truncated sum. This truncation is inspired by work of Najnudel, Paquette, Simm and Vu on subcritical holomorphic multiplicative chaos setting, but analysed with a different conditioning argument generalised from Harper's work on fractional moments to circumvent integrability issues at criticality. A significant part of the proof is devoted to the convergence in probability of the associated partial Euler product to a critical multiplicative chaos measure, independent of the mild shift away from the critical line. Our approach to the universality of critical non-Gaussian multiplicative chaos bypasses the barrier analysis with the help of a modified second moment method, and employs a novel argument based on coupling and homogenisation by change of measure, which could be of independent interest.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Khai-Hoan Nguyen-Dang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 17p, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix $n\ge3$. For the pure field $K_a=\Bbb Q(\theta)$, $\theta^n=a$ with $a$ $n$th-power-free, we encode an integral basis in the fixed coordinate $\{1,\theta,\dots,\theta^{n-1}\}$ by its \emph{shape}. We prove a sharp local-to-global principle: for each $p^e\!\parallel n$, the local shape at $p$ is determined by $a\bmod p^{\,e+1}$, and this precision is optimal. Moreover, the global shape is periodic with minimal modulus $$ M(n)=\prod_{p^e\parallel n}p^{\,e+1}=n\cdot\mathrm{rad}(n), $$ providing many applications in the understanding integral bases of pure number fields.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages. Constructive comments are always welcome. We sincerely thank Professor Ulrich Thiel, an expert in the OSCAR computer algebra system, for the very interesting and useful professional discussions and exchanges. Through these exchanges, we had the opportunity to approach the OSCAR computer algebra system and develop more efficient computational programs

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the field of characteristic two, $\mathbb F_2.$ Denote by $GL(q)$ the general linear group of rank $q$ over $\mathbb F_2.$ The algebraic transfer, introduced by W. Singer [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523], is a rather effective tool for unraveling the intricate structure of the (mod-2) cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr A}^{q,*}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2).$ The Kameko homomorphism is one of the useful tools to study the dimension of the domain of the Singer transfer. Singer conjectured that the algebraic transfer is always a monomorphism, but this remains open for all homology degrees $q\geq 5.$ In this paper, by constructing a novel algorithm implemented in the computer algebra system OSCAR for computing $GL(q)$-invariants of the kernel of the Kameko homomorphism, we disprove Singer's conjecture for bidegree $(6, 6+36).$</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-09-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hazem Hassan &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Heegner cycles are higher weight analogues of Heegner points. Their arithmetic intersection numbers also appear as Fourier coefficients of modular forms and often belong to abelian extensions of imaginary-quadratic fields. Rotger and Seveso propose a precise recipe for the $p$-adic Abel-Jacobi images of cycle classes whose existence is predicted by conjectures of Bloch and Beilinson and which would be a real-quadratic analogue to Heegner cycles: the Stark-Heegner cycles of the title. In this paper, we generalize Darmon-Vonk's theory of rigid meromorphic cocycles to higher weight, producing a higher Green's pairing of real-quadratic divisors on the $p$-adic upper half-plane, which seems to be the real-quadratic analogue of the pairing of Heegner cycles. Computation of these values for "principal cycles'' gives evidence that they lie in abelian extensions of real-quadratic fields. The algebraicity of certain values of the higher Green's function is indirect evidence for the existence of algebraic Stark-Heegner cycles.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 44 pages; some minor corrections

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\alpha$ be a Steinhaus random multiplicative function. For a wide class of multiplicative functions $f$ we construct a multiplicative chaos measure arising from the Dirichlet series of $\alpha f$, in the whole $L^1$-regime. Our method does not rely on the thick point approach or Gaussian approximation, and uses a modified second moment method with the help of an approximate Girsanov theorem. We also employ the idea of weak convergence in $L^r$ to show that the limiting measure is independent of the choice of the approximation schemes, and this may be seen as a non-Gaussian analogue of Shamov's characterisation of multiplicative chaos. Our class of $f$-s consists of those for which the mean value of $|f(p)|^2$ lies in $(0,1)$. In particular, it includes the indicator of sums of two squares. As an application of our construction, we establish a generalised central limit theorem for the (normalised) sums of $\alpha f$, with random variance determined by the total mass of our measure.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 35 pages, part II of a series of 4 articles, minor corrections to v1

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This series of papers is a contribution to the program of classifying $p$-blocks of finite groups up to source algebra equivalence, starting with the case of cyclic blocks. To any $p$-block $\mathbf{B}$ of a finite group with cyclic defect group $D$, Linckelmann associated an invariant $W( \mathbf{B} )$, which is an indecomposable endo-permutation module over $D$, and which, together with the Brauer tree of $\mathbf{B}$, essentially determines its source algebra equivalence class. In Parts II-IV of our series of papers, we classify, for odd $p$, those endo-permutation modules of cyclic $p$-groups arising from $p$-blocks of quasisimple groups. In the present Part II, we reduce the desired classification for the quasisimple classical groups of Lie type $B$, $C$, and $D$ to the corresponding objective for the general linear and unitary groups; the classification is completed for the latter groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Abel's problem consists in identifying the conditions under which the diferential equation $y'=\eta y$, with $\eta$ an algebraic function in $\mathbb{C}(x)$, possesses a non-zero algebraic solution $y$. This problem has been algorithmically solved by Risch. In a previous paper, we have presented an alternative solution in the special arithmetic situation where $\eta$ has a Puiseux expansion with $\textit{rational}$ coefficients at the origin: there exists a non-trivial algebraic solution of $y'=\eta y$ if and only if the coefficients of the Puiseux expansion of $x\eta(x)$ at $0$ satisfy Gauss congruences for almost all prime numbers. In this paper, we generalize this criterion to arbitrary $\eta$ algebraic over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}(x)$, by means of a natural generalization to number fields of Gauss congruences and of the weaker Cartier congruences recently introduced in this context by Bostan. We then provide applications of this criterion in the hypergeometric setting and for Artin-Mazur zeta functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We systematically apply semisimplification functors in modular representation theory. Motivated by the Duflo--Serganova functor in Lie superalgebras, we construct various functors of interest. In the setting of finite groups, we refine the cyclic group Brauer construction and categorify the Glauberman correspondence. In the setting of degenerate categorical Heisenberg actions, we obtain a rich collection of functors which commute with the categorical action. Applied to well-known categorifications of the basic representation and Fock space, our functors give explicit realizations of periodic equivalences for polynomial functors and symmetric groups first studied by Henke-Koenig. This allows us to globalize the equivalences of Henke-Koenig by symmetric monoidal functors. We apply these results to deduce branching properties of certain modular representations of $S_n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of a Young generating function for a probability measure on integer partitions. We use this object to characterize probability distributions over integer partitions satisfying a law of large numbers and those that satisfy a central limit theorem. We further establish a multilevel central limit theorem, which enables the study of random standard Young tableaux. As applications of these results, we describe the fluctuations of height functions associated with (i) the Plancherel growth process, (ii) random standard Young tableaux of fixed shape, and (iii) probability distributions induced by extreme characters of the infinite symmetric group $S_\infty$. In all cases, we identify the limiting fluctuations as a conditioned Gaussian Free Field.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Our goal in this paper is to construct optimal topological generators for compact unitary Lie groups, extending the work of a letter of Sarnak and arXiv:1704.02106 on golden and super-golden gates to higher dimensions. To do so we consider a variant of the Sarnak--Xue Density Hypotheses in the weight aspect for definite projective unitary groups and prove it using the endoscopic classification of automorphic representations. Our main motivation is to construct efficient multi-qubit universal gate sets for quantum computers. For example, we find a set of universal gates that, for a given accuracy, can heuristically approximate arbitrary unitary operations on 2 qubits with $\approx$10 times fewer ``expensive'' $T$-type gates than the standard Clifford+$T$ set. Our framework also covers the 2-qubit Clifford+CS gate set, well-known for being particularly friendly to fault-tolerant implementation. We thereby prove tight upper bounds on the required CS count for approximations (specifically, $4.8$x fewer non-Clifford gates than Clifford+$T$).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The representation theory of tensor functions is essential to constitutive modeling of materials including both mechanical and physical behaviors. Generally, material symmetry is incorporated in the tensor functions through a structural or anisotropic tensor that characterizes the corresponding point group. The general mathematical framework was well-established in the 1990s. Nevertheless, the traditional theory suffers from a grand challenge that many point groups involve fourth or sixth order structural tensors that hinder its practical applications in engineering. Recently, researchers have reformulated the representation theory and opened up opportunities to model anisotropic materials using low-order (i.e., 2nd-order and lower) structural tensors only, although the theory was not fully established. This work aims to fully establish the reformulated representation theory of tensor functions for all two-dimensional point groups. It was found that each point group needs a structural tensor set to characterize the symmetry. For each two-dimensional point group, the structural tensor set is proposed and the general tensor functions are derived. Only low-order structural tensors are introduced so researchers can readily apply these tensor functions for their modeling applications. The theory presented here is useful for constitutive modeling of materials in general, especially for composites, nanomaterials, soft tissues, etc.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the homological properties of Schur algebras $S(p, 2p)$ over a field $k$ of positive characteristic $p$, focusing on their interplay with the representation theory of quotients of group algebras of symmetric groups via Schur-Weyl duality. Schur-Weyl duality establishes that the centraliser algebra, $\Lambda(p, 2p)$, of the tensor space $(k^p)^{\otimes 2p}$ (as a module over $S(p, 2p)$) is a quotient of the group algebra of the symmetric group. In this paper, we prove that Schur-Weyl duality between $S(p, 2p)$ and $\Lambda(p, 2p)$ is an instance of an Auslander-type correspondence. We compute the global dimension of Schur algebras $S(p, 2p)$ and their relative dominant dimension with respect to the tensor space $(k^p)^{\otimes 2p}$. In particular, we show that the pair $(S(p, 2p), (k^p)^{\otimes 2p})$ forms a relative $4(p-1)$-Auslander pair in the sense of Cruz and Psaroudakis, thereby connecting Schur algebras with higher homological algebra. Moreover, we determine the Hemmer-Nakano dimension associated with the quasi-hereditary cover of $\Lambda(p, 2p)$ that arises from Schur-Weyl duality. As an application, we show that the direct sum of some Young modules over $\Lambda(p, 2p)$ is a full tilting module when $p>2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It has been known since 1992 that the McKay-Thompson series $T_g(q)$ of the Moonshine module form Hauptmoduln for genus zero subgroups of $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$. In 2021, Lin and Shao constructed a series analogous to the McKay-Thompson series (a twined partition function of the Monster CFT), but using a non-invertible topological defect rather than an element of the Monster group $\mathcal{M}$. This "defect McKay-Thompson series" was found to be invariant under a genus zero subgroup of $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$, but was shown not to be the Hauptmodul of the subgroup. Nevertheless, one might wonder if a weaker version of Borcherds' theorem holds for non-invertible defects: perhaps defect McKay-Thompson series enjoy genus zero invariance groups in $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$, whether or not they are Hauptmoduln for those groups. Using the decompositions of the monster stress tensor found in Bae et al. (2021), we construct several new defect McKay-Thompson series, study their modular properties, and determine their invariance groups in $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$. We discover that many of the invariance groups are not genus zero.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We identify a close relationship between stable sheaf cohomology for polynomial functors applied to the cotangent bundle on projective space, and Koszul--Ringel duality on the category of strict polynomial functors as described in the work of Cha\l upnik, Krause, and Touz\'e. Combining this with recent results of Maliakas--Stergiopoulou we confirm a conjectured periodicity statement for stable cohomology. In a different direction, we find a remarkable invariance property for $\Ext$ groups between Schur functors associated to hook partitions, and compute all such extension groups over a field of arbitrary characteristic. We show that this is further equivalent to the calculation of $\Ext$ groups for partitions with $2$ rows (or $2$ columns), and as such it relates to Parker's recursive description of $\Ext$ groups for $\SL_2$-representations. Finally, we give a general sharp bound for the interval of degrees where stable cohomology of a Schur functor can be non-zero.</p></details>

We show that under the assumption of an exceptional character $\chi$ with $L(1,\chi)=o\left((\log D)^{-5}\right)$, for any $q<x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$, the asymptotic $$\psi(x,q,a)=\frac{\psi(x)}{\phi(q)}\left(1-\chi\left(\frac{aD}{(D,q)}\right)+o(1)\right)$$ holds for almost all $a$ with $(a,q)=1$. We also find that for any fixed $a$, the above holds for almost all $q<x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$ with $(a,q)=1$. Previous prime equidistribution results under the assumption of Siegel zeroes (by Friedlander-Iwaniec and the current author) have found that the above asymptotic holds either for all $a$ and $q$ or on average over a range of $q$ (i.e. for the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture), but only under the assumption that $q<x^{\theta}$ where $\theta=\frac{30}{59}$ or $\frac{16}{31}$, respectively.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In previous work we computed the number $C_n(q)$ of ideals of codimension $n$ of the algebra ${\mathbb{F}}_q[x,y,x^{-1}, y^{-1}]$ of two-variable Laurent polynomials over a finite field: it turned out that $C_n(q)$ is a palindromic polynomial of degree $2n$ in $q$, divisible by $(q-1)^2$. The quotient $P_n(q) = C_n(q)/(q-1)^2$ is a palindromic polynomial of degree $2n-2$. For each $n\geq 1$ let ${\overline{P}}_n(X) \in {\mathbb{Z}}[X]$ be the degree $n-1$ polynomial such that ${\overline{P}}_n(q+q^{-1}) = P_n(q)/q^{n-1}$. In this note we show that for any integer $N$ the integer value ${\overline{P}}_n(N)$ is close to the value at $N$ of the degree $n-1$ polynomial $F_{n-1}(X) = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \, {\overline{T}}_k(X)$, which is a sum of monic versions ${\overline{T}}_k(X)$ of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. We give a precise formula for ${\overline{P}}_n(X)$ as a linear combination of $F_k(X)$'s, each appearance of the latter being parametrized by an odd divisor of $n$. As a consequence, ${\overline{P}}_n(X) = F_{n-1}(X)$ if and only if $n$ is a power of $2$. We exhibit similar formulas for $C_n(q)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $S$ be a smooth irreducible curve defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian scheme over $S$ and $\mathcal{C}$ a curve inside $\mathcal{A}$, both defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. In this paper we prove that the set of points in which $\mathcal{C}$ intersects proper flat subgroup schemes of $\mathcal{A}$ tangentially is finite. The crucial case of elliptic curves already follows from a result by Corvaja, Demeio, Masser and Zannier: in this case we provide an alternative proof using the Pila-Zannier method. Such a proof may lead to an effective result using an effective point-counting theorem. This fits in the framework of the so-called problems of unlikely intersections, and can be seen as a variation of the relative Pink conjecture for abelian varieties.</p></details>

We also utilize the Bernstein-Zelevinsky theory to establish two additional results: the Leibniz law for the highest derivative and a unitarity criterion for general linear groups.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Schanuel Conjecture contains all ``reasonable" statements that can be made on the values of the exponential function. In particular it implies the Lindemann-Weierstrass Theorem. In my Ph.D. I showed that Schanuel Conjecture has a geometrical origin: it is equivalent to the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture applied to a 1-motive without abelian part. In this paper, we state a conjecture in Schanuel style, which will imply conjectures in Lindemann-Weierstrass style, for the semi-elliptic exponential function, that is for the exponential map of an extension G of an elliptic curve E by a multiplicative group. We propose the semi-elliptic Conjecture, which concerns the exponential function, the Weierstrass $\wp,$ $\zeta$ functions and Serre functions. The case of a trivial extension has been treated in \cite{BW}, where we introduced the split semi-elliptic Conjecture. As in Schanuel's case, we expect that the semi-elliptic Conjecture contains all ``reasonable" statements that can be made on the values of the exponential function, of the Weierstrass $\wp$, $\zeta$ functions and of Serre functions. We show that the semi-elliptic Conjecture has a geometrical origin (as Schanuel Conjecture): it is equivalent to the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture applied to a 1-motive whose underlying abelian part is an elliptic curve. We prove the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture for 1-motives defined by an elliptic curve with algebraic invariants and complex multiplication and by torsion points. We introduce the $\sigma$-Conjecture which involves the Weierstrass $\wp$, $\zeta$ and $\sigma$ functions and we show that this conjecture is a consequence of the Grothendieck-Andr\'e periods Conjecture applied to an adequate 1-motive.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a series of papers we investigated the following question: given a family $\calF$ of binary forms having nonzero discriminant and integer coefficients, for each $d\geqslant 3$, we estimate the number of integers $m$ with $|m|\leqslant N$ which are represented by an element in $\calF$ of degree $\geqslant d$. Under suitable assumptions, asymptotically as $N\to\infty$, the main term in the estimate is given by the forms in $\calF$ having degree $d$ (if any), while the forms of degree $>d$ contribute only to the error term. The present text is devoted to fewnomials $$ a_0X^{kr}+a_1X^{k(r-1)}Y^k+\cdots +a_{r-1}X^kY^{k(r-1)}+a_rY^{kr} $$ with fixed $r\geqslant 1$ and varying $k,a_0,a_1,\dots,a_r$.</p></details>

Then, we present deterministic polynomial time algorithms to perform the orthogonalization process, solve the LVP and solve the CVP with an orthogonal basis of the whole vector space. Finally, we conclude that orthogonalization and the CVP are polynomially equivalent.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 36 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a rigid object $M$ in an algebraic triangulated category $\mathcal{T}$, a functor pr$(M)\to\mathcal{H}^{[-1,0]}({\rm proj}\, A)$ is constructed, which essentially takes an object to its `presentation', where pr$(M)$ is the full subcategory of $\mathcal{T}$ of objects finitely presented by $M$, $A$ is the endomorphism algebra of $M$ and $\mathcal{H}^{[-1,0]}({\rm proj}\, A)$ is the homotopy category of complexes of finitely projective $A$-modules concentrated in degrees $-1$ and $0$. This functor is shown to be full and dense and its kernel is described. It detects isomorphisms, indecomposability and extriangles. In the Hom-finite case, it induces a bijection from the set of isomorphism classes of basic relative cluster-tilting objects of pr$(M)$ to that of basic silting complexs of $\mathcal{H}^{[-1,0]}({\rm proj}\, A)$, which commutes with mutations. These results are applied to cluster categories of self-injective quivers with potential to recover a theorem of Mizuno on the endomorphism algebras of certain 2-term silting complexes. As an interesting consequence of the main results, if $\mathcal{T}$ is a 2-Calabi--Yau triangulated category and $M$ is a cluster-tilting object such that $A$ is self-injective, then $\mathbb{P}$ is an equivalence, in particular, $\mathcal{H}^{[-1,0]}({\rm proj}\, A)$ admits a triangle structure. In the appendix by Iyama it is shown that for a finite-dimensional algebra $A$, if $\mathcal{H}^{[-1,0]}({\rm proj}\, A)$ admits a triangle structure, then $A$ is necessarily self-injective.</p></details>

Very recently, by applying Hilbert's theorem, we proved that a $2 \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of three squares of bilinear forms. This improved Calder\'{o}n's result for $m=2$, and left the sos (sum-of-squares) rank problem of $m \times 2$ biquadratic forms for $m \ge 3$ to further exploration. In this paper, we show that a $3 \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as four squares of bilinear forms.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The $p^\infty$-fine Selmer group of an elliptic curve $E$ over a number field $F$ is a subgroup of the classical $p^\infty$-Selmer group of $E$ over $F$. Fine Selmer group is closely related to the 1st and 2nd Iwasawa cohomology groups. Coates-Sujatha observed that the structure of the fine Selmer group of $E$ over a $p$-adic Lie extension of a number field is intricately related to some deep questions in classical Iwasawa theory; for example, Iwasawa's classical $\mu$-invariant vanishing conjecture. In this article, we study the properties of the $p^\infty$-fine Selmer group of an elliptic curve over certain $p$-adic Lie extensions of a number field. We also define and discuss $p^\infty$-fine Selmer group of an elliptic curve over function fields of characteristic $p$ and also of characteristic $\ell \neq p.$ We relate our study with a conjecture of Jannsen.</p></details>

More precisely, we show that the inclusion of the Witt vectors into the Lubin-Tate ring induces a split injection on continuous stabilizer cohomology with torsion cokernel of bounded exponent, thereby proving Hopkins' chromatic splitting conjecture and the vanishing conjecture of Beaudry-Goerss-Henn rationally. The key ingredients are the equivalence between the Lubin-Tate tower and the Drinfeld tower due to Faltings and Scholze-Weinstein, integral $p$-adic Hodge theory, and an integral refinement of a theorem of Tate on the Galois cohomology of non-archimedean fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Two pertinent questions for any support theory of a monoidal triangulated category are whether it is functorial and if the tensor product property holds. To this end, we consider the complete prime spectrum of an essentially small monoidal triangulated category, which we show is universal among support data satisfying the tensor product property, even if it is empty. The complete prime spectrum is functorial and parametrizes radical thick tensor-ideals, a noncommutative analogue of Balmer's reconstruction theorem. We give criteria for when induced maps on complete prime spectra are injective or surjective, and determine the complete prime spectrum for crossed product categories. Finally, we determine the universal functorial support theory for monoidal triangulated categories coinciding with the Balmer spectrum on braided monoidal triangulated categories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The generalized diamond group is the semi-direct product $G$ of the abelian group ${\mathbb R}^m$ by the $(2n+1)$-dimensional Heisenberg group $H_n$. We construct the generic representations of $G$ on the Fock space by extending those of $H_n$. Then we study the Berezin correspondence and the complex Weyl correspondence in connection with a generic representation $\pi$ of $G$, proving in particular that these correspondences are covariant with respect to $\pi$. We give also some explicit formulas for the Berezin symbols and the complex Weyl symbols of the representation operators $\pi(g)$ for $g\in G$. These results are applied to recover various formulas involving the Moyal product. Moreover, we relate $\pi$ to a coadjoint orbit of $G$ in the spirit of the Kirillov-Kostant method of orbits. This allows us to establish that the complex Weyl correspondence is a Stratonovich-Weyl correspondence for $\pi$.</p></details>

This structure is then related to canonical quartic Poisson/Batalin-Vilkovisky structures on suitable representation varieties of the quiver. Constructions on the representation side take place in symmetric monoidal $\Pi$-categories, which prompts a discussion of graded differential operators on commutative monoids in any such category. The generality of the categorical approach allows us to fully recover necklace structures, showing how the modified and classical necklace operations are related via dualisability.</p></details>

It is also seen to provide an explanation for the fact that the expansion on the basis $J_{n,k}^{(a,b,c)}(x,y)$ of the polynomials obtained from the latter by permuting the variables $x,y, z=1-x-y$ and the parameters $(a,b,c)$ is given in terms of Racah polynomials.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Functions satisfying the functional equation \begin{align*} \sum_{r=0}^{n-1} (-1)^r f(x+ry, ny) = f(x,y), \quad \text{for any positive odd integer $n$}, \end{align*} are named the alternating invariant functions. Examples of such functions include Euler polynomials, alternating Hurwitz zeta functions and their associated Gamma functions. In this paper, we systematically investigate the fundamental properties of alternating invariant functions. We prove that the set of such functions is closed under translation, reflection, and differentiation. In addition, we define a convolution operation on alternating invariant functions and derive explicit convolution formulas for Euler polynomials and alternating Hurwitz zeta functions, respectively. Furthermore, using distributional relations, we construct new examples of alternating invariant functions, including suitable combinations of trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, among others.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages, final accepted version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we prove several transfer principles for the cohomological dimension of fields. Given a fixed field $K$ with finite cohomological dimension $\delta$, the two main ones allow to: - construct totally ramified extensions of $K$ with cohomological dimension $\leq \delta - 1$ when $K$ is a complete discrete valuation field; - construct algebraic extensions of $K$ with cohomological dimension $\leq \delta-1$ and satisfying a norm condition. We then apply these results to Serre's conjecture II and to some variants for fields of any cohomological dimension that are inspired by conjectures of Kato and Kuzumaki. In particular, we prove that Serre's conjecture II for characteristic $0$ fields implies Serre's conjecture II for positive characteristic fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We conjecture the full asymptotic expansion of a product of Riemann zeta functions, evaluated at the non-trivial zeros of the zeta function, with shifts added in each argument. By taking derivatives with respect to these shifts, we form a conjecture for the integer moments of mixed derivatives of the zeta function. This generalises a result of the authors where they took complex moments of the first derivative of the zeta function, evaluated at the non-trivial zeros. We approach this problem in two different ways: the first uses a random matrix theory approach, and the second by the Ratios Conjecture of Conrey, Farmer, and Zirnbauer.</p></details>

> **Comment:** A few typos corrected

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve and $p \geq 3$ a prime. The modular curve $X_E^-(p)$ parametrizes elliptic curves with $p$-torsion modules anti-symplectically isomorphic to $E[p]$. For each $\ell \neq p$, we give conditions, in terms of the type of reduction of $E$ at $\ell$ and standard invariants associated to $E/\mathbb{Q}_\ell$, for $X_E^-(p)(\mathbb{Q}_\ell)$ to be non-empty. Moreover, our conditions completely classify when $X_E^-(p)(\mathbb{Q}_\ell) \neq \emptyset$ except in a special case of good reduction; our main result includes $\ell = p$ when $E$ is semistable at $p$. As an application, we classify CM curves $E/\mathbb{Q}$ where the modular curve $X_E^-(p)$ is a counterexample to the Hasse principle for infinitely many $p$. Assuming the Frey--Mazur conjecture, we prove that for at least $60\%$ of rational elliptic curves $E$, the modular curve $X_E^-(p)$ is a counterexample to the Hasse principle for at least $50\%$ of primes $p$. Additionally, we simplify several local symplectic criteria in the work of the first author and Alain Kraus.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider unitary Shimura varieties at places where the totally real field ramifies over $\mbQ$. Our first result constructs comparison isomorphisms between absolute and relative local models in this context, which relies on a reformulation of the Eisenstein condition of Rapoport--Zink and Rapoport--Smithling--Zhang. Related to that, we also provide a moduli description for the integral models of RSZ unitary Shimura varieties in new cases. Our second result lifts the comparison of local models to categories of $p$-divisible groups and, as a corollary, to various kinds of Rapoport--Zink spaces. Our third result is a proof of the arithmetic transfer conjecture of the third author in full generality. Using our statements about Rapoport--Zink spaces, we extend the previous proof from the unramified case to that of all $p$-adic local fields ($p$ odd).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a functorial approach to the study of $n$-abelian categories by reformulating their axioms in terms of their categories of finitely presented functors. Such an approach allows the use of classical homological algebra and representation theory techniques to understand higher homological algebra. As an application, we present two possible generalizations of the axioms "every monomorphism is a kernel" and "every epimorphism is a cokernel" of an abelian category to $n$-abelian categories. We also specialize our results to modules over rings, thereby describing when the category of finitely generated projective modules over a ring is $n$-abelian. Moreover, we establish a correspondence for $n$-abelian categories with additive generators, which extends the higher Auslander correspondence.</p></details>

> **Comment:** The paper's logical architecture has been fundamentally restructured to resolve analytical gaps from the previous version. Ch. 5 is completely rewritten to provide a rigorous proof of absolute convergence by properly addressing the kernel's singularities from the outset. Proofs of key properties like smoothness are now explicitly deferred to future work

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper constructs a weight-shifting integral operator, U_{k,t}, that maps the space of weight-k Maass forms to the space of weight-t functions for the full modular group SL(2,Z). The operator is defined via an integral transform whose kernel is the product of a covariant factor and a modular invariant function, F. The central hypothesis is that the kernel itself must be an eigenfunction of the weight-t hyperbolic Laplacian. We show this spectral condition reduces the determination of F to a Papperitz-Riemann equation, which is then transformed into the standard Gauss Hypergeometric Differential Equation. We provide an explicit determination of the hypergeometric parameters in terms of the initial automorphic data and rigorously establish the operator's region of absolute convergence. The automorphy of the transformed function is proven. In contrast, other key properties such as smoothness and the intertwining condition are supported by conditional arguments that rely on analytical assumptions deferred to future work. Finally, the emergence of the hypergeometric structure suggests a potential connection to the theory of hypergeometric motives, a perspective illustrated by the recovery of the periods of the Legendre family of elliptic curves in a specific case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb V$ be an $\mathbb N$-graded, $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra (VOA) admitting a non-lowest generated module in $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)$ (e.g., the triplet algebras $\mathcal{W}_p$ for $p\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$ or the even symplectic fermion VOAs $SF_d^+$ for $d\in \mathbb{Z}_+$). We prove that, unlike in the rational case, the spaces of conformal blocks associated to certain $\mathbb V$-modules do not form a vector bundle on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,N}$ for $N\geq 4$ by showing that their dimensions differ between nodal and smooth curves. Consequently, the sheaf of coinvariants associated to these $\mathbb V$-modules on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,N}$ is not locally free for $N\geq 4$. It also follows that, unlike in the rational case, the mode transition algebra $\mathfrak A$ introduced by Damiolini-Gibney-Krashen is not isomorphic to the end $\mathbb E=\int_{\mathbb X\in \mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb X)}\mathbb X\otimes \mathbb{X}'$ as an object of $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes 2})$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** In the present version, we establish a strong prime-field analogue of a question of Mattila on intersection patterns and prove the rotational Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance problem

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ and $B$ be sets in a finite vector space. In this paper, we study the magnitude of the set $A\cap f(B)$, where $f$ runs through a set of transformations. More precisely, we will focus on the cases that the set of transformations is given by orthogonal matrices or orthogonal projections. One of the most important contributions of this paper is to show that if $A, B\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ satisfy some natural conditions, then, for almost every $g\in O(d)$, there are at least $\gg q^d$ elements $z\in \mathbb{F}_q^d$ such that $$|A\cap (g(B)+z)| \sim \frac{|A||B|}{q^d}.$$ This implies that $|A-gB|\gg q^d$ for almost every $g\in O(d)$. In the flavor of expanding functions, with $|A|\le |B|$, we also show that the image $A-gB$ grows exponentially. In two dimensions, the result simply says that if $|A|=q^x$ and $|B|=q^y$, as long as $0<x\le y<2$, then for almost every $g\in O(2)$, we can always find $\epsilon=\epsilon(x, y)>0$ such that $|A-gB|\gg |B|^{1+\epsilon}$. To prove these results, we need to develop new and robust incidence bounds between points and rigid motions by using a number of techniques including algebraic methods and discrete Fourier analysis. Our results are essentially sharp in odd dimensions. In the prime field plane, we further employ recent $L^2$ distance bounds and point-line/plane incidence machinery to derive improvements. Notable applications include a strong prime field analogue of a question of Mattila related to the Falconer distance problem, the Rotational Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance problem, and a quadratic expansion law. Taken together, the results in this paper present a robust two-way link between intersection phenomena and distance problems over finite fields, with dimension-uniform consequences and sharpness in several ranges.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that $\mathsf{OT}_\eta(T)\ll T\log^2 T$ unconditionally via a band-limited test scheme with Fej\'er averaging. The approach normalizes $\|\widehat f\|_1=\Theta(T^{-1})$ to ensure $\|h\|_1\asymp T$ and $\|\widehat h\|_1\ll 1$, and applies an $L^1$-controlled smoothed explicit formula to bound the error terms. As a result, the prime--zero optimal transport distance admits the baseline $T\log^2 T$ upper bound without additional assumptions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Modular resolutions help us to understand the structure of modules over rings with positive characteristic. In this paper, we introduce a new technique based on Wildberger's polyseries expansions to construct and analyse such resolutions

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the modular resolution method using a new tool called a polyserie, introduced by Wildberger N.J. \& Rubine D. in their recent article \cite{wildberger2025hyper}. In the present article we try to prove an equivalence theorem of the existence and the uniqueness of the solution of the equation of the form:\\ $H_{t}^{2}\left(x\right) -H_{t}\left( x\right) +t\equiv 0\ \ \left( \mathrm{mod}\text{ }t^{n}\right) $, by using the same recurrence formula introduced in \cite{wildberger2025hyper} between the Catalan sequence terms: $C_{n+1}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}C_{k}C_{n-k}$. We introduce Wildberger's polynumber sequences, binomial Chu-Vandermonde identity, truncated polyseries and finally modular resolution as application.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the solubility of homogeneous polynomial equations. The work of Browning, Le boudec, Sawin [3] shows that almost all homogeneous equations of degree $d\geq 4$ in $d+1$ or more variables satisfy the Hasse principle, and in particular that a positive portion possess a non-trivial integral solution. Our main result, when combined with our sequel joint work with H.Lee and S.Lee, shows that such a conclusion remains true even when the coefficients of homogeneous polynomials are constrained by a polynomial condition under a modest condition on the number of variables. To be precise, let $d$ and $n$ be natural numbers. Let $\nu_{d,n}: \mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^N$ denote the Veronese embedding with $N=\binom{n+d-1}{d}$, defined by listing all the monomials of degree $d$ in $n$ variables using the lexicographical ordering. Let $\langle \boldsymbol{a}, \nu_{d,n}(\boldsymbol{x})\rangle\in \mathbb{Z}[\boldsymbol{x}]$ be a homogeneous polynomial in $n$ variables of degree $d$ with integer coefficients $\boldsymbol{a}$, where $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ denotes the inner product. For a non-singular form $P\in \mathbb{Z}[\boldsymbol{x}]$ in $N$ variables of degree $k\geq 2,$ consider a set of integer vectors $\boldsymbol{a}\in \mathbb{Z}^N$, defined by $$\mathfrak{A}(A;P)=\{\boldsymbol{a}\in \mathbb{Z}^N|\ P(\boldsymbol{a})=0,\ \|\boldsymbol{a}\|_{\infty}\leq A\}.$$ We confirm that when $d\geq 4$, $n$ is sufficiently large in terms of $d$, and $k\leq d,$ the proportion of integer vectors $\boldsymbol{a}\in \mathbb{Z}^N$ in $\mathfrak{A}(A;P)$, whose associated equations $\langle \boldsymbol{a}, \nu_{d,n}(\boldsymbol{x})\rangle=0$ satisfy the Hasse principle, converges to $1$ as $A\rightarrow \infty$. We make explicit a lower bound on $n$ guaranteeing this conclusion. In particular, we show that when $d\geq 14$ it suffices to take $n\geq 32d+17$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $d$ and $n$ be natural numbers greater or equal to $2$. Let $\langle \boldsymbol{a}, \nu_{d,n}(\boldsymbol{x})\rangle\in \mathbb{Z}[\boldsymbol{x}]$ be a homogeneous polynomial in $n$ variables of degree $d$ with integer coefficients $\boldsymbol{a}$, where $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ denotes the inner product, and $\nu_{d,n}: \mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^N$ denotes the Veronese embedding with $N=\binom{n+d-1}{d}$. Consider a variety $V_{\boldsymbol{a}}$ in $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$, defined by $\langle \boldsymbol{a}, \nu_{d,n}(\boldsymbol{x})\rangle=0.$ In this paper, we examine a set of these varieties defined by $$\mathbb{V}^{P}_{d,n}(A)=\{ V_{\boldsymbol{a}}\subset \mathbb{P}^{n-1}|\ P(\boldsymbol{a})=0,\ \|\boldsymbol{a}\|_{\infty}\leq A\},$$ where $P\in \mathbb{Z}[\boldsymbol{x}]$ is a non-singular form in $N$ variables of degree $k$ with $2 \le k\leq C({n,d})$ for some constant $C({n,d})$ depending at most on $n$ and $d$. Suppose that $P(\boldsymbol{a})=0$ has a nontrivial integer solution. We confirm that the proportion of varieties $V_{\boldsymbol{a}}$ in $\mathbb{V}^{P}_{d,n}(A)$, which are everywhere locally soluble, converges to a constant $c_P$ as $A\rightarrow \infty.$ In particular, if there exists $\boldsymbol{b}\in \mathbb{Z}^N$ such that $P(\boldsymbol{b})=0$ and the variety $V_{\boldsymbol{b}}$ in $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ admits a smooth $\mathbb{Q}$-rational point, the constant $c_P$ is positive.</p></details>
