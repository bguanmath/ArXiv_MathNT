### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25039v1'>2512.25039</a>\]&nbsp; **The Hochschild homology of a noncommutative symmetric quotient stack**

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an orbifold type decomposition theorem for the Hochschild homology of the symmetric powers of a small DG category $\mathcal{A}$. In noncommutative geometry, these can be viewed as the noncommutative symmetric quotient stacks of $\mathcal{A}$. We use this decomposition to show that the total Hochschild homology of the symmetric powers of $\mathcal{A}$ is isomorphic to the symmetric algebra $S^*(\mathrm{HH}_\bullet(\mathcal{A}) \otimes t \mathbb{k}[t])$. Our methods are explicit - we construct mutually inverse homotopy equivalences of the standard Hochschild complexes involved. These explicit maps are then used to induce from the symmetric algebra onto the total Hochschild homology the structures of the Fock space for the Heisenberg algebra of $\mathcal{A}$, of a Hopf algebra, and of a free $λ$-ring generated by $\mathrm{HH}_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we introduce a new class of smooth partially proper rigid analytic varieties over a $p$-adic field that satisfy Poincaré duality for étale cohomology with mod $p$-coefficients : the varieties satisfying "primitive comparison with compact support". We show that almost proper varieties, as well as p-adic (weakly admissible) period domains in the sense of Rappoport-Zink belong to this class. In particular, we recover Poincaré duality for almost proper varieties as first established by Li-Reinecke-Zavyalov, and we compute the étale cohomology with $\mathbb{F}_p$-coefficients of p-adic period domains, generalizing a computation of Colmez-Dospinescu-Niziol for Drinfeld's symmetric spaces. The arguments used in this paper rely crucially on Mann's six functors formalism for solid $\mathcal{O}^{+,a}/π$ coefficients.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix a finite field $\mathbb{F}$. Let $\mathrm{VI}$ be a skeleton of the category of finite dimensional $\mathbb{F}$-vector spaces and injective $\mathbb{F}$-linear maps. We study $\mathrm{VI}^m$-modules over a noetherian commutative ring in the nondescribing characteristic case. We prove that if a finitely generated $\mathrm{VI}^m$-module is generated in degree $\leqslant d$ and related in degree $\leqslant r$, then its regularity is bounded above by a function of $m$, $d$, and $r$. A key ingredient of the proof is a shift theorem for finitely generated $\mathrm{VI}^m$-modules.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-31 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sajad Salami &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The splitting field of an elliptic surface $\mathcal{E}/\mathbb{Q}(t)$ is the smallest finite extension $\mathcal{K} \subset \mathbb{C}$ such that all $\mathbb{C}(t)$-rational points are defined over $\mathcal{K}(t)$. In this paper, we provide a symbolic algorithmic approach to determine the splitting field and a set of $68$ linearly independent generators for the Mordell--Weil lattice of Shioda's elliptic surface $Y^2=X^3 +t^{360} +1$. This surface is noted for having the largest known rank 68 for an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{C}(t)$. Our methodology utilizes the known decomposition of the Mordell-Weil Lattice of this surface into Lattices of ten rational elliptic surfaces and one $K3$ surface. We explicitly compute the defining polynomials of the splitting field, which reach degrees of 1728 and 5760, and verify the results via height pairing matrices and specialized symbolic software packages.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a finite group. Let $K/k$ be a Galois extension of number fields with Galois group isomorphic to $G$, and let $C \subseteq \mathrm{Gal}(K/k) \simeq G$ be a conjugacy invariant subset. It is well known that there exists an unramified prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $k$ with Frobenius element lying in $C$ and norm satisfying $\mathrm{N}\mathfrak{p} \ll |\mathrm{Disc}(K)|^α$ for some constant $α= α(G,C)$. There is a rich literature establishing unconditional admissible values for $α$, with most approaches proceeding by studying the zeros of $L$-functions. We give an alternative approach, not relying on zeros, that often substantially improves this exponent $α$ for any fixed finite group $G$, provided $C$ is a union of rational equivalence classes. As a particularly striking example, we prove that there exist absolute constants $c_1,c_2 > 0$ such that for any $n\geq 2$ and any conjugacy class $C \subset S_n$, one may take $α(S_n,C) = c_1 \exp(-c_2n)$. Our approach reduces the core problem to a question in character theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a complete classification of the homogeneous $3$-local representations of the twin group $T_n$, the virtual twin group $VT_n$, and the welded twin group $WT_n$, for all $n\geq 4$. Beyond this classification, we examine the main characteristics of these representations, particularly their irreducibility and faithfulness. More deeply, we show that all such representations are reducible, and most of them are unfaithful. Also, we find necessary and sufficient conditions of the first two types of the classified representations of $T_n$ to be irreducible in the case $n=4$. The obtained results provide insights into the algebraic structure of these three groups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 38 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>To every finite-dimensional $\mathbb C$-algebra $Λ$ of finite representation type we associate an affine variety. These varieties are a large generalization of the varieties defined by "$u$ variables" satisfying "$u$-equations", first introduced in the context of open string theory and moduli space of ordered points on the real projective line by Koba and Nielsen, rediscovered by Brown as "dihedral co-ordinates", and recently generalized to any finite type hereditary algebras. We show that each such variety is irreducible and admits a rational parametrization. The assignment is functorial: algebra quotients correspond to monomial maps among the varieties. The non-negative real part of each variety has boundary strata that are controlled by Jasso reduction. These non-negative parts naturally define a generalization of open string integrals in physics, exhibiting factorization and splitting properties that do not come from a worldsheet picture. We further establish a family of Rogers dilogarithm identities extending results of Chapoton beyond the Dynkin case.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we study how to compute the number of $K$-rational points with a given $j$-invariant on an arbitrary modular curve. As an application, for each positive integer $n$, we determine the list of possible numbers of cyclic $n$-isogenies an elliptic curve over some number field can admit. Similarly, for an odd prime power $p^k$, we calculate the possible values for the number of points above some $j$-invariant on Cartan modular curves $X_{\mathrm s}(p^k)$, $X_{\mathrm{ns}}(p^k)$ and their normalizers. Combining known results about images of Galois representations of CM elliptic curves with our work, we also devise a simple algorithm to determine the number of rational CM points on any modular curve.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a field with $\text{char}(k)\neq 2$. We prove that all maximal flags of composition algebras over $k$, appear as the $k$-rational $Sp_{6}$-orbits in a Zariski-dense $Sp_{6}$-invariant subset $V^{ss}\subset V=\wedge^{3}V_{6}$, where $V_{6}$ is the standard $6$-dimensional irreducible representation of $Sp_{6}$. This gives an arithmetic interpretation for the orbit spaces of the semi-stable sets in the prehomogeneous vector spaces $(Sp_{6}\times GL_{1}^{2},V)$ and $(GSp_{6}\times GL_{1}^{2},V)$. We also get all reduced Freudenthal algebras of dimensions $6$ and $9$, represented by the same orbit spaces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a field with characteristic different from $2$. In this paper, we describe the $k$-rational orbit spaces in some irreducible prehomogeneous vector spaces $(G,V)$ over $k$, where $G$ is a connected reductive algebraic group defined over $k$ and $V$ is an irreducible rational representation of $G$ with a Zariski dense open orbit. We parametrize all composition algebras over the field $k$ in terms of the orbits in some of these representations. This leads to a parametric description of the reduced Freudenthal algebras of dimensions $6$ and $9$ over $k$ (if $\text{char}(k)\neq 2,3$). We also get a parametrization for the involutions of the second kind defined on a central division $K$-algebra $B$ with center $K$, a quadratic extension of the underlying field $k$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field or a finite field. Let $π$ be a principal series representation of $GL_{2n}(F)$ induced from any of its maximal standard parabolic subgroups. Let $N$ be the unipotent radical of the maximal parabolic subgroup $P$ of $GL_{2n}(F)$ corresponding to the partition $(n,n).$ In this article, we describe the structure of the twisted Jacquet module $π_{N,ψ}$ of $π$ with respect to $N$ and a non-degenerate character $ψ$ of $N.$ We also provide a necessary and sufficient condition for $π_{N,ψ}$ to be non-zero and show that the twisted Jacquet module is non-zero under certain assumptions on the inducing data. As an application of our results, we obtain the structure of twisted Jacquet modules of certain non-generic irreducible representations of $GL_{2n}(F)$ and establish the existence of their Shalika models. We conclude our article with a conjecture by Dipendra Prasad classifying the smooth irreducible representations of $GL_{2n}(F)$ with a non-zero twisted Jacquet module.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We count the maximal lattices over $p$-adic fields and the rational number field. For this, we use the theory of Hecke series for a reductive group over nonarchimedean local fields, which was developed by Andrianov and Hina-Sugano. By treating the Euler factors of the counting Dirichlet series for lattices, we obtain zeta functions of classical groups, which were earlier studied with $p$-adic cone integrals. When our counting series equals the existing zeta functions of groups, we recover the known results in a simple way. Further we obtain some new zeta functions for non-split even orthogonal and odd orthogonal groups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Dedicated to the memory of John Coates, to appear in PAMQ

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the present paper, we obtain a general lower bound for the $2$-adic valuation of the algebraic part of the central value of the complex $L$-series for the quadratic twists of any elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$, showing that when the $2$-part of the product of Tamagawa factors grows, the $2$-part of the algebraic central $L$-value grows as well, in accordance with the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer exact formula. This generalises a result of Coates--Kim--Liang--Zhao to all elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. We also prove the existence of an explicit infinite family of quadratic twists with analytic rank $0$ for a large family of elliptic curves.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages, 2 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we generalize the following problem, which is called the rational angle bisection problem, to the $n$-dimensional space $k^n$ over a subfield $k$ of $\mathbb R$: on the coordinate plane, for which rational numbers $a$ and $b$ are the slopes of the angle bisectors between two lines with slopes $a$ and $b$ rational? First, we give a few characterizations of when the angle bisectors between two lines with direction vectors in $k^n$ have direction vectors in $k^n.$ To find solutions to the problem in the case when $k = \mathbb Q,$ we also give a formula for the integral solutions of $x_1{}^2+\dots +x_n{}^2 = dx_{n+1}{}^2,$ which is a generalization of the negative Pell's equation $x^2-dy^2 = -1,$ where $d$ is a square-free positive integer. Second, by applying the above characterizations, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the incenter of a given $n$-simplex with $k$-rational vertices to be $k$-rational. On the coordinate plane, we prove that every triangle with $k$-rational vertices and incenter can be obtained by scaling a triangle with $k$-rational side lengths and area, which is a generalization of a Heronian triangle. We also state certain fundamental properties of a few centers of a given triangle with $k$-rational vertices.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study \emph{unimodular fake} $μ's$, i.e. multiplicative functions $\mathfrak f: \N \to \mathbb{S}^1 \cup \{0\} $ determined by a fixed sequence $\{\varepsilon_k\}_{k\ge 0} \subset \mathbb{S}^1 \, \cup \, \{0\}$ via the rule $\mathfrak f(p^k)=\varepsilon_k$ for every prime $p$ and $k \ge 0$. The Dirichlet series of a given $\mathfrak f$ admits the Euler product $$ F_{\mathfrak f}(s)=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\mathfrak f(n)}{n^s} =\prod_p g_{\mathfrak f}(p^{-s}),\qquad g_{\mathfrak f}(u)=\sum_{k\ge0}\varepsilon_k u^k, $$ and the canonical zeta-factorization $$ F_{\mathfrak f}(s)=ζ(s)^{\,z}\,ζ(2s)^{\,w}\,G_{\mathfrak f}(s), \qquad z=\varepsilon_1,\ \ w=\varepsilon_2-\frac{\varepsilon_1(\varepsilon_1+1)}{2}, $$ where $G_{\mathfrak f}(s)$ is a holomorphic Euler product on $\Re s>1/3$. Assuming the Riemann hypothesis and Simple Zeros Conjecture, we derive an explicit formula for $A_{\mathfrak f}^{\exp}(x)= \sum_{n \ge 1} \mathfrak f(n) \, e^{-n/x} $ of the form $$ A_{\mathfrak f}^{\exp}(x) -Δ_1(x;z,w) = Δ_{1/2}(x;z,w)\;+\;\sum_ρΔ_ρ(x;z,w,\mathfrak f)\;+\;\mathcal E(x). $$ To our knowledge, our expansion is the first extension of the Selberg-Delange method for Dirichlet series of the form $ζ(s)^{\,z}\,ζ(2s)^{\,w}\,G(s)$ that, beyond the main term from $s=1$, also extracts lower-order contributions from the singularities on the critical line $\Re(s)=1/2$. On the other hand, we introduce a notion of \emph{bias} at the natural scale $x^{1/2}(\Log x)^{w-1}$ and obtain an explicit criterion distinguishing \emph{persistent}, \emph{apparent}, and \emph{unbiased} behavior in this regime.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a finite field, let $f$ be a function from $F$ to $F$, and let $a$ be a nonzero element of $F$. The discrete derivative of $f$ in direction $a$ is $Δ_a f \colon F \to F$ with $(Δ_a f)(x)=f(x+a)-f(x)$. The differential spectrum of $f$ is the multiset of cardinalities of all the fibers of all the derivatives $Δ_a f$ as $a$ runs through $F^*$. An almost perfect nonlinear (APN) function is one for which the largest cardinality in its differential spectrum is $2$. Almost perfect nonlinear functions are of interest as cryptographic primitives. If $d$ is a positive integer, then the power function over $F$ with exponent $d$ is the function $f \colon F \to F$ with $f(x)=x^d$ for every $x \in F$. There is a small number of known infinite families of APN power functions. In this paper, we re-express the exponents for one such family in a more convenient form. This enables us not only to obtain the differential spectrum of each power function $f$ with an exponent in our family, but also to determine the elements that lie in an arbitrary fiber of the discrete derivative of $f$. This differential analysis, which is far more detailed than previous results, is achieved by composing the discrete derivative of $f$ with some permutations and a double covering of its domain to obtain a function whose fibers can more readily be analyzed.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Kadar--Yu algebras are a physically motivated sequence of towers of algebras interpolating between the Brauer algebras and Temperley--Lieb algebras. The complex representation theory of the Brauer and Temperley--Lieb algebras is now fairly well understood, with each connecting in a different way to Kazhdan--Lusztig theory. The semisimple representation theory of the KY algebras is also understood, and thus interpolates, for example, between the double-factorial and Catalan combinatorial realms. However the non-semisimple representation theory has remained largely open, being harder overall than the (already challenging) Brauer case. In this paper we determine generalised Chebyshev-like forms for the determinants of gram matrices of contravariant forms for standard modules. This generalises the root-of-unity paradigm for Temperley--Lieb algebras (and many related algebras); interpolating in various ways between this and the `integral paradigm' for Brauer algebras. The standard module gram determinants give a huge amount of information about morphisms between standard modules, making thorough use of the powerful homological machinery of towers of recollement (ToR), with appropriate gram determinants providing the ToR `bootstrap'. As for the Brauer and TL cases the representation theory has a strongly alcove-geometric flavour, but the KY cases guide an intriguing generalisation of the overall geometric framework.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper proposes an alternative approach to formally establishing the correctness of the RSA public key cryptosystem. The methodology presented herein deviates slightly from conventional proofs found in existing literature. Specifically, this study explores the conditions under which the choice of the positive integer N, a fundamental component of RSA, can be extended beyond the standard selection criteria. We derive explicit conditions that determine when certain values of N are valid for the encryption scheme and explain why others may fail to satisfy the correctness requirements. The scope of this paper is limited to the mathematical proof of correctness for RSA-like schemes, deliberately omitting issues related to the cryptographic security of RSA.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a symmetrizable Kac--Moody algebra. Given a root $α$ and a real root $β$ of $\mathfrak{g}$, it is known that the $β$-string through $α$, denoted $R_α(β)$, is finite. Given an imaginary root $β$, we show that $R_α(β)=\{β\}$ or $R_α(β)$ is infinite. If $(β,β)<0$, we also show that the multiplicity of the root ${α+nβ}$ grows at least exponentially as $n\to\infty$. If $(β,β)=(α, β) = 0$, we show that $R_α(β)$ is bi-infinite and the multiplicities of $α+nβ$ are bounded. If $(β,β)=0$ and $(α, β) \neq 0$, we show that $R_α(β)$ is semi-infinite and the muliplicity of $α+nβ$ or $α-nβ$ grows faster than every polynomial as $n\to\infty$. We also prove that $\dim \mathfrak{g}_{α+β} \geq \dim \mathfrak{g}_α+ \dim \mathfrak{g}_β-1$ whenever $α\neq β$ with $(α, β)<0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be an affine or hyperbolic rank 2 Kac--Moody group over a finite field $\mathbb F_q$. Let $X=X_{q+1}$ be the Tits building of $G$, the $(q+1)$--homogeneous tree, and let $Γ$ be a non-uniform lattice in $G$. When $Γ$ is a standard parabolic subgroup for the negative $BN$--pair, we define Eisenstein series on $Γ\backslash X$ and prove its convergence in a half space using Iwasawa decomposition of the Haar measure on $G$. A crucial tool is a description of the vertices of $X$ in terms of Iwasawa cells. We also prove meromorphic continuation of the Eisenstein series. This requires us to construct an integral operator on the Tits building $X$ and a truncation operator for the Eisenstein series. We also develop the functional analytic framework necessary for proving meromorphic continuation in our setting, by refining and extending Bernstein's Continuation Principle.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field or a finite field. In this article, we obtain an explicit and complete set of double coset representatives for $S\backslash GL_{2n}(F)/Q$ where $S$ is the Shalika subgroup and $Q$ a maximal parabolic subgroup of the group $GL_{2n}(F)$ of invertible $2n\times 2n$ matrices. We compute the cardinality of $S\backslash GL_{2n}(F)/Q$ and also give an alternate perspective on the double cosets arising intrinsically from certain subgroups which are relevant for applications in representation theory. Finally, if $Q$ is a maximal parabolic subgroup of the type $(r,2n-r),$ we prove that $S\backslash GL_{2n}(F)/Q$ is in one to one correspondence with $ΔS_n\backslash S_{2n}/S_{r}\times S_{2n-r}$ leading to a Bruhat decomposition. The results and proofs discussed in this article are valid over any arbitrary field $F$ even though our motivation is from representation theory of $p$-adic and finite linear groups.</p></details>

As applications, we prove liftability along square-zero extensions to be a derived invariant (at least when $\mathrm{char}(k) \ne 2$), and exhibit cases where the entire (classical) deformation functor of $X$ is a derived invariant; this partially answers a question of Lieblich.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a condensable algebra in a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$. We define an action of the fusion category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ on the morphism space $\mbox{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(x,A)$ for any $x$ in $\mathcal{C}$, whose characters are generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of the Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\mathcal{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\mathcal{B}$ to $A^\mathcal{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOAs, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\mathcal{C}_A}$ where $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{M}_U$ is the category of $U$-modules. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\mathcal{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study two long-standing conjectures concerning lower bounds for the Betti numbers of a graded module over a polynomial ring. We prove new cases of these conjectures in codimensions five and six by reframing the conjectures as arithmetic problems in the Boij-Söderberg cone. In this setting, potential counterexamples correspond to explicit Diophantine obstructions arising from the numerics of pure resolutions. Using number-theoretic methods, we completely classify these obstructions in the codimension three case revealing some delicate connections between Betti tables, commutative algebra and classical Diophantine equations. The new results in codimensions five and six concern Gorenstein algebras where a study of the variety determined by these Diophantine equations is sufficient to resolve the conjecture in this case.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates finiteness conditions for gentle and skew-gentle algebras. First, we prove that a skew-gentle algebra is $τ$-tilting finite if and only if it is representation-finite, which extends the result for gentle algebras by Plamondon (2019). Second, using surface models, we characterize silting-discreteness for the perfect derived categories of graded gentle and skew-gentle algebras. Specifically, for a graded gentle algebra, silting-discreteness is equivalent to its associated surface being of genus zero with non-zero winding numbers for all simple closed curves. We further extend this geometric characterization to graded skew-gentle algebras via orbifold surface models.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A subspace $U$ of $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ is called \textit{cyclically covering} if the whole space $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ is the union of the cyclic shifts of $U$. The case $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ itself is the only covering subspace, is of particular interest. Recently, Huang solved this problem completely under the condition $\gcd(n, q)=1$ using primitive idempotents and trace functions, and explicitly posed the non-coprime case as an open question. This paper provides a complete answer to Huang's question. We prove that if $n = p^k m$ where $p = \mathrm{char}(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $\gcd(m, p)=1$, then $h_q(p^k m) = 0$ if and only if $h_q(m) = 0$. This result fully reduces the non-coprime case to the coprime case settled by Huang. Our proof employs the structure theory of cyclic group algebras in modular characteristic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $n\geq 2$ be an integer, $p$ be a prime number and $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Motivated by Schraen's thesis and Gehrmann's definition of automorphic simple $\mathscr{L}$-invariants, we study the first non-vanishing extension groups between a pair of locally $K$-analytic generalized Steinberg representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$. We study subspaces of these extension groups defined by using either relative conditions with respect to Lie subalgebras of $\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{l}_{n}$ (isomorphic to $\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{l}_{m}$ for some $2\leq m<n$) or maps between locally $K$-analytic generalized Steinberg representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ with different highest weights. The applications of these computations are two-fold. On one hand, we prove that a certain universal successive extension of filtered $(\varphi,N)$-modules can be realized as the space of homomorphisms from a suitable shift of the dual of locally $K$-analytic Steinberg representation into the de Rham complex of the Drinfeld upper-half space, generalizing one main result of Schraen's thesis from $\mathrm{GL}_{3}(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ to $\mathrm{GL}_{n}(K)$. On the other hand, we give a definition of higher $\mathscr{L}$-invariants for $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ (which we call Breuil-Schraen $\mathscr{L}$-invariants) and discuss its possible explicit relation to Fontaine-Mazur $\mathscr{L}$-invariants, using ideas from Breuil-Ding's higher $\mathscr{L}$-invariants for $\mathrm{GL}_{3}(\mathbb{Q}_p)$.</p></details>

Building upon the recent work by Erdős \emph{et al}, which proved the graphic nature of \( \mathrm{PD}_n \) for large \( n \) unconditionally, and for all \( n \) under RH, we provide the first explicit unconditional threshold such that:\\ (1) For all \( n \geq \exp\exp(30.5) \), \( \mathrm{PD}_n \) is graphic.\\ (2) For all \( n \geq \exp\exp(34.5) \), every realization \( G_n \) of \( \mathrm{PD}_n \) satisfies that \( (G_n, p_{n+1}-p_n) \) is DPG-graphic. Our proofs utilize a more refined criterion for when a sequence is graphic, and better estimates for the first moment of large prime gaps proven through an explicit zero-free region and explicit zero-density estimate for the Riemann zeta function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $C$ be a smooth projective absolutely irreducible curve of genus at least 2, defined over the rationals. For a number field $L$, we define the set of $L$-new points on $C$ to be $C(L)_{new} = \{P \in C(L) : \mathbb{Q}(P)=L\}$; this is the set of points on $C$ defined over $L$ but not any strictly smaller field. Let $n$ be at least 2. We conjecture that $C(L)_{new}$ is empty for 100 percent of degree $n$ number fields $L$ when ordered by absolute discriminant. For degrees $n=2$, $3$, we give sufficient criteria for our conjecture to hold in terms of an explicit model for $C$. For general $n$ we prove a theorem that harmonises with the conjecture. In particular, we verify our conjecture for $n=2$ and $C=X_0(N)$ for the $18$ values $N \ne 37$ such that $X_0(N)$ is hyperelliptic, and also for $n=3$ and $C=X_0(23)$, $X_0(29)$, $X_0(31)$, $X_0(64)$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $ p \ge 5 $ be a prime and let $ b, c \in \mathbb{Z} $. Denote by $ T_k(b,c) $ the generalized central trinomial coefficient, i.e., the coefficient of $ x^k $ in $ (x^2 + bx + c)^k $. In this paper, we establish congruences modulo $ p^3 $ and $ p^4 $ for sums of the form $$ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1} (2k+1)^{2a+1}\,\varepsilon^{k}\,\frac{T_k(b,c)^4}{d^{2k}}, $$ where $ a \in \left\lbrace 0,1\right\rbrace $, $ \varepsilon \in \{1,-1\} $, and $ d = b^2 - 4c $ satisfies $ p \nmid d $. In particular, for the special case $ b = c = 1 $, we show that \begin{align*} \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\left( 2k+1\right) ^{3} \frac{T_{k}^4}{9^k}\equiv -\frac{3p}{4}+\frac{3p^2}{4}\left( \frac{q_p(3)}{4}-1\right) \pmod{p^3}, \end{align*} where $T_k$ is the central trinomial coefficient and $q_p(a)$ is the Fermat quotient.</p></details>

> **Comment:** V3: abstract revised

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Raimi's theorem guarantees the existence of a partition of $\mathbb{N}$ into two parts with an unavoidable intersection property: for any finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, some color class intersects both parts infinitely many times, after an appropriate shift (translation). We establish a polynomial extension of this result, proving that such intersections persist under polynomial shifts in any dimension. Let $P^{(1)},\dots,P^{(f)}\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ be non-constant polynomials with positive leading coefficients and $P^{(j)}(0)=0$ for every $j$. We construct a partition of $\mathbb{N}^k$ into an arbitrarily fixed finite number of pieces such that for any coloring of $\mathbb{N}^k$ with finitely many colors, there exist $x_0\in \mathbb{N}$ and a single color class that meets all partition pieces after shifts by $x_0+P^{(j)}(h)$ in each of the $k$ coordinate directions, for every $j$ and infinitely many values $h\in \mathbb{N}$. Our proof exploits Weyl's equidistribution theory, Pontryagin duality, and the structure of polynomial relation lattices. We also prove some finite analogues of the above results for abelian groups and $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$.</p></details>

As a consequence, we obtain an efficient way to compute presentations of $Q_2(G_S)$, where $G_S$ is Galois group of the maximal extension of $K$ unramified outside of a finite set of primes $S$, for varying $K$. This includes the following cases (for $p$ any prime dividing $n$): $μ_p(\overline{K}) \not\subseteq K$; $S$ does not contain the primes above $p$; and $p=2$ with $K$ admitting real archimedean places. We also show how to recover the classical reciprocity law of the Legendre symbol from the graded commutativity of the cup product.</p></details>

We formulate standard Whittaker modules and reduce the problem of composition factors of these standard Whittaker modules to that of Verma modules in the BGG categories $\mathcal O$ of $\mathfrak q(n)$. We also obtain an analogue of Losev-Shu-Xiao decomposition for the finite $W$-superalgebras $U(\mathfrak q(n), E)$ of $\mathfrak q(n)$ associated to an odd nilpotent element $E\in \mathfrak q(n)_{\bar{1}}$. As an application, we establish several equivalences of categories of Whittaker $\mathfrak q(n)$-modules and analogues of BGG category of $U(\mathfrak q(n), E)$-modules. In particular, we reduce the multiplicity problem of Verma modules over $U(\mathfrak q(n), E)$ to that of the Verma modules in the BGG categories $\mathcal O$ of $\mathfrak q(n)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we discover a secondary term in the asymptotic formula for the mean value of Hecke--Maass special $L$-values $ L (1/2+it_f, f) $ with the average over $f (z)$ in an orthonormal basis of (even or odd) Hecke--Maass cusp forms of Laplace eigenvalue $1/4 + t_f^2$ ($t_f > 0$). To be explicit, we prove $$ \sum_{t_f \leqslant T} ω_f L (1/2+it_f, f) = \frac {T^2} {π^2} + \frac {8T^{3/2}} {3π^{3/2} } + O \big(T^{1+\varepsilon}\big), $$ for any $\varepsilon > 0$, where $ω_f$ are the harmonic weights. This provides a new instance of (large) secondary terms in the moments of $L$-functions -- it was known previously only for the smoothed cubic moment of quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions. The proof relies on an explicit formula for the smoothed mean value of $L (1/2+it_f, f)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 26 ppages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the approximation error $\varepsilon(x)=\mathrm{li}_{*}(x)-\mathrm{li}(x)$ arising from the classical Stieltjes asymptotic expansion for the logarithmic integral. Our analysis is based on the discrete values $\varepsilon_k=\varepsilon(e^{k})$ and their increments $Δ_k=\varepsilon_{k+1}-\varepsilon_k,$ for which we derive new unconditional analytic bounds. Using precise integral representations for each increment $Δ_k$, together with sharp upper and lower estimates for the associated kernel integrals, we obtain computable and uniform bounds for $\varepsilon_k$ for all $k\ge 1$, and hence for $\varepsilon(x)$ for all $x\ge e$. We prove the following unconditional bounds: $$\begin{array}{l} \displaystyle \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{\frac{2π}{\ln(x)}} + o\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\ln(x)}}\right) \le \varepsilon(x) \le \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{\frac{2π}{\ln(x)}} + o\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\ln(x)}}\right) \text{for all } e \le x \le e^{1000}, \end{array} $$ $$\begin{array}{l} \displaystyle \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{\frac{2π}{\ln(x)}} + o\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\ln(x)}}\right) - C_{l} \le \varepsilon(x) \le \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{\frac{2π}{\ln(x)}} + o\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\ln(x)}}\right) + C_{r} \text{for all } x>e^{1000} \text{ with } C_{l} = 0.0000035462\text{ and } C_{r}=0.0000021511. \end{array}$$ These results establish the first fully explicit global bounds for the Stieltjes approximation error. Finally, our findings strongly support the conjectural behaviour: $$ \varepsilon(x) = \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{\frac{2π}{\ln(x)}} + o\!\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\ln(x)}}\right), \qquad x\ge e. $$</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages + Appendix and References

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Coulomb-branch sector of 3D $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theories with half-hypermultiplets in general pseudoreal representations $\mathbf{R}$ ("noncotangent" theories). This yields (short) quantization of the Coulomb branch and correlators of the Coulomb branch operators captured by the 1d topological sector. This is done by extending the hemisphere partition function approach to noncotangent matter. In this setting one must first cancel the parity anomaly, and overcome an obstacle that $(2,2)$ boundary conditions for half-hypers are generically incompatible with gauge symmetry. Using the Dirichlet boundary conditions for the gauge fields and a careful treatment of half-hypermultiplet boundary data, we describe the resulting shift/difference operators implementing monopole insertions (including bubbling effects) on $HS^3$, and use the $HS^3$ partition function as a natural module on which the Coulomb-branch operator algebra $\mathcal{A}_C$ is represented. As applications we derive generators and relations of $\mathcal{A}_C$ for $SU(2)$ theories with general matter (including half-integer spin representations), analyze theories with Coulomb branch $y^2=z(x^2-1)$, compute the Coulomb branch of an $A_n$ quiver with spin-$\frac32$ half-hypers, and check consistency of a general monopole-antimonopole two-point function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Following work of Vélez, we explicitly describe the splitting of the integral prime 2 in the radical extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{a})$, where $x^n-a$ is an irreducible polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. With previous work of the second author, this fully describes the splitting of any prime in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{a})$. Using this description, we classify common index divisors (the primes whose splitting prevents the existence of a power integral basis for the ring of integers). Using work of Pleasants, we extend this to describe common $N$-index divisors (primes that divide the index of any order generated over $\mathbb{Z}$ by $N$ elements). We also present two novel constructions of non-monogenic fields with no common index divisors as well as constructions of number rings requiring $N$ ring generators for any $N>1$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a commutative algebra $A$ and a quotient $A$-algebra $A/I$, we construct a resolution of $A/I$ as an $A$-module such that it is also a differential graded (dg) algebra with divided powers (PD). This construction makes use of symmetric tensors in the symmetric tensor category of dg $A$-modules and does not require a Noetherian assumption on $A$. Moreover, the resolution has many lifting properties which we leverage to study the homotopy Lie algebra associated to the pair $(A,A/I)$, which is defined as the cohomology of the PD derivations of this PD dg algebra. Finally we investigate the complete intersection case in more details as well as connect it to the finite generation of the Yoneda algebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb{N}$ be the set of natural numbers and $\mathcal{S}=\big\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2,\cdots\big\}$ the set of squares. Let $\mathcal{W}$ be an additive complement of $\mathcal{S}$ and $$ f(n)=\#\big\{(w,m^2)\in \mathcal{W}\times \mathcal{S}: n=w+m^2\big\}. $$ It is proved that there is an absolute constant $c_0>0$ such that for all large $N$ we have $$ \sum_{n\le N}f(n)-N\ge c_{0}N, $$ which makes some further progress on a 1993 conjecture of Cilleruelo. As consequences of this result, we answer negatively a 2001 problem of Ruzsa as well as a 2017 problem of Ben Green.</p></details>

To do so we compute the K-theoretic analog of the Coulomb branches with symmetrizers introduced by Nakajima and Weekes. This yields an equivalence of the category O with a module category over a new type of quiver Hecke algebras. At the decategorified level, this establishes a connection between the Grothendieck group of O and a finite-dimensional module over a simple Lie algebra of unfolded symmetric type. We compute this module in certain cases and give a combinatorial rule for its crystal.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The irrationality exponent of a real number measures how well that number can be approximated by rationals. Real numbers with irrationality exponent strictly greater than $2$ are transcendental numbers, and form a set with rich fractal structure. We show that this set intersects the limit set of any parabolic iterated function system arising from the backward continued fraction in a set of full Hausdorff dimension. As a corollary, we show that the set of irrationals whose irrationality exponents are strictly bigger than $2$ and whose backward continued fraction expansions have bounded partial quotients is of Hausdorff dimension $1$. This is a sharp contrast to the fact that there exists no irrational whose irrationality exponent is strictly greater than $2$ and whose regular continued fraction expansion has bounded partial quotients.</p></details>

> **Comment:** The new version restricts the attention to the brick chain filtrations mentioned in the title. The further considerations have been deleted. There are no longer references to $τ$-tilting theory

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We deal with the category of finitely generated modules over an artin algebra $A$. Recall that an object in an abelian category is said to be a brick provided its endomorphism ring is a division ring. Simple modules are, of course, bricks, but in case $A$ is connected and not local, there do exist bricks which are not simple. The aim of this survey is to focus the attention to filtrations of modules where all factors are bricks, with bricks being ordered in some definite way. In general, a module category will have many oriented cycles. Recently, Demonet has proposed to look at so-called brick chains in order to deal with a very interesting directedness feature of a module category. These are the orderings of bricks which we will use. This is a survey which relies on recent investigations by a quite large group of mathematicians. We have singled out some important observations and have reordered them in order to obtain a completely self-contained (and elementary) treatment of the relevance of bricks in a module category. (Most of the papers we rely on are devoted to what is called $τ$-tilting theory, but for the results we are interested in, there is no need to deal with $τ$-tilting, or even with the Auslander-Reiten translation $τ$).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a Markov chain with very different mixing rates depending on how mixing is measured. The chain is the "Burnside process on the hypercube $C_2^n$." Started at the all-zeros state, it mixes in a bounded number of steps, no matter how large $n$ is, in $\ell^1$ and in $\ell^2$. And started at general $x$, it mixes in at most $\log n$ steps in $\ell^1$. But, in $\ell^2$, it takes $\frac{n}{\log n}$ steps for most starting $x$. The $\ell^2$ mixing results follow from an explicit diagonalization of the Markov chain into binomial-coefficient-valued eigenvectors.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the \emph{chamber zeta function} for a complex of groups, defined via an Euler product over primitive tailless chamber galleries, extending the Ihara--Bass framework from weighted graphs to higher-rank settings. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the Bruhat--Tits building of $\mathrm{PGL}_{3}(F)$ for a non-archimedean local field $F$ with residue field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. For the standard arithmetic quotient $Γ\backslash\mathcal{B}$ with $Γ=\mathrm{PGL}_{3}(\mathbb{F}_{q}[t])$, we prove an Ihara--Bass type \emph{determinant formula} expressing the chamber zeta function as the reciprocal of a characteristic polynomial of a naturally defined chamber transfer operator. In particular, the chamber zeta function is \emph{rational} in its complex parameter. As an application of the determinant formula, we obtain explicit counting results for closed gallery classes arising from tailless galleries in $\mathcal{B}$, including exact identities and spectral asymptotics governed by the chamber operator.</p></details>

These relations are called the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations. The strategy of the proof of the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations is based on the method of semi-infinite flag manifolds and the Borel-type presentation. In addition, we observe that the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations give a complete set of the defining relations of the quantum $K$-ring. This gives a presentation of the quantum $K$-ring of the flag manifold of type $C$, called the Whitney-type presentation, as a quotient of a polynomial ring, different from the Borel-type presentation.</p></details>

The conjecture is motivated in part by interpreting certain codimension $2$ submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^{2m+2}$ as complex hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^{m+1}$ and using the complex structure to provide a natural reformulation of the curvature condition.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In in a nutshell, the classical geometric $q$-Langlands duality can be viewed as a correspondence between the space of $(G,q)$-opers and the space of solutions of $^L\mathfrak{g}$ XXZ Bethe Ansatz equations. The latter describe spectra of closed spin chains with twisted periodic boundary conditions and, upon the duality, the twist elements are identified with the $q$-oper connections on a projective line in a certain gauge. In this work, we initiate the geometric study of Bethe Ansatz equations for spin chains with open boundary conditions. We introduce the space of $q$-opers whose defining sections are invariant under reflection through the unit circle in a selected gauge. The space of such reflection-invariant $q$-opers in the presence of certain nondegeneracy conditions is thereby described by the corresponding Bethe Ansatz problem. We compare our findings with the existing results in integrable systems and representation theory. This paper discusses the type-A construction leaving the general case for the upcoming work.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical Brun--Titchmarsh theorem gives an upper bound, which is of correct order of magnitude in the full range, for the number of primes $p\leqslant x$ satisfying $p\equiv a\bmod q$. We strengthen this inequality for different ranges of $\log q/\log x$, improving upon previous works by Motohashi, Goldfeld, Iwaniec, Friedlander and Iwaniec, and Maynard for general or special moduli. In particular, we are able to beat Iwaniec's barrier $q<x^{9/20-}$, and improve all existing inequalities in the range $x^{9/20}\ll q<x^{1/2-}$ by utilizing bilinear or trilinear structures in the remainder terms of linear sieve. The proof is based on various estimates for character and exponential sums, which we derive by appealing to arithmetic exponent pairs and bilinear forms with algebraic trace functions from $\ell$-adic cohomology, trilinear forms with Kloosterman fractions, and sums of Kloosterman sums from spectral theory of automorphic forms, as well as large value theorem for Dirichlet polynomials.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2003, Hikami and Kirillov uncovered an intriguing connection between torus knots $\mathcal{K}_{(P,Q)}$ and Virasoro minimal models $\mathcal{M}(P,Q)$ by relating the Kashaev invariants of the knots to the characters of the corresponding minimal models. In this work, we recover and extend this connection by combining the 3D--3D correspondence with a bulk--boundary correspondence. More concretely, we study the 3D $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories associated with torus-knot complements via the Dimofte--Gaiotto--Gukov construction and show that, in the infrared, these theories either flow to a unitary TQFT (when $|P-Q| = 1$), whose boundary chiral algebra reproduces that of the associated unitary minimal model, or to a 3D $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 SCFT (when $|P-Q| > 1$), which realizes the corresponding non-unitary chiral minimal model at the boundary after an appropriate topological twist. This framework yields new Nahm-sum-like expressions for the characters of Virasoro minimal models and other related rational conformal field theories, providing a systematic algorithm for constructing characters of rational VOAs directly from the combinatorial data of an ideal triangulation of a non-hyperbolic knot complement.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For simple, simply-connected compact Lie groups, Dynkin embedding indices obey a universal scaling law with a direct topological meaning. Given an inclusion $f:G\hookrightarrow H$, the Dynkin embedding index $j_f$ is characterized equivalently by the induced maps on $π_3$ and on the canonical generators of $H^3$, $H^4(B{-})$, and $H^4(Σ{-})$. Consequently, $j_f$ controls instanton-number scaling, the quantization levels of Chern--Simons and Wess--Zumino--Witten terms, and the matching of gauge couplings and one-loop RG scales. We connect this picture to representation theory via the $β$-construction in topological $K$-theory, relating Dynkin indices to Chern characters through Harris' degree--$3$ formula and Naylor's suspended degree--$4$ refinement. Finally, we apply these results to F-theory to explain the prevalence of index-one matter: we propose a ``genericity heuristic'' where geometry favors regular embeddings (typically $j_f=1$) associated with minimal singularity enhancements, while higher-index embeddings require non-generic tuning.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a fixed integer n, a pair of nonzero integers {a, c} is called a D(n)-pair if the product ac plus n is a perfect square. In this short note we prove that D(n)-pairs are asymptotically equidistributed (via their associated quadratic forms) among proper SL_2(Z)-equivalence classes of binary quadratic forms of discriminant 4n with fixed content. As a consequence, we obtain a more streamlined and simpler proof of Badesa's asymptotic formula for the number of D(n)-pairs.</p></details>
