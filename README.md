<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Extending Katz-Sarnak heuristics, Ballini-Lombardo-Verzobio [BLV25] conjectures a limiting distribution as $p \to \infty$ for $\# A_g(\mathbb F_p,t)$, the number of $g$-dimensional PPAVs over $\mathbb F_p$ with trace $t$, as a product of natural local factors $v_\ell(t)$ for non-archimedean places $\ell$ and the Sato-Tate measure $\text{ST}_g$ corresponding to $\infty$. We prove that their conjecture is true for all $g$. As a consequence, we obtain analogous results on the distribution of curves of genus $2$ and $3$, answering questions of Bergström-Howe-García-Ritzenthaler [BHLR24] and [BLV25].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of geometric purity in rigidly-compactly generated tt-categories by considering exact triangles that are pure at each tt-stalk. We develop a systematic study of this concept, including examples and applications. In particular, we show that geometric purity is, in general, strictly stronger than ordinary purity, and that it naturally leads to the notion of geometrically pure-injective objects. We prove that such objects arise as pushforwards of pure-injective objects from suitable tt-stalks. Moreover, we give a detailed analysis of indecomposable geometrically pure-injective objects in the derived category of the projective line. Under mild additional assumptions, we identify the geometric part of the Ziegler spectrum as a closed subset. As an application, we demonstrate that this new notion of purity can be used to tackle the problem of spatiality of the frame of smashing ideals via the geometric Ziegler spectrum. In particular, we show that our approach rules out the counterexamples of Balchin and Stevenson to existing methods.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we establish new irrationality criteria for certain sparse power series. As applications of these criteria, we generalize a result of Erdős and obtain several irrationality results for various infinite series involving the classical arithmetic functions. For example, we prove that for any integers $t\ge2$ and $k\geq0$, the numbers $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{d(n)^k}{t^{σ(n)}} \quad\text{and}\quad \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{d(n)^k}{t^{φ(n)}} $$ are both irrational, where $d(n)$, $σ(n)$, and $φ(n)$ denote the number of divisors, the sum of divisors, and Euler's totient functions, respectively.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the topology and the Hausdorff dimension of a random Cantor set with overlaps, generated by an iterated function system with scaling ratio equal to the Golden Mean. The results extend known formulas to a case where the Open Set Condition fails. Our methodology is based on the theory of expansions in non-integer bases.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12680v2'>2405.12680</a>\]&nbsp; **A universal group-theoretic characterisation of $p$-typical Witt vectors**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Supriya Pisolkar, Biswanath Samanta &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Revised version(8 pages). The non-commutative part of the previous version has been removed due to an error

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a prime $p$ and a commutative ring $R$ with unity, let $W(R)$ denote the group of $p$-typical Witt vectors. The group $W(R)$ is endowed with a Verschiebung operator $V: W(R)\to W(R)$ and a Teichmüller map $\langle \ \rangle: R\rightarrow W(R)$. One of the properties satisfied by $V, \langle \ \rangle$ is that the map $R \to W(R)$ given by $x\mapsto V\langle x^p \rangle - p\langle x \rangle$ is an additive map. In this paper we show that for $p\neq 2$, this property essentially characterises the functor $W$. Unlike other characterisations, this is a group-theoretic characterisation, in the sense that it does not use the ring structure of $W(R)$. Most constructions of the group of $p$-typical Witt vectors of non-commutative rings do not have a ring structure, and hence the above characterisation is more suitable for generalisation to the non-commutative setup.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 51 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any prime $p>0$, we prove that simple superspecial abelian surfaces over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ admit CM liftings after base change at most to $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$, by using the residual reflex condition (RRC) and Lie types. The CM-liftability of ordinary simple abelian surfaces is proved by Serre-Tate, and the CM-liftability of almost ordinary simple abelian surfaces is proved by Oswal-Shankar and Bergström-Karemaker-Marseglia, respectively. As there can only be ordinary, almost ordinary, or supersingular simple abelian surfaces over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$, our work is another step to complete the CM-liftability of simple abelian surfaces over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20536v1'>2601.20536</a>\]&nbsp; **A universal construction of $p$-typical Witt vectors of associative rings**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Supriya Pisolkar, Biswanath Samanta &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 17 pages, comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a prime $p$ and an associative ring $R$ with unity, there are various constructions of $p$-typical Witt vectors of $R$, all of which specialize to the classical $p$-typical Witt vectors when $R$ is commutative. These constructions are endowed with a Verschiebung operator $V$ and a Teichmüller map $\langle \cdot \rangle$, and they satisfy the property that the map $x \mapsto V\langle x^p\rangle - p\langle x \rangle$ is additive. In this paper, we adapt the group-theoretic universal characterization of classical $p$-typical Witt vectors proposed in arXiv:2405.12680 to the non-commutative setting. Our main result is that this approach yields a construction of Witt vectors for associative rings, denoted $E$, which specializes correctly to the classical Witt functor in the commutative case. The construction of $E$ is inspired by the Witt functor of Cuntz--Deninger, and we show that $E$ is a universal pre-Witt functor, subject to an explicit conjecture concerning non-commutative polynomials. We further introduce the notion of a Witt functor and construct a universal Witt functor $\hat{E}$, which is closely related to Hesselholt's Witt functor $W_H$. We suspect that $W_H$ is, in fact, the universal Morita-invariant Witt functor.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Matthew Krauel, Jamal Noel Shafiq, Simon Wood &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Conformal field theory and its axiomatisation in terms of vertex operator algebras or chiral algebras are most commonly considered on the Riemann sphere. However, an important constraint in physics and an interesting source of mathematics is the fact that conformal field theories are expected to be well defined on any Riemann surface. To this end, a thorough understanding of chiral torus 1-point functions, ideally including explicit formulae, is a prerequisite for a detailed understanding of higher genera. These are distinguished from characters or vacuum torus 1-point functions because the insertion point is explicitly allowed to be labelled by any module over the vertex operator algebra rather than just the vertex operator algebra itself. Compellingly, chiral torus 1-point functions exhibit interesting modular properties, which we explore here in the example of the simple affine $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ vertex operator algebras at non-negative integral levels. We determine the dimension of the space spanned by such functions, choose a natural basis to construct vector-valued modular forms and describe the congruence properties of these forms. In particular, we find explicit generators for the spaces of all vector-valued modular forms of dimension at most three, when the insertion comes from a simple module other than the vertex operator algebra. Finally, we use the fact that categories of modules over rational vertex operator algebras are modular tensor categories to give explicit formulae for the action of the modular group on chiral torus 1-point functions entirely in terms of categorical data. The usual modular $\mathsf{S}$ and $\mathsf{T}$ matrices of characters are known not to be complete invariants of modular tensor categories, so these generalised modular data are good candidates for more fine-grained invariants.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove asymptotic formulae for small weighted solutions of quadratic congruences of the form $λ_1x_1^2+\cdots +λ_nx_n^2\equiv λ_{n+1}\bmod{p^m}$, where $p$ is a fixed odd prime, $λ_1,...,λ_{n+1}$ are integer coefficients such that $(λ_1\cdots λ_{n},p)=1$ and $m\rightarrow \infty$. If $n\ge 6$, $p\ge 5$ and the coefficients are fixed and satisfy $λ_1,...,λ_n>0$ and $(λ_{n+1},p)=1$ (inhomogeneous case), we obtain an asymptotic formula which is valid for integral solutions $(x_1,...,x_n)$ in cubes of side length at least $p^{(1/2+\varepsilon)m}$, centered at the origin. If $n\ge 4$ and $λ_{n+1}=0$ (homogeneous case), we prove a result of the same strength for coefficients $λ_i$ which are allowed to vary with $m$. These results extend previous results of the first- and the third-named authors and N. Bag.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate Boston's generalization of the unramified Fontaine-Mazur conjecture for Galois representations. From a group-theoretic perspective, we first show that the conjecture can be reduced to the case of certain distinguished classes of $p$-adic analytic groups and $\mathbb{F}_{p}[[T]]$-adic analytic groups. Specifically, these are open subgroups of the groups of integral points of absolutely simple algebraic groups defined over non-Archimedean local fields. Furthermore, we provide a group-theoretic interpretation of the conjecture in terms of the virtually Golod-Shafarevich property. Finally, we establish a local-global principle and a prime-to-adjoint principle for the conjecture.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Joseph Bernstein, Dmitry Gourevitch, Siddhartha Sahi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 33 p. v4: substantial generalization

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Several important families of orthogonal polynomials on the real line are called ``hypergeometric'' since they can be explicitly described in terms of some hypergeometric series $_pF_q$ that uses the degree $n$ of the polynomial as a parameter. It is natural to ask if one can classify all such families. Indeed many classification results have been obtained in this direction, but only under the additional assumption that the polynomials are eigenfunctions of some second order operator. In this paper we initiate a new approach to this classification. We propose a definition of an HG family that makes precise, but also generalizes, the notion of a ``hypergeometric'' family. Our main result is that there are exactly 10 types of orthogonal HG families, 8 from the well-known Askey scheme and 2 additional types of families that can be expressed in terms of Lommel polynomials. Our methods in this paper are algebraic. In particular, we classify a wider class of quasi-orthogonal HG families, and this classification is valid over an arbitrary field of characteristic zero. We also define a more general class of rational HG families and prove a structure theorem for quasi-orthogonal families in this class. We provide examples for such families, that are in particular new families of orthogonal polynomials of potential interest.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 57 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms of cluster algebras and show that their induced action on the g-vectors can be realized by tropicalising their action on the homogeneous $\hat{y}$ (or $\mathcal{X}$) variables of a chosen initial cluster. This perspective allows us to interpret the action on g-vectors as a change of coordinates in the tropical setting. Focusing on Grassmannian cluster algebras, we analyse tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms in detail. We derive tropical analogues of the braid group action and the twist map on both g-vectors and tableaux. We introduce the notions of unstable and stable fixed points for quasi-automorphisms, which prove useful for constructing cluster monomials and non-real modules, respectively. As an application, we demonstrate that the counts of prime non-real tableaux with a fixed number of columns in $\mathrm{SSYT}(3, [9])$ and $\mathrm{SSYT}(4, [8])$, arising from the braid group action on stable fixed points, are governed by Euler's totient function. Furthermore, we apply our findings to scattering amplitudes in physics, providing a novel interpretation of the square root associated with the four-mass box integral via stable fixed points of quasi-automorphisms of the Grassmannian cluster algebra $\CC[\Gr(4,8)]$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 29 pages, 4 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study degenerate principal series representations of the split real group $G_{2(2)}$ induced from a character of a maximal parabolic subgroup whose unipotent radical is a Heisenberg group. Using the Lie algebra action on the space of $K$-finite vectors, we find the points of reducibility and the complementary series. The minimal representation and a limit of discrete series are identified as kernel of the corresponding Knapp-Stein intertwining operator. Moreover, we show that some quaternionic discrete series representations occur as the subrepresentation on which the family of intertwining operators vanishes of order two.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zbigniew Fiedorowicz, Muthu Veerappan Ramalingam &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.HO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 14 pages, 3 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is well known that there is a somewhat mysterious relation between the area of the quartic Fermat curve $x^4+y^4=1$, aka squircle, and the arc length of the lemniscate $(x^2+y^2)^2=x^2-y^2$. The standardproof of this fact uses relations between elliptic integrals and the gamma function. In this article we generalize this result to relate areas of sectors of the squircle to arc lengths of segments of the lemniscate. We provide a geometric interpretation of this relation and an elementary proof of the relation, which only uses basic integral calculus. We also discuss an alternate version of this kind of relation, which is implicit in a calculation of Siegel.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages, 4 figures, added a section on conjugacy classes of the symmetric group, added references, minor changes

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper discusses what the dimension data of irreducible representations of a finite group looks like in some specific cases, including unipotent and reductive groups over finite fields. The essence of our investigation is whether the dimension data of irreducible representations of a finite group can be ``geometerized'', to become equal to the cardinality of certain orbit spaces. The first part of this paper deals with nilpotent and reductive groups over finite fields, whereas the second part deals with the symmetric group $S_n$. The main conclusion that we want to bring out to contrast these two cases is that for reductive groups over finite fields, the dimension data is concentrated (in a statistical sense) in a neighborhood of the maximal dimension, whereas for the symmetric group, it is spread out.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 11 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent paper, we proved that for any large enough odd modulus $q\in \mathbb{N}$ and fixed $α_2\in \mathbb{N}$ coprime to $q$, the congruence $$ x_1^2+α_2x_2^2+α_3x_3^2\equiv 0 \bmod{q} $$ has a solution of $(x_1,x_2,x_3)\in \mathbb{Z}^3$ with $x_3$ coprime to $q$ of height $\max\{|x_1|,|x_2|,|x_3|\}\le q^{11/24+\varepsilon}$ for, in a sense, almost all $α_3$, where $α_3$ runs over the reduced residue classes modulo $q$. Here it was of significance that $11/24<1/2$, so we broke a natural barrier. In this paper, we average the moduli $q$ in addition, establishing the existence of a solution of height $\le Q^{3/8+\varepsilon}α_2^{\varepsilon}$ for almost all pairs $(q,α_3)$, with $Q$ large enough, $Q<q\le 2Q$, $q$ coprime to $2α_2$ and $α_3$ running over the reduced residue classes modulo $q$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a number field with algebraic closure $\overline{K}$ and let $S$ be a finite set of places of $K$ containing all the archimedean places. It is known from Silverman's result that a forward orbit of a rational map $\varphi$ contains finitely many $S$-integers in the number field K when $\varphi^2$ is not a polynomial. Sookdeo stated an analogous conjecture for the backward orbits of a rational map $\varphi$ using a general $S$-integrality notion based on the Galois conjugates of points. He proved his conjecture for the power map $\varphi(z) =z^d$ for $d \geq 2$ and consequently for Chebyshev maps (J. Number Theory 131 (2011), 1229-1239). In this paper, we establish uniform bounds on the number of $S$-integral points in the backward orbits of any non-zero $β$ in $K$, relative to a non-preperiodic point $α\in \mathbb{P}^1(\overline{K})$, under the power map $\varphi(z) =z^d $.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of AIR tilting subcategories of extended hearts of $t$-structures on a triangulated category associated with silting subcategories. This notion generalizes $τ_{[d]}$-tilting pairs of extended finitely generated modules over finite-dimensional algebras to a more general framework, which includes both extended large modules over unitary rings and truncated subcategories of finite-dimensional derived categories of proper non-positive differential graded algebras. Within this setting, we establish a bijection between AIR tilting subcategories and silting subcategories.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Bicritical rational functions -- those with precisely two critical points -- include the well-studied families of unicritical polynomials and quadratic rational functions. In this article we lay out general foundations for studying arithmetic dynamical properties of bicritical rational functions, and prove new Galois-theoretic results for a family with special properties. We study the field of definition of the critical points, and give a normal form up to Möbius conjugacy over this field. As a corollary, we show that after a finite extension of the ground field, the arboreal Galois representation attached to a bicritical rational function injects into an iterated wreath product of cyclic groups. We then examine the family of quadratic $φ\in \mathbb{Q}(x)$ with critical points $γ_1$ and $γ_2$ such that $φ(γ_1) = γ_2$. Adapting methods of Odoni-Stoll in the polynomial case to rational functions, we show that the arboreal representation is surjective for an infinite subfamily.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent paper, the authors introduced the notion of an alternating snake and a corresponding family of finite dimensional modules for the quantum affine algebra associated to $A_n$. We prove that under some restrictions, an alternating snake defines a canonical monoidal category. We prove that this category has finitely many prime objects. As a consequence we prove that the Grothendieck ring is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of the category $\mathscr C_ξ$ for a suitable height function. In particular it follows that the special family of alternating snakes provides a monoidal categorification of a cluster algebra of type $A_N$ for a suitable value of $N$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any integer $d \geq 2$ and prime power $q$, we construct unexpectedly large induced matchings in the point-line incidence graph of $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{d}$ by leveraging a new connection with the Furstenberg-Sárközy problem from arithmetic combinatorics. In particular, we significantly improve the previously well-known baselines when $q$ is prime, showing that $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}$ contains matchings of size $q^{1.233}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{d}$ contains matchings of size $q^{d-o_{d}(1)}$. These results and their proofs have several applications. First, we also obtain new constructions for finite field Nikodym sets in dimension $d \geq 2$, improving recent results of Tao by polynomial factors. For example, when $q$ is prime, we show the existence of Nikodym sets in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$ of size $q^d - q^{d - o_d(1)}$. Second, we construct a new minimal blocking set in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$, solving a longstanding problem in finite geometry. Third, we obtain new constructions for the minimal distance problem (in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and also in higher dimensions), improving a recent result of Logunov-Zakharov. We also obtain analogous results for general finite fields with large characteristics. In particular, in one of our constructions we introduce a new special set of points inside the norm hypersurface in $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{d}$, which directly generalizes the classical Hermitian unital and which may be of independent interest for applications.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a field and $X$ a smooth projective variety over $k$. When $k$ is a number field, the Beilinson-Bloch conjecture relates the ranks of the Chow groups of $X$ to the order of vanishing of certain $L$-functions. We consider the same conjecture when $k$ is a global function field, and give a criterion for the conjecture to hold for $X$, extending an earlier result of Jannsen. As an application, we provide a new proof of a theorem of Geisser connecting the Tate conjecture over finite fields and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture over function fields. We then prove the Tate conjecture for a product of a smooth projective curve with a power of a CM elliptic curve over any finitely generated field, and thus deduce special cases of the Beilinson--Bloch conjecture. In the process we obtain a conditional answer to a question of Moonen on the Chow groups of powers of ordinary CM elliptic curves over arbitrary fields.</p></details>

The proof introduces new ideas, and the structure and exposition have been reorganised accordingly. 30 pages, 2 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1990, Baker and Montgomery conjectured that $L'(s,χ_d)$ has $\asymp \log\log |d|$ real zeros in the interval $[1/2,1]$ for almost all fundamental discriminants $d$. The study of these zeros was motivated by their connection to real zeros of Fekete polynomials and to sign changes of the character sums $\sum_{n\leq x}χ_d(n)$. Recent work of Klurman, Lamzouri, and Munsch shows that the number of such zeros is $\gg (\log\log |d|)/(\log\log\log\log |d|)$ for almost all $d$, thereby establishing the conjectured lower bound up to the factor $\log\log\log\log |d|$. In this paper, we prove that for almost all fundamental discriminants $d$, $L'(s,χ_d)$ has at most $(\log\log |d|)(\log\log\log |d|)$ real zeros in $[1/2,1]$, thus resolving the Baker-Montgomery conjecture up to a factor of $\log\log\log |d|$. We also give a quantitative upper bound on the exceptional set of discriminants. Furthermore, we show, conditionally on certain natural assumptions, that $100\%$ of these zeros lie away from $1/2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a computational study of 200 composite integers of approximately 350 bits, engineered using the Arnault framework to pass all Miller-Rabin tests up to base 11. Generated at a rate of approximately 20 per hour from a high-throughput construction process producing ~7,700 Carmichael numbers per minute, all samples fail the strong Lucas probable prime test. We introduce the U-bit collapse metric delta = log_2(n) - log_2(U_d mod n) to quantify deviation from the expected uniform distribution of Lucas sequence terms. Analysis reveals minimal collapse values: mean delta = 1.61 bits, median delta = 1.0 bits, maximum delta = 8 bits, with 26% showing no measurable collapse. We analyze correlations with prime residue classes modulo 35, Arnault construction parameters (k,M), and composite bit-sizes. Our results demonstrate that composites engineered for Miller-Rabin resistance exhibit negligible Lucas sequence degeneracy, providing strong empirical evidence for the statistical independence of these two primality test components and supporting the continued robustness of Baillie-PSW-type tests.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish completely log-free bounds for exponential sums over the primes and the Möbius function. Let $0<η\leq 1/10$, and suppose $α= a/q + δ/x$, with $(a,q)=1$ and $|δ| \leq x^{1/5 + η}/q$, and set $δ_0 = \max(1, |δ|/4)$. For $x \geq x_0(η)$ sufficiently large, we show that: \begin{equation*} \Biggl| \sum_{n \leq x} Λ(n) e(nα) \Biggr| \leq \frac{q}{\varphi(q)} \frac{\mathscr{F}_η\bigl( \frac{\log δ_0 q}{\log x}, \frac{\log^+ δ_0/q}{\log x} \bigr) \cdot x }{\sqrt{δ_0 q}} \ \text{ and } \ \Biggl| \sum_{n \leq x} μ(n) e(nα) \Biggr| \leq \frac{\mathscr{G}_η\bigl( \frac{\log δ_0 q}{\log x}, \frac{\log^+ δ_0/q}{\log x} \bigr) \cdot x}{\sqrt{δ_0 \varphi(q)}}, \end{equation*} for all $1 \leq q \leq x^{2/5 - η}$, where $\log^+ z = \max(\log z, 0)$, and the functions $\mathscr{F}_η$ and $\mathscr{G}_η$ are explicitly determined, taking small to moderate values. These bounds improve substantially upon the existing results - particularly with respect to the permissible ranges of $q$, $δ$ in which log-free bounds are known to hold and potentially with respect to asymptotic functions $\mathscr{F}_η$ and $\mathscr{G}_η$ as well. Moreover, the range $1 \leq q \leq x^{2/5 - η}$ is essentially the best possible we can expect. The main innovation is a sieve-weighted version of Vaughan's identity (Lemma 2.1), which is effectively log-free. We employ several ideas and results from the pioneering work of Helfgott, and particularly, they play a central role in ensuring the log-freeness of the type-I contribution. Also, like in his work, these bounds improve as $δ$ increases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a framework of monoidal categorification of finite type cluster algebras involving triangulated monoidal categories. Namely, given a Dynkin quiver $Q$, we consider the bounded homotopy category $\mathcal{K}_Q^{(1)}$ of a symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{H}_Q^{(1)}$ that we define in terms of the Auslander-Reiten theory of $Q$. Using some iterated mapping cone procedure, we construct a distinguished family $\{ C_{\bullet}[β] \}_{β\in Δ_+}$ of chain complexes in $\mathcal{K}_Q^{(1)}$ characterized (up to isomorphism) by homological conditions similar to those of higher exact sequences appearing in the context of higher homological algebra. We then prove that the distinguished triangle in $\mathcal{K}_Q^{(1)}$ given by each mapping cone categorifies an exchange relation in the finite type cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}_Q$ with initial exchange quiver $Q$ (for a suitable choice of frozen variables). As a consequence, we obtain that for each positive root $β$, the Euler characteristic of $C_{\bullet}[β]$ coincides with the truncated $q$-character of the simple module $L[β]$ in the HL category $\mathcal{C}_ξ^{(1)}$ categorifying the cluster variable $x[β]$ of $\mathcal{A}_Q$ via Hernandez-Leclerc's monoidal categorification. Along the way, we establish a uniform formula for the dominant monomial of $L[β]$ in all types $A_n$ and $D_n$ for arbitrary orientations (agreeing with Brito-Chari's results in type $A_n$).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider Iwahori-Coulomb branches $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N},\mathbf{V}}^{\mathrm{Fl}}$, which are the affine flag analogs of the original Coulomb branches $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^{\mathrm{Gr}}$ defined by Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima. For any conical symplectic resolution $X$, we prove that the $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N},\mathbf{V}}^{\mathrm{Fl}}$-action on the localized equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$, induced by shift operators, satisfies a polynomiality property in terms of stable envelopes. We then study the case $X = T^*(G/P)$, the cotangent bundle of a flag variety, for which the Iwahori-Coulomb branch is isomorphic to the trigonometric double affine Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}_{G,\hbar,k}$. The polynomiality property enables us to compute explicitly the above action in terms of the Demazure-Lusztig elements and stable envelopes. Applications include: (1) Computation of the Iwarhori-Coulomb branch action for $G/P$ by taking the confluent limit, recovering Peterson-Lam-Shimozono's theorem. (2) Construction of an explicit Namikawa-Weyl group action on the equivariant quantum cohomology of $T^*(G/P)$ that preserves the quantum product, extending a result of Li-Su-Xiong. (3) Proof of a conjecture of Braverman-Finkelberg-Nakajima stating that, up to a shift of the dilation parameter, $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathfrak{g}^*}^{\mathrm{Gr}}$ is isomorphic to the spherical subalgebra of $\mathcal{H}_{G,\hbar,k}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $θ$ be an involution of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and $(\mathrm{U}_v,\mathrm{U}^\imath_v)$ be the associated quantum symmetric pair at an odd root of unity $v$. In this paper, generalizing the approach of De Concini-Kac-Procesi for quantum groups, we study the structures and irreducible representations of the iquantum group $\mathrm{U}^\imath_v$. We establish a Frobenius center of $\mathrm{U}^\imath_v$ as a coideal subalgebra of the Frobenius center of the quantum group $\mathrm{U}_v$. Via a quantum Frobenius map, we show that the Frobenius center of $\mathrm{U}^\imath_v$ is isomorphic to the coordinate algebra of a Poisson homogeneous space $\mathcal{X}$ of the dual Poisson-Lie group $G^*$. We define a filtration on $\mathrm{U}^\imath_v$ such that the associated graded algebra is $q$-commutative. Using this filtration, we show that the full center of $\mathrm{U}^\imath_v$ is generated by the Frobenius center and the Kolb-Letzter center, and we determine the degree of $\mathrm{U}^\imath_v$. We show that irreducible representations of $\mathrm{U}^\imath_v$ are parametrized by $θ$-twisted conjugacy classes. We determine the maximal dimension of those irreducible representations, and show that the dimension of an irreducible representation is maximal if the corresponding twisted conjugacy class has maximal dimension. We also study the branching problem for irreducible $\mathrm{U}_v$-modules when restricting to $\mathrm{U}^\imath_v$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ and $\ell$ be prime numbers, and $d\ge1$ an integer. We formulate and prove Iwasawa main conjectures of the Picard groups and Bowen--Franks groups in $\mathbb{Z}_p^d$-towers of digraphs. In particular, we relate the $\ell$ parts of these groups to certain $p$-adic $L$-functions defined using a voltage assignment. In the case where $\ell$ is not equal to $p$, we make use of the recent work of Bandini--Longhi to define the appropriate characteristic ideals. We also prove the growth of the $\ell$-part of these groups, generalizing classical results of Sinnott and Washington on ideal class groups of number fields. Finally, we introduce the concept of defect, which compare certain algebraic and analytic ranks related to Bowen--Franks groups and study their asymptotic behaviour in a $\mathbb{Z}_p^d$-tower.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The d'Arcais numbers are the triangular array $\{A(2,n,k)\, :\, n=0,1,\dots,\, k=0,\dots,n\}$, such that $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{n} A(2,n,k) x^k z^n/n! = ((z;z)_{\infty})^{-x}$. The infinite $q$-Pochhammer symbol is $(q;q)_{\infty} = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1-q^n)$. Holding $k$ fixed and considering large $n$, we note that the ratio $k! A(2,n,k)/n!$ is asymptotic to $C(k) σ_{2k-1}(n)/n^k$ where the divisor sum function is $σ_p(n) = \sum_{d|n} d^p$ and $C(k) = (ζ(2))^k/(Γ(k) ζ(2k))$. This is a slightly generalized version of one of Ramanujan's formulas from his paper, ``On Certain Arithmetical Functions," and it is an immediate consequence of the more recent article of Oliver, Shreshta and Thorne. Heim and Neuhauser made a conjecture, that $A(2,n,k)/A(2,n,k-1)$ is greater than or equal to $A(2,n,k+1)/A(2,n,k)$, for $k=2,3,\dots$ and all $n$. The conjecture is false for $k=2$, and it is true for $k=3,4,\dots$ when $n$ is sufficiently large. We consider the Hardy-Ramanujan circle method as a heuristic step.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 42 pages. v5: results on the sharpness of Fourier restriction are restated in terms of dimensions of sets and measures, more conjectures on higher dimensional orthogonal projection are proposed

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we construct a new family of sets based on Diophantine approximation in the Euclidean space, and consider their applications in several problems in harmonic analysis. Our first application is on the Hausdorff dimension of our sets. We show a recent result of Ren and Wang on the ABC sum-product problem is sharp. Higher dimensional cases and the relation to orthogonal projections are also discussed. Some conjectures are proposed. In addition to Hausdorff dimension, we also consider Fourier dimension. For every $0\leq t\leq s\leq 1$, we are able to construct a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that has Hausdorff dimension $s$ and Fourier dimension $t$, together with a measure $μ$ that captures both dimensions, i.e., $$μ(B(x,r))\lesssim_εr^{s-ε} \ \text{and} \ |\hatμ(ξ)|\lesssim_ε|ξ|^{-t/2 +ε}, \ \forall\,ε>0.$$ It is fundamental but the very first such result in the literature. Our last result is to provide a viewpoint of the sharpness of Fourier restriction over general measures from dimensions of sets and measures.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give an explicit description of the arithmetic-geometric extension of iterated Galois groups of rational functions. This yields a complete solution to the extension problem when either the arithmetic or the geometric iterated Galois group is branch, answering a question of Adams and Hyde. Furthermore, we obtain a sufficient condition for the arithmetic iterated Galois group of a rational function to have positive fixed-point proportion, which further applies in many instances to the specialization to non strictly post-critical points. In particular, this holds for all unicritical polynomials of odd degree, which greatly generalizes a result of Radi for the polynomial $z^d+1$. Lastly, we obtain the first family of groups acting on the $d$-adic tree whose fixed-point process becomes eventually $d$ for any $d\ge 2$ with positive probability. What is more, these groups are fractal and branch and thus positive-dimensional; hence they yield the first family of counterexamples to a conjecture of Jones for every $d$-adic tree.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This revised version incorporates a proof of the fact that the average order of the subclass of these height functions is inversely correlated to the asymptotic growth of their related multi-partition function

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The height $H(n)$ of $n$ is the least integer $i$ such that the $i$-th iterate of Euler's totient function $\varphi^{(i)}(n)$ equals $1$. H. N. Shapiro showed that this $H$ is almost completely additive. Building on the fact that this function can be modified to yield a completely additive function, we establish a general correspondence: to every multi-partition structure there corresponds a completely additive function. In this paper, a \emph{height function} is a completely additive map $H:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}_0$ with $H(1)=0$ whose prime fibres $\{p:\,H(p)=k\}$ are finite for every $k\ge1$. Writing $$ π_k=\#\{p:\,H(p)=k\},\qquad N_k=\#\{n:\,H(n)=k\}, $$ complete additivity forces the identity $$ \sum_{k\ge0}N_k q^k \;=\; \prod_{j\ge1}(1-q^j)^{-π_j}. $$ Thus, the prime--height profile $(π_k)$ canonically determines the height multiplicities $(N_k)$, linking to the asymptotic theory of weighted partitions. We introduce a broad class of iteratively defined heights on primes, encompassing Matula-type heights (encoding rooted trees) and Shapiro-type totient heights, and show they extend to genuine height functions. In the Matula case this yields a purely number-theoretic proof of the classical extremal bounds for minimal and maximal Matula numbers, answering a question of Gutman and Ivić without recourse to graph theory. Using Meinardus' theorem we prove an \emph{inverse-growth} principle in the polynomial regime: if $Π(x)=\sum_{j\le x}π_j \sim (C/α)x^α$, then $\log N_k$ satisfies a stretched-exponential law with an explicit constant, and conversely under a standard Tauberian hypothesis. We further derive average-order consequences in this regime for a canonical sequential realization of a given profile. Finally, we briefly discuss behavior beyond the polynomial setting, with computations in the Shapiro case suggesting substantially richer phenomena.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a smooth quasi-affine variety $X$, the affine closure $\overline{T^*X} := \text{Spec}(\mathbb{K}[T^*X])$ contains $T^*X$ as an open subset, and its smooth locus carries a symplectic structure. A natural question is whether $\overline{T^*X}$ itself is a symplectic variety. A notable example is the conjecture of Ginzburg and Kazhdan, which predicts that $\overline{T^*(G/U)}$ is symplectic for a maximal unipotent subgroup $U$ in a reductive linear algebraic group $G$. This conjecture was recently proved by Gannon using representation-theoretic methods. In this paper, we provide a new geometric approach to this conjecture. Our method allows us to prove a more general result: $\overline{T^*(G/H)}$ is symplectic for any horospherical subgroup $H$ in $G$ such that $G/H$ is quasi-affine. In particular, this implies that the affine closure $\overline{T^*(G/[P,P])}$ is a symplectic variety for any parabolic subgroup $P$ in $G$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the average size of a mixed character sum $$\sum_{1\le n \le x} χ(n) e(nθ) w(n/x)$$ (for a suitable smooth function $w$) is on the order of $\sqrt{x}$ for all irrational real $θ$ satisfying a weak Diophantine condition, where $χ$ is drawn from the family of Dirichlet characters modulo a large prime $r$ and where $x\le r$. In contrast, it was proved by Harper that the average size is $o(\sqrt{x})$ for rational $θ$. Certain quadratic Diophantine equations play a key role in the present paper.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 87 pages, 1 figure

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article is an expository account aimed at viewing entanglement in finite-dimensional quantum many-body systems as a phenomenon of global geometry. While the mathematics of general quantum states has been studied extensively, this article focuses specifically on their entanglement. When a quantum system varies over a classical parameter space, each fiber may look like the same Hilbert space, yet there may be no global identification because of twisting in the gluing data. Describing this situation by an Azumaya algebra, one always obtains the family of pure-state spaces as a Severi-Brauer scheme. The main focus is to characterize the condition under which the subsystem decomposition required to define entanglement exists globally and compatibly, by a reduction to the stabilizer subgroup of the Segre variety, and to explain that the obstruction appears in the Brauer class. As a consequence, quantum states yield a natural filtration dictated by entanglement on the Severi-Brauer scheme. Using a spin system on a torus as an example, we show concretely that the holonomy of the gluing can produce an entangling quantum gate, and can appear as an obstruction class distinct from the usual Berry numbers or Chern numbers. For instance, even for quantum systems that have traditionally been regarded as having no topological band structure, the entanglement of their eigenstates can be related to global geometric universal quantities, reflecting the background geometry.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Christol and, independently, Denef and Lipshitz showed that an algebraic sequence of $p$-adic integers (or integers) is $p$-automatic when reduced modulo $p^α$. Previously, the best known bound on the minimal automaton size for such a sequence was doubly exponential in $α$. Under mild conditions, we improve this bound to the order of $p^{α^3 h d}$, where $h$ and $d$ are the height and degree of the minimal annihilating polynomial modulo $p$. We achieve this bound by showing that all states in the automaton are naturally represented in a new numeration system. This significantly restricts the set of possible states. Since our approach embeds algebraic sequences as diagonals of rational functions, we also obtain bounds more generally for diagonals of multivariate rational functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For many common height functions, the explicit determination of the essential minimum is an open problem. We consider a classical method to obtain lower bounds that goes back at least to C.J. Smyth, and a method to obtain upper bounds based on the knowledge of the limit distribution of integral points. We use an infinite dimensional linear programming scheme to show that that both methods agree in the limit, by showing that the principle of strong duality holds in our situation. As a corollary we prove that the essential minimum can be attained by sequences of algebraic integers. Recent results by A. Smith and B. Orloski--N. Sardari, furnish a characterization of compactly supported measures that can be approximated by complete sets of conjugates of algebraic integers, in terms of infinitely many nonnegativity conditions. We establish an extension of this characterization to measures with non necessarily compact support. As an application of this result and of strong duality, we show that the essential minimum is a computable real number when the Green function used to define the height is computable. We systematically use potential theory for measures that can integrate functions with logarithmic growth.</p></details>

We then prove the existence of weight bases in tensor products by explicitly constructing some highest weight vectors. These constructions allow us to mimic the important aspects of the classical finite dimensional representation theory. Applications include a definition of rational representations, the BGG resolution, a Clebsch--Gordan formula, the Harish-Chandra isomorphism and central characters, as well as a classification and description of all irreducible polynomial representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide a writeup of a resolution of Erdős Problem #728; this is the first Erdős problem (a problem proposed by Paul Erdős which has been collected in the Erdős Problems website) regarded as fully resolved autonomously by an AI system. The system in question is a combination of GPT-5.2 Pro by OpenAI and Aristotle by Harmonic, operated by Kevin Barreto. The final result of the system is a formal proof written in Lean, which we translate to informal mathematics in the present writeup for wider accessibility. The proved result is as follows. We show a logarithmic-gap phenomenon regarding factorial divisibility: For any constants $0<C_1<C_2$ and $0 < \varepsilon < 1/2$ there exist infinitely many triples $(a,b,n)\in\mathbb N^3$ with $\varepsilon n \le a,b \le (1-\varepsilon)n$ such that $$ a!\,b!\mid n!\,(a+b-n)!\qquad\text{and}\qquad C_1\log n < a+b-n < C_2\log n. $$ The argument reduces this to a binomial divisibility $\binom{m+k}{k}\mid\binom{2m}{m}$ and studies it prime-by-prime. By Kummer's theorem, $ν_p\binom{2m}{m}$ translates into a carry count for doubling $m$ in base $p$. We then employ a counting argument to find, in each scale $[M,2M]$, an integer $m$ whose base-$p$ expansions simultaneously force many carries when doubling $m$, for every prime $p\le 2k$, while avoiding the rare event that one of $m+1,\dots,m+k$ is divisible by an unusually high power of $p$. These "carry-rich but spike-free" choices of $m$ force the needed $p$-adic inequalities and the divisibility. The overall strategy is similar to results regarding divisors of $\binom{2n}{n}$ studied earlier by Erdős and by Pomerance.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For integers $n,k \geq 1$, let $S_k(n)$ denote the power sum $1^k +2^k + \cdots + n^k$. In this note, we first recall the minimal recurrence relation connecting $S_k(n)$ and $S_{k-1}(n)$ established by Abramovich (1973). We then discuss an odd algorithm to determine the coefficients of the power sum polynomial $S_k(n)$ in terms of the coefficients of $S_{k-1}(n)$ (see, e.g., Bloom (1993) and Owens (1992)). Moreover, we bring to light an explicit relationship between $S_k(n)$ and $S_{k+1}(n)$ put forward by Budin and Cantor (1972). We conclude that these procedures (including the integration formula expressing $S_k(n)$ in terms of $S_{k-1}(n)$) all constitute equivalent methods to determine $S_k(n)$ starting from $S_{k-1}(n)$. In addition, as a by-product, we provide a determinantal formula for the Bernoulli numbers involving the binomial coefficients.</p></details>

The function thus satisfies an analogue of the Riemann Hypothesis together with the sharp bounded/unbounded transition at $σ= 1$ characteristic of $ζ$. The construction uses Hadamard products with controlled zero perturbations; the transition is proved unconditionally via a dyadic large-sieve argument and a Phragmén-Lindelöf transfer.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A. Bondal introduced a symplectic groupoid of triangular bilinear forms. This induces the Poisson structure on $\mathcal{A}_n$, the space of $n \times n$ unipotent upper-triangular matrices. L. Chekhov and M. Shapiro described log-canonical coordinates on this symplectic groupoid via the $\mathcal{A}_n$-quiver. In this paper, we introduce a birational Weyl group action on the symplectic groupoid. It is generated by cluster transformations associated with certain cycles of the quiver. We prove that every matrix entry of $\mathcal{A}_n$ is invariant under this action. Conversely, we prove that matrix entries generate the Poisson subalgebra of Weyl group invariants in the ring of regular functions on the cluster variety $\mathcal X_{|\mathcal A_n|}$. V. Fock and L. Chekhov defined a Poisson map $φ_n$ from the Teichmüller space $\mathcal{T}_{g,s}$ with genus $g$ and $s \in \{1,2\}$ boundary components into $\mathcal{A}_n$. We aim to describe the cluster structure of $\text{Im}(φ_n)$ by applying a Hamiltonian reduction to $\mathcal A_n$. Since every element in $\text{Im}(φ_n)$ satisfies the rank condition $\text{rank}(A+A^T) \le 4$, it provides a natural criterion for our Hamiltonian reduction. The solution set of the rank condition has distinct irreducible components, so the reduction might be component-dependent. However, we show that the Weyl group acts transitively on these components. This implies that the Hamiltonian reductions are conjugate; thus, it suffices to determine the reduction on a single component. Furthermore, we prove that the longest element of the Weyl group corresponds to a cluster DT-transformation on the $\mathcal{A}_{2k}$-quiver. In contrast, we show that no reddening sequence exists for odd $n$.</p></details>

The geometry of this representation is studied, including the geometric meaning of digits, properties of cylinder sets -- particularly the specificity of their overlaps -- and metric relations, as well as the connection between the representation and partial sums of the corresponding series. The paper also presents results on the study of a function $f$ defined by $f(x=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{α_n}{(r+1)^n})=Δ^{r_s}_{α_1α_2...α_n...}, α_n\in A.$ It is proved that the function $f$ is continuous at every point that has a unique representation in the classical numeration system with base $r+1$, and discontinuous at points having two representations. The function has unbounded variation and a self-affine graph. For $r<2s-1$, the function possesses singleton, finite, countable, and continuum level sets, including fractal ones; for $r>2s-2$, every level set is a continuum, and moreover it is fractal or anomalously fractal.</p></details>

Lately, interest has risen around a generalization of the theory of $(\varphi,Γ)$-modules, replacing the cyclotomic extension with an arbitrary infinitely ramified $p$-adic Lie extension. Computations from Berger suggest that locally analytic vectors should provide such a generalization for any arbitrary infinitely ramified $p$-adic Lie extension, and this has been conjectured by Kedlaya. In this paper, we focus on the case of $\mathbf{Z}_p$-extensions, using recent work of Berger-Rozensztajn and Porat on an integral version of locally analytic vectors and explain what can be the structure of the locally analytic vectors in the higher rings of periods $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}^{\dagger}$ in this setting. We show that the existence of nontrivial locally analytic vectors in $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}^{\dagger}$, a necessary condition for Kedlaya's conjecture to hold, is equivalent to the existence of an overconvergent lift of the field of norms attached to the $\mathbf{Z}_p$-extension. Finally, in the case where $K/\mathbf{Q}_p$ is unramified, we are able to prove that the only extensions for which such nontrivial locally analytic vectors exist are exactly the twisted cyclotomic extensions, up to a finite extension. In particular, this disproves Kedlaya's conjecture and also shows that there is no overconvergent lift of the field of norms in the anticyclotomic setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won introduced power circuits in 2012 to construct a polynomial algorithm for the word problem in the Baumslag group, which has a non-elementary Dehn function. Power circuits are circuits supporting addition and operation $(x,y) = x \cdot 2^y$ for integer numbers. Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won posed a question about decidability of the Diophantine problem over the structure $\langle \mathbb{N}_{>0}; +, x \cdot 2^y, \leq, 1 \rangle$, which is closely related to power circuits. In this paper we prove undecidability of the Diophantine problem over this structure.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define and study "tautological classes" in the cohomology of moduli stacks of shtukas, pursuing two directions of applications. First, we prove a formula relating the "arithmetic volume" of tautological classes to higher derivatives of Artin $L$-functions, which can be viewed as an arithmetic analog of Hirzebruch's Proportionality principle. Second, we define and analyze the structure of the "phantom tautological ring", using a general relation between Hecke correspondences and Vinberg's degeneration, and give applications to a function field analog of Colmez's Conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the zeros of theta functions $Θ_{Γ_{4k}}$ associated with the lattices $Γ_{4k}$, a family of self-dual lattices generalizing the $\mathsf{E}_{8}$ lattice. Our results show two different behaviors of the zeros according to the lattice parity: When $Γ_{4k}$ is an even lattice, we show that the zeros all lie on the line $\Re z =\frac{1}{2}$ in the fundamental domain and prove that the zeros are equidistributed with respect to an explicit probability measure on the line $\Re z = \frac{1}{2}$. However, when the $Γ_{4k}$ is an odd lattice, there are no zeros on the line $\Re z =\frac{1}{2}$, only exponentially close to it. Our argument relies on representing $Θ_{Γ_{4k}}$ as a polynomial in the modular $λ$-function. We then study the zeros of this polynomial and exploit some conformal properties of $λ$ to get our results.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates bipartite variants of generalized Diophantine tuples and their applications. We generalize a result of Bugeaud--Dujella on a special family of bipartite Diophantine tuples and affirmatively resolve a related question posed by the second author. Additionally, we establish new connections between bipartite Diophantine tuples and several known variants of Diophantine tuples, including those introduced by Banks--Luca--Szalay and Kihel--Kihel.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the tensor product of Demazure crystals for symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebras. It is not necessary that the tensor product of Demazure crystals is isomorphic to a disjoint union of Demazure crystals. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the decomposition of the tensor product of Demazure crystals as a disjoint union of Demazure crystals. Our results are the generalization of the results proved by Anthony Joseph and Takafumi Kouno. As an application, we obtain a sufficient condition when the product of Demazure characters is a linear combination of Demazure characters with nonnegative integer coefficients. In particular, we obtain a partial solution for the key positivity problem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Relatively little is known about the arithmetic properties of Gamma-function derivatives evaluated at arbitrary points $q\in\mathbb{Q}\setminus\mathbb{Z}_{\leq0}$. In recent work, we showed that elements of the sequence $\left\{ Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(1\right)\right\} _{n\geq1}$ are transcendental infinitely often. This result is now generalized to all sequences $\left\{ Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(q\right)\right\} _{n\geq1}$ for $q\in\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}\setminus\mathbb{Z}_{\leq0}$. Furthermore, for $q\in\mathbb{Q}\setminus\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}$ we show that at least one of the sequences $\left\{ Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(q\right)\right\} _{n\geq1}$, $\left\{ Γ^{\left(n\right)}\left(1-q\right)\right\} _{n\geq1}$ contains infinitely many transcendental elements.</p></details>
