### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15268v2'>2601.15268</a>\]&nbsp; **On the Real Zeroes of Half-integral Weight Hecke Cusp Forms, II**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jesse Jääsaari &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that for $\gg K^2$ of the half-integral weight Hecke cusp forms in the Kohnen plus subspaces with weight bounded by a large parameter $K$, the number of "real" zeroes grows at the expected rate. A key technical step in the proof is to obtain sharp bounds for the mollified first and second moments of quadratic twists of modular $L$-functions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sean Howe &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** v2 - Section 10 updated to use Kim's results on Igusa stacks + other minor edits

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the theory of inscribed $v$-sheaves, a differentiable extension of the theory of diamonds and $v$-sheaves with internal tangent bundles that are often relative inscribed Banach-Colmez spaces, then apply this theory to the study of $p$-adic periods. In particular, we construct natural inscribed versions of the Hodge and Hodge-Tate period maps and their lattice refinements for de Rham torsors, then compute the derivatives of these period maps in terms of classical structures in $p$-adic Hodge theory. These torsors include infinite level global Shimura varieties and infinite level local Shimura varieties, and for these spaces we also give another moduli-theoretic construction of the inscribed structure; the construction in the local Shimura case applies more generally to the non-minuscule moduli of mixed characterisic local shtukas with one leg. The key new ingredients in our study of inscribed structures on $p$-adic Lie group torsors over smooth rigid varieties over a $p$-adic field are the Liu-Zhu period map, a refinement of the Hodge period map whose derivative is the geometric Sen morphism/canonical Higgs field, and a closely related exact tensor functor from $\mathbb{Q}_p$-local systems to a category of twistor bundles on the relative thickened Fargues-Fontaine curve. These new structures are only visible after passing to the inscribed setting. We also discuss some possible implications of our computations in the vein of ``differential topology for diamonds."</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Thanasis Bouganis, Rafail Psyroukis &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 41 pages, lifted the assumption Cl(K)=1 from the main Theorem

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a Dirichlet series $D(F,G;s)$ attached to two automorphic forms $F$ and $G$ of an orthogonal group of real signature $(2,4)$, involving their Fourier--Jacobi coefficients. When $F$ is a Hecke eigenform and $G$ a lift of a Jacobi-Poincaré series, our main result gives that $D(F,G;s)$ is equal to the standard $L$-function attached to $F$, up to an explicit constant. To establish this, we use a correspondence between binary Hermitian forms and ideals of quaternion algebras, as established by Latimer, together with the fact that the even Clifford algebra of a three-dimensional definite quadratic space can be identified with a quaternion division algebra. Our work should be seen as a generalisation of a work of Kohnen and Skoruppa, whose result corresponds to the case of the orthogonal group of real signature $(2,3)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $\mathcal{A}_t$, the Auslander algebra of $K[x]/(x^t)$, it is shown that every complete exceptional sequence of $\mathcal{A}_t$-modules is a complete $τ$-exceptional sequence. Moreover, it is established that the mutation of complete $τ$-exceptional sequences generalises the mutation of complete exceptional sequences in the category of $\mathcal{A}_t$-modules.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hong Chen, Apoorva Khare, Siddhartha Sahi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 32 pages; small rewordings and reorderings of some of the statements; and some typos were fixed. Also added Remark 3.6 about asymptotes

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Majorization inequalities have a long history, going back to Maclaurin and Newton. They were recently studied for several families of symmetric functions, including by Cuttler--Greene--Skandera (2011), Sra (2016), Khare--Tao (2021), McSwiggen--Novak (2022), and Chen--Sahi (2024+) among others. Here we extend the inequalities by these authors to Jack and Macdonald polynomials, and obtain conjectural characterizations of majorization and of weak majorization of the underlying partitions. We prove these characterizations for two variables. In fact, we upgrade -- and prove in the above cases -- the characterization of majorization, to containment of Jack and Macdonald differences lying in the Muirhead semiring.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ian Le, Emine Yıldırım &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The homogeneous coordinate ring of the Grassmannian $\rm{Gr}(k,n)$ has a well-known cluster structure. There is a categorification of this cluster structure via a category of modules for a ring $A_{k,n}$ due to Jensen-King-Su, building on work of Geiss-Leclerc-Schröer, in which cluster variables correspond to indecomposable rigid modules. We give a combinatorial description of modules that correspond to rank $2$ cluster variables by using webs. This conjecturally gives the categorification of all rank $2$ cluster variables.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study an analogue of a classical arithmetic problem over the ring of polynomials.

> **Comment:** 35 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we analyze the structure of the category of partial representations of a finite group $G$ as a multifusion category, providing an alternative way to describe simple objects and their tensor products. We describe the interconnection between the category of partial representations of a finite group and the category of global representations of its subgroups (the Christmas Tree's Theorem). Also, for a finite abelian group $G$, we prove that the category of partial representations of any of its subgroups can be embedded into the category of partial representations of $G$ (the Matryoshka's Theorem).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine the number of local Arthur packets containing a certain fixed tempered representation for classical $p$-adic groups. More specifically, given a tempered extended multi-segment supported in the integers, we determine a count for all extended multi-segments which arise from it through applications of the operators arising from the theory of intersections of local Arthur packets.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Toni Annala, Elden Elmanto &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Submitted version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct motivic power operations on the mod-$p$ motivic cohomology of $\Fb_p$-schemes using a motivic refinement of Nizioł's theorem. The key input is a purity theorem for motivic cohomology established by Levine. Our operations satisfy the expected properties (naturality, Adem relations, and the Cartan formula) for all bidegrees, generalizing previous results of Primozic which were only know along the ``Chow diagonal.'' We offer geometric applications of our construction: 1) an example of non-(quasi-)smoothable algebraic cycle at the characteristic, 2) an answer to the motivic Steenrod problem at the characteristic, 3) a counterexample to the integral version of a crystalline Tate conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $χ_k$ a self$-$dual primitive Dirichlet character mod $k$ several reduced identities of Dirichlet $L-$functions $L_k(s):=L(s,χ_k)$, expressed as linear combinations of Hurwitz $ζ$ functions, are found for $s=2,3$ and some selected values of $k$. By using a merged approach between the Wilf$-$Zeilberger method and a Dougall$'$s $_5H_5$ technique, new proven accelerated series of hypergeometric$-$type are derived for specific Hurwitz $ζ$ function values. These fast series that are computed by means of the binary splitting algorithm, enter into the reduced identities found producing very efficient formulas to compute selected $L-$function values. The new algorithms include $L_k(2)$ for $k = -4$ Catalan's constant, $-7, -8, -15, -20, -24$ together with $L_k(3)$ for $k = 1$ Apery's constant, $5, 8$ and $12$. Formulas were tested and verified up to 100 million decimal places for each $L-$value.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 31 pages, 9 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the pair correlations of the logarithms of the integral values of quadratic norm forms at various scalings, proving the existence of pair correlation measures. We describe a surprising set of asymptotic behaviours when the scaling increases, passing from a punctual measure to a Poissonian behaviour through an exotic behaviour at the transition phase.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages. Rewritten version of §7 of arXiv:2403.04663v3 reorganised into a separate manuscript, v2: added §6 discussing the 2-adic case

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal G\simeq H\rtimesΓ$ be the semidirect product of a finite group $H$ and $Γ\simeq\mathbb Z_p$. Let $ F/\mathbb Q_p$ be a finite extension with ring of integers $\mathcal O_F$. Then the total ring of quotients $\mathcal Q^F(\mathcal G)$ of the completed group ring $\mathcal O_F[[\mathcal G]]$ is semisimple artinian. We determine its Wedderburn decomposition in full generality in terms of the Wedderburn decomposition of the group ring $ F[H]$. Such a description was previously available only for those simple components for which a certain associated field extension is totally ramified.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the representation growth of split extensions of $SL_2^m(O)$. We prove that the corresponding representation zeta functions factor as a product of the representation zeta function of $SL_2^m(O)$ and the relative representation zeta function associated to the extension. We make use of our result by computing the zeta functions for two infinite families of split extensions of $SL_2^m(O)$ explicitly. Along the way, we compute the representation zeta functions of a large class of subgroups of $SL_2^m(O)$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Adèle Bourgeois, Monica Nevins &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 25 pages; comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a $p$-adic group $G=\mathbf{G}(F)$ and a finite group $Γ\subset\mathrm{Aut}_F(\mathbf{G})$ such that the fixed-point subgroup $\mathbf{G}^Γ$ is reductive, we show that every semisimple character (in the sense of Bushnell and Kutzko) of a type for $G^Γ= \mathbf{G}^Γ(F)$ arises as the restriction of a semisimple character of a type for $G$. We achieve this by explicitly lifting the truncated Kim--Yu datum (or character-datum) that parametrizes the semisimple character for $G^Γ$ to a character-datum that parametrizes a semisimple character for $G$. Our proof, which is of independent interest, uses state-of-the-art techniques and, as a special case, defines a lift of a Howe factorization of a character of a maximal torus of $G^Γ$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Chen Wang, He-Xia Ni &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 16 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a parametric supercongruence related to Whipple's ${}_5F_4$ formula and Dwork's dash operation. As a typical consequence, we obtain the following result: for any prime $p\equiv3\pmod4$ and odd integer $r\geq1$, $$ \sum_{k=0}^{p^r-1}(8k+1)\frac{(\frac14)_k^3(\frac12)_k}{(1)_k^3(\frac34)_k}\equiv 3p^r+\frac{27p^{3r}}{4}H_{(p^r-3)/4}^{(2)}\pmod{p^{r+3}}, $$ where $(x)_n=x(x+1)\cdots(x+n-1)$ is the Pochhammer symbol and $H_n^{(2)}=\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{k^2}$ is the $n$-th harmonic number of order $2$. This confirms a conjecture of Guo and Zhao [Forum Math. 38 (2026), 1099-1109]. Our proof rely on a new parametric WZ pair which allows us to transform the original sum to a computable form in the sense of congruence. Another essential ingredient of our proof involves the properties of Dwork's dash operation.</p></details>

We thereby also cover other fast growing sequences like A014644, which we call golombic due to their strong ties with Golomb's sequence A001462.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We relate the theory of purity of a locally finitely presented category with products to the study of exact structures on the full subcategory of finitely presented objects. Properties in the context of purity are translated to properties about exact structures. We specialize to the case of a module category over an Artin algebra and show that generic modules are in one to one correspondence with particular maximal exact structures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present an explicit expression of the cohomology complex of a constructible sheaf of abelian groups on the small étale site of an irreducible curve over an algebraically closed field, when the torsion of the sheaf is invertible in the field. This expression only involves finite groups, and is functorial in both the curve and the sheaf. In particular, we explain how to compute the Galois action on this complex. We also present an algorithm which computes it and study its complexity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The proof of the inductive McKay condition has been shown to imply that the character theory above the characters of degree not divisible by $p$ of a normal subgroup is locally determined. In this note, we establish a similar result for the Isaacs' head characters of a normal solvable subgroup of an arbitrary group.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article focuses on some rings of integers of number fields which are known to be norm-Euclidean domains, but for which no explicit algorithm computing the Euclidean division has yet been studied or implemented. The rings of integers we are interested in were proven to be Euclidean by H.W. Lenstra, Jr in 1978; they include the $n$-th cyclotomic rings for $n=15,20,24$. We present an algorithm performing Euclidean division in these rings based on Lenstra's proof and a closest vector computation by Conway and Sloane, and study its complexity. We give a complete implementation of the algorithm in SageMath. We also estimate the size of the remainders obtained when computing Euclidean divisions with this algorithm.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider $m\times n$ rectangular matrices formed from Sturmian words with slope $α$ and we fully characterise their balance properties in terms of the Ostrowski representations of $m$ an $n$ with respect to $α$. This generalises recent results by Anselmo et al., as well as by Shallit and Vukusic, where only quadratic irrationals $α$ were considered. In contrast to the two mentioned papers, our approach is based on the distribution of $nα\bmod 1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any type of fundamental groupoid scheme, we construct an algebraic cohomology theory for varieties with coefficients in the base field. This is a minor variant of étale cohomology, involving neither de Rham complexes nor hypercohomology. The main idea is to delegate the role of étale morphisms to fundamental groupoids, thereby bypassing the Grothendieck topology. To validate this theory, we prove a comparison theorem between the algebraically defined cohomology using the pro-algebraic fundamental groupoid over $\mathbb{C}$ and singular cohomology. Furthermore, our construction naturally extends to other types of fundamental groupoids, providing a uniform foundation for various cohomology theories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any skew symmetric matrix over complex numbers, we introduce an EALA and it is called Skew Symmetric Extended Affine Lie Algebra (SSEALA).

We classify all such modules in the level zero case with non-degenerate skew symmetric matrix.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Josef Dick, Takashi Goda, Kosuke Suzuki &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the quasi-uniformity properties of digital nets, a class of quasi-Monte Carlo point sets. Quasi-uniformity is a space-filling property used for instance in experimental designs and radial basis function approximation. However, it has not been investigated so far whether common low-discrepancy digital nets are quasi-uniform, with the exception of the two-dimensional Sobol' sequence, which has recently been shown not to be quasi-uniform. In this paper, with the goal of constructing quasi-uniform low-discrepancy digital nets, we introduce the notion of well-separated point sets and provide an algebraic criterion to determine whether a given sequence of digital nets is well-separated. Using this criterion, we present an example of a two-dimensional digital net which has low-discrepancy and is quasi-uniform. Additionally, we provide several counterexamples of low-discrepancy digital nets that are not quasi-uniform.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-13 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Josef Dick, Takashi Goda, Gerhard Larcher, Friedrich Pillichshammer, Kosuke Suzuki &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The discrepancy of a point set quantifies how well the points are distributed, with low-discrepancy point sets demonstrating exceptional uniform distribution properties. Such sets are integral to quasi-Monte Carlo methods, which approximate integrals over the unit cube for integrands of bounded variation. In contrast, quasi-uniform point sets are characterized by optimal separation and covering radii, making them well-suited for applications such as radial basis function approximation. This paper explores the quasi-uniformity properties of quasi-Monte Carlo point sets constructed from lattices and also Kronecker sequences. Specifically, we analyze rank-1 lattice point sets, Fibonacci lattice point sets, Frolov point sets, and Kronecker sequences (also referred to as $(n \boldsymbolα)$-sequences), providing insights into their potential for use in applications that require both low-discrepancy and quasi-uniform distribution. As an example, we show that the $(n \boldsymbolα)$-sequence with $α_j = 2^{j/(d+1)}$ for $j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, d\}$ is quasi-uniform and has low-discrepancy. The quasi-uniformity properties of quasi-Monte Carlo digital nets and sequences will be studied in a companion paper.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $Π_{(b^a)}$ be the locus of unordered set partitions of $[ab]$ with $a$ blocks of size $b$. We embed unordered set partitions of $[n]$ into the affine space $\mathbb{C}^{\binom{[n]}{2}}$ with coordinate ring $\mathbb{C}\Big[\mathbf{x}_{\binom{[n]}{2}}\Big]$. Then, we apply orbit harmonics to $Π_{(2^a)}$ and $Π_{(a^2)}$, yielding graded $\mathfrak{S}_{2a}$-modules whose graded character formulae respectively refine the Schur expansions of $h_a[h_2]$ and $h_2[h_a]$ according to $λ_1$. We further extend this $λ_1$-separation phenomenon to quotients of $\mathbb{C}^{\binom{[n]}{2}}$ where $n$ is odd. Combining $Π_{(b^a)},Π_{(a^b)}$ and orbit harmonics, we propose a conjecture related to Foulkes' conjecture, and we prove the special case $b=2$. We also apply orbit harmonics to the locus $Π_{n,m}$ of unordered set partitions of $[n]$ without blocks of size greater than $m$, yielding a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n$-module $R(Π_{n,m})$. We determine the standard monomial basis of $R(Π_{n,m})$ with respect to any monomial order, as well as its graded character formula.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The shape of a number field $K$ of degree $n$ is defined as the equivalence class of the lattice of integers under linear operations generated by rotations, reflections, and positive scalar dilations. It may be viewed as a point in the space of shapes $\mathscr{S}_{n-1} = \mathrm{GL}_{n-1}(\mathbb{Z})\backslash \mathrm{GL}_{n-1}(\mathbb{R})/\mathrm{GO}_{n-1}(\mathbb{R})$. In this paper, we study the distribution of shapes of octic Kummer extensions $L=\mathbb{Q}(i,\sqrt[4]{m})$, where $m\in\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is fourth-power-free. We parametrize these shapes by explicit invariants known as shape parameters and establish an asymptotic formula for their joint distribution ordered by absolute discriminant. The limiting distribution is given by an explicit measure that factors as the product of a continuous measure and a discrete measure arising from local arithmetic conditions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study properties of typical closed geodesics on expander surfaces of high genus, i.e. closed hyperbolic surfaces with a uniform spectral gap of the Laplacian. Under an additional systole lower bound assumption, we show almost every geodesic of length much greater than $\sqrt{g}\log g$ is non-simple. And we prove almost every closed geodesic of length much greater than $g (\log g)^2$ is filling, i.e. each component of the complement of the geodesic is a topological disc. Our results apply to Weil-Petersson random surfaces, random covers of a fixed surface, and Brooks-Makover random surfaces, since these models are known to have uniform spectral gap asymptotically almost surely. Our proof technique involves adapting Margulis' counting strategy to work at low length scales.</p></details>

We term this the \emph{HOMFLYPT difference module}, which captures relations between the colored HOMFLYPT polynomials of different antisymmetric colorings.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a reductive group over a non-archimedean local field $F$ of residue characteristic $p$. We consider pairs $(φ,I)$ consisting of a "wild inertia" Langlands parameter $φ: P_F \longrightarrow \hat{G}$ whose centralizer $C_{\hat{G}}(φ)$ is a Levi subgroup of $\hat{G}$, and a cohomological invariant $I$ whose definition is inspired by the theory of endoscopy. Assuming that $p$ is odd and not a torsion prime of $G$ nor of $\hat{G}$, we associate to each such pair $(φ,I)$ a Serre subcategory $\mathrm{Rep}^{φ,I}(G(F))$ of the category of smooth $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}[\frac{1}{p}]$-representations of $G(F)$. Then we construct an equivalence between this Serre subcategory and the category of depth-zero $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}[\frac{1}{p}]$-representations of a twisted Levi subgroup $G_{φ,I}$ of $G$, which is dual to $C_{\hat{G}}(φ)$. This pattern for reduction to depth zero fits well with the conjectural (categorical) local Langlands correspondence. When $G$ is tamely ramified and $p$ does not divide the order of its Weyl group, then the above Serre subcategories provide the block decomposition of the category of all smooth $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}[\frac{1}{p}]$-representations of $G(F)$. In this case, we thus obtain a reduction-to-depth-zero process for smooth representations of $G(F)$ valued in any algebraically closed field of characteristic different from $p$. When that field has characteristic 0, this recovers some of the recent results of Adler--Fintzen--Mishra--Ohara. When that field is $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_{\ell}$, we use our results together with Zhu's unipotent categorical correspondence to produce a fully faithful embedding of $D\mathrm{Rep}_{\overline{\mathbb{F}}_{\ell}}(\mathrm{GL}_{n}(F))$ into a suitable category of coherent sheaves on the moduli space of $n$-dimensional $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_{\ell}$-representations of the Weil group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Hecke operators acting on modular functions arise naturally in the context of 2d conformal field theory, but in seemingly disparate areas, including permutation orbifold theories, ensembles of code CFTs, and more recently in the context of the AdS$_3$/RMT$_2$ program. We use an equidistribution theorem for Hecke operators to show that in each of these large $N$ limits, an entire heavy sector of the partition function gets integrated out, leaving only contributions from Poincaré series of light states. This gives an immediate holographic interpretation as a sum over semiclassical handlebody geometries. We speculate on further physical interpretations for equidistribution, including a potential ergodicity statement.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article we study the Ekedahl-Oort types of $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-Galois covers $π:Y \to X$ in characteristic two. When the base curve $X$ is ordinary, we show that the Ekedahl-Oort type of $Y$ is completely determined by the genus of $X$ and the ramification of $π$. For a general base curve $X$, we prove bounds on the Ekedahl-Oort depending on the Ekedahl-Oort type of $X$ and the ramification of $π$. Along the way, we develop a theory of \emph{enhanced differentials of the second kind}. This theory allows us to study algebraic de Rham cohomology in any characteristic by working directly with differentials, in contrast to the standard Čech resolution.</p></details>

Our study also allows us to correct a result of Broué, Malle, Rouquier on projective reflection groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In his proof of the K(pi,1) conjecture for complex reflection arrangements, Bessis defined Garside categories suitable for studying braid groups of centralizers of Springer regular elements in well-generated complex reflection groups. We provide a detailed study of these categories, which we call Springer categories. We describe in particular the conjugacy of braided reflections of regular centralizer in terms of the Garside structure of the associated Springer category. In so doing we obtain a pure Garside theoretic proof of a theorem of Digne, Marin and Michel on the center of finite index subgroups in complex braid groups in the case of a regular centralizer in a well-generated group. We also provide a "Hurwitz-like" presentation of Springer categories. To this aim we provide additional insights on noncrossing partitions in the infinite series. Lastly, we use this "Hurwitz-like" presentation, along with a generalized Reidemeister-Schreier method we introduce for groupoids, to deduce nice presentations of the complex braid group B(G31).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We calculate the Dehn twist action on the spaces of conformal blocks of a not necessarily semisimple modular category. In particular, we give the order of the Dehn twists under the mapping class group representations of closed surfaces. For Dehn twists about non-separating simple closed curves, we prove that this order is the order of the ribbon twist, thereby generalizing a result that De Renzi-Gainutdinov-Geer-Patureau-Mirand-Runkel obtained for the small quantum group. In the separating case, we express the order using the order of the ribbon twist on monoidal powers of the canonical end. As an application, we prove that the Johnson kernels of the mapping class groups act trivially if and only if for the canonical end the ribbon twist and double braiding with itself are trivial. We give a similar result for the visibility of the Torelli groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a smooth algebraic curve defined over a number field, one can associate a bipartite graph known as a dessin d'enfant. In this paper, we investigate the regularity and automorphism groups of dessins d'enfants with uniform passports, that is, those for which the valencies of black vertices, white vertices, and faces are constant, and study how these properties depend on the genus. Although uniformity imposes a high degree of symmetry, such dessins are not necessarily regular. Our main results are as follows: (1) A passport of the form $[a^{p}, b^{q}, n]$ (the tree case) admits a regular dessin if and only if $\gcd(p,q)=1$. (2) Every passport of the form $[n, b^{q}, n]$ of genus at least 2 admits a dessin with a trivial automorphism group. In addition, we obtain several results on uniform passports of genus 0 and 1. We also establish two theorems on the enumeration of elements in symmetric groups, which are useful for the study of automorphism groups of dessins.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Correction of minor typos and issue with cleveref package

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this series of papers, we investigate properties of a finite group which are determined by its low degree irreducible representations over a number field $F$, i.e. its representations on matrix rings $\mathrm{M}_n(D)$ with $n \leq 2$. In particular we focus on representations on $\mathrm{M}_2(D)$ where $D$ is a division algebra having an order $\mathcal{O}$ such that $\mathcal{O}$ has finitely many units, i.e. such that $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathcal{O})$ has arithmetic rank $1$. In this first part, the focus is on two aspects. One aspect concerns characterisations of such representing spaces in terms of Serre's homological goodness property, small virtual cohomological dimension and higher Kleinian-type embeddings. As an application, we obtain several characterisations of the finite groups $G$ whose irreducible representations are of the mentioned form. In particular, such groups $G$ are precisely those such that $\mathcal{U}(R G)$, with $R$ the ring of integers of $F$, can be constructed from groups which virtually map onto a non-abelian free group. Along the way we investigate the latter property for congruence subgroups of higher modular groups and its implications for the congruence kernel. This is used to obtain new information on the congruence kernel of the unit group of a group ring. The second aspect concerns the conjugacy classes of the images of finite subgroups of $\mathcal{U}(R G)$ under the irreducible representations of $G$. More precisely, we initiate the study of a blockwise variant of the Zassenhaus conjectures and the subgroup isomorphism problem. Moreover, we contribute to them for the low rank representations above.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the space of Belyi maps admits a natural parametrization by an infinite-dimensional sphere arising from Voiculescu's theory of noncommutative probability spaces. We show that this sphere decomposes into sectors, each of which corresponds to a class of Belyi maps distinguished up to isomorphism by their monodromy, encoded by a finite-index subgroup of F2. For Galois Belyi maps, our correspondence between spectral sectors of the infinite sphere and algebraic quotients of F2 yields a genuine bijection. Within this framework, distinct sectors of the sphere capture the algebraic constraints imposed on the monodromy, thereby providing a geometric organization of Belyi maps according to their associated group-theoretic data.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>An ideal setting to exhibit infinite sets of primes $p$ relative to which an integer is a primitive root $\pmod p$ is provided by the Bézout subdomain $\widetilde{\mathbb{B}}:=\mathbb{Z}^{\mathbb{P}}/\mathfrak{U}$ of the valuation domain $\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}=\prod_{\mathfrak{U}} \mathbb{Z}_p$ with respect to a nonprincipal ultrafilter $\mathfrak{U}$ on $\mathbb{P}$, extant via Chebotarev's theorem and the ultrafilter theorem and such that the relative algebraic closure $\mathbb{L}:=\mathrm{Abs}(\widetilde{\mathbb{Q}})$ of the prime field of the valued field $\widetilde{\mathbb{Q}}=\prod_{\mathfrak{U}} \mathbb{Q}_p$ contains $\sqrt{-\tilde p}$ for $p\in\mathbb{P}$, contains no $\sqrt[3]{\tilde q}$ for $q\in\mathbb{P}$, and has $\mathrm{tor}(\mathbb{L}^\times)=\langle ζ_6\rangle$. Results include positive resolutions of the conjectured infinitude of primes $p$ for which (i) $\frac{p-1}{6}$ is prime and (ii) a non-perfect-square $-1\neq m\in\mathbb{Z}$ is a primitive root $\pmod p$, establishing as manifest the efficacy of ultraproduct treatments in resolving number theory problems requiring certification of countably infinite conforming sets. Furthermore, we extend these results to the quantitative regime by identifying the primitive-root indicator as a projection in the $C^\ast$-algebra $\ell^\infty(\mathbb{P})$. We prove that the Bézout rigidity of $\widetilde{\mathbb{B}}$ and the $\mathbf{\tildeν}$-anchor enforce the normality of the density state, thereby algebraically precluding ``spectral leakage'' into the infinite tail of Kummer obstructions. This provides a structural, GRH-free proof that the natural density exists as the vacuum expectation value in a GNS representation: $δ_m=ω_δ(f_m)= c_m\prod_{q\in\mathbb{P}}(1-\frac{1}{q(q-1)})$ where $\prod_{q\in\mathbb{P}}(1-\frac{1}{q(q-1)})$ is the Artin Euler product.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove functional equations for multiple Dirichlet series defined by a collection of five geometric axioms. We find functional equations of two types: one modeled on the functional equations of Dirichlet $L$-functions, and another modeled on the functional equations of Kubota $L$-series with Gauss sums as coefficients. These functional equations generate groupoid structures, which we relate to the Weyl groupoids of arithmetic root systems. From the known classification of arithmetic root systems, we obtain a complete classification of multiple Dirichlet series which can be used to compute moments of $L$-functions via established analytic techniques. Our classification includes all moments of $L$-functions which have appeared in the multiple Dirichlet series literature previously, alongside some new moments. Finally, we give applications of our functional equations to quantum algebra, specifically the cohomology of Nichols algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Drinfeld's degenerate affine analog of Schur-Weyl duality relates representations of the degenerate affine Hecke algebra $AH_r$ to representations of the Yangian $Y_n$. One way to understand the construction is to introduce an intermediate algebra $AS(n,r)$, the degenerate affine Schur algebra, which appears both as the endomorphism algebra of an induced tensor space over $AH_r$, and as the image of a homomorphism $D_{n,r}:Y_n \rightarrow AS(n,r)$. In this paper, we describe $D_{n,r}$ using a diagrammatic calculus. Then we use a theorem of Drinfeld to compute $\ker D_{n,r}$ when $n > r$, thereby giving a presentation of $AS(n,r)$ in these cases. We formulate a conjecture in the remaining cases. Finally, we apply results of Arakawa to develop some of the representation theory of $AS(n,r)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a prime $p\equiv 1 \,(\bmod{4})$, let $$ \varepsilon = \frac{1}{2}\left( t + u\sqrt{p}\right) $$ be the fundamental unit of the real quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p})$. In 1951, N. Ankeny, E. Artin, and S. Chowla asked whether $p$ can divide $u$. They suggested that this can never happen and this has since been called the Ankeny--Artin--Chowla (AAC) conjecture. We show that if $\mathfrak{p}$ is the prime above $p$ in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p})$, then the AAC conjecture is false if and only if $$ \varepsilon^{p-1} \equiv 1\, (\bmod{\mathfrak{p}^2}). $$ Thus, the AAC conjecture is related to the existence of number field analogues of Wieferich primes. Therefore, in the second part of this paper, we investigate the infinitude of Wieferich primes in number fields. Subject to Masser's $abc$-conjecture for number fields, we prove that for any fixed $α\in \mathcal{O}_K\setminus\{0\}$ that is not a root of unity, there are infinitely many primes ideals $\mathfrak{p}\subseteq \mathcal{O}_K$ for which $$ α^{N(\mathfrak{p})-1} \not\equiv 1\, (\bmod{\mathfrak{p}^2}). $$ Additionally, we show under the weaker assumption that there are finitely many base-$α$ super-Wieferich primes, and that there are infinitely many base-$α$ non-Wieferich primes. In both cases, we obtain the lower bound $$ \#\left\{\text{prime ideals } \mathfrak{p} : N(\mathfrak{p})\leq x \text{ and } α^{N(\mathfrak{p})-1}\not\equiv 1 \,(\bmod{\mathfrak{p}^2})\right\} \gg_{K, α, \varepsilon} \frac{\log x}{\log\log x} $$ as $x\to \infty$.</p></details>

We prove that for $p<3000$ such an $f$ of degree $d>1$ must be isomorphic to the quotient map $X_0(p)\to X_0^+(p)$. Supported by computational and theoretical evidence, we also conjecture that this is true for all primes $p$. These results allow us to classify all points of degree $\leq 25$ on $X_0(p)$ that come from a map to some curve of genus $\geq 2$. As an application, we were able to determine all curves $X_0(p)$ with infinitely many points of degree $6$ over $\mathbb Q$ except for $p=193$, continuing the previous results on small degree points on $X_0(N)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We examine the cell modules for the category of type An webs and their natural cellular forms. We modify the bases of these modules, as described by Elias, to obtain an orthogonal basis of each cell module. Hence, we calculate the determinant of the Gram matrix with respect to such bases. These Gram determinants are given in terms of intersection forms, computed from certain traces of clasps - higher order Jones-Wenzl morphisms. Additionally, the modified basis is constructed using these clasps, and each clasp is constructed using traces of smaller clasps. Elias conjectures a value for these intersection forms and verifies it in types $A_1$, $A_2$ and $A_3$. This paper concludes with a proof of the conjecture in type $A_n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Many modern learning tasks require models that can take inputs of varying sizes. Consequently, dimension-independent architectures have been proposed for domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design principles for designing new transferable models. Numerical experiments support our findings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\varphi$ be the Hörmander--Bernhardsson extremal function, and let $(\pmτ_n)_{n\ge1}$ be its real zeros. Using the recent analytic description of the zero set ${τ_n}$, we prove that the squared zeros $λ_n=τ_n^{2}$ form an admissible sequence in the sense of Quine--Heydari--Song: the heat trace $Θ(t)=\sum_{n\ge1}e^{-λ_n t}$ has a full $t\to0^{+}$ expansion in pure powers of $t^{1/2}$. The proof is based on an analytic normal form $$ λ_n=\Bigl(n+\tfrac12\Bigr)^2+q!\Bigl(\Bigl(n+\tfrac12\Bigr)^{-2}\Bigr), $$ a uniform Taylor expansion in $t$, and a Mellin--Hurwitz zeta analysis of the resulting weighted Gaussian sums. As applications we obtain meromorphic continuation and special-value information for the associated spectral zeta function and zeta-regularized product, sharp large-parameter asymptotics for the canonical product $\prod_{n}(1+z/λ_n)$. In particular, we deduce the conjecture by Bondarenko--Ortega-Cerdà--Radchenko--Seip for the special values of the Dirichlet-type series attached to $\varphi$. We also establish a parity dichotomy: sequences $(τ_n^m)$ are QHS--admissible for even $m$, while for odd $m$ a nonzero $t\log t$ term obstructs admissibility.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Alpöge--Bhargava--Shnidman showed that even a strengthened \emph{no local obstruction} condition for monogenicity does not force a global power integral basis: in the full spaces of cubic and quartic fields, a positive proportion are non-monogenic yet satisfy this ABS fixed-sign condition. This raises a natural family-level question: does the same phenomenon persist inside one-parameter families, where the local structure varies in a highly constrained way? In this paper we answer this in the negative for the pure fields $K_m=\mathbb Q(α)$ with $α^n=m$ ($n\ge 4$) and $m$ square-free. Writing $g(m)=[\mathcal O_{K_m}:\mathbb Z[α]]$, we prove that the set of square-free $m$ for which $g(m)>1$ but $K_m$ has no ABS local obstruction has natural density $0$. Consequently, in the pure family monogenicity and $α$--monogenicity have the same natural density. The proof isolates a reusable mechanism, which we call the Eisenstein-prime obstruction sieve. The argument is packaged in an abstract template and transfers to other Eisenstein parameter families.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the index of nilpotency relative to certain Hecke operators in spaces of modular forms with integer weight and level $N$ with integer coefficients modulo primes $p$ for $(p, N) \in \{(3, 1), (5, 1), (7, 1), (3, 4)\}$. In these settings, we prove upper bounds on certain indices of nilpotency. As an application of our bounds, we prove infinite families of congruences for $p^t$-core partition functions modulo $p$ for $p\in \{3, 5, 7\}$ and $t\geq 1$, and we prove an infinite family of congruences modulo $3$ for the $r$th power partition function, $p_r(n)$, when $r = 12k$ with $\gcd(k,6) = 1$. We also include conjectures on a function which quantifies degree lowering on powers of the Delta function by the relevant Hecke operators in these settings, and on the index of nilpotency relative to a modification of this degree-lowering function.</p></details>
