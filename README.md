### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17791v1'>2510.17791</a>\]&nbsp; **Rational Points on a Family of Genus 3 Hyperelliptic Curves**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Roberto Hernandez &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the rational points on certain members of the following family of hyperelliptic curves $$C_a \colon y^2 = x^8 + (4-4a^4) x^6 + (8a^4 + 6)x^4 + (4-4a^4)x^2 + 1$$ via the method first developed by Dem'yanenko \cite{dem1966rational} and then further generalized by Manin \cite{manin1969p}. In particular, we show that the method of Chabauty--Coleman, while applicable to certain members of this family, is not the most efficient way of computing $C_a(\mathbb{Q})$. We adapt the approach of \cite{kulesz1999application}, incorporating root numbers to further restrict the possible ranks of the elliptic curves arising in the Jacobian decomposition.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The "pyjama stripe" with parameter $\varepsilon>0$ is the set $E(\varepsilon)$ of all complex numbers $z$ such that the distance from $\Re(z)$ to the nearest integer is at most $\varepsilon$. The Pyjama Problem of Iosevich, Kolountzakis, and Matolcsi asks whether, for every choice of $\varepsilon>0$, it is possible to cover the entire complex plane with finitely many rotations of $E(\varepsilon)$ around the origin. Manners obtained an affirmative answer to this question by studying a $\times 2, \times 3$-type problem over a suitable solenoid. Manners's argument provided no quantitative bounds (in terms of $\varepsilon$) on the number of rotations required, and Green has highlighted the problem of obtaining such quantitative bounds. Our main result is that $\exp\exp\exp(\varepsilon^{-O(1)})$ rotations of $E(\varepsilon)$ suffice to cover the complex plane. Our analysis makes use of the entropic tools developed by Bourgain, Lindenstrauss, Michel, and Venkatesh for quantitative $\times 2, \times 3$-type results.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, we study real numbers $x$ for which $p(x)$ is (absolutely) normal for every non-constant integer-valued polynomial $p$. We call such numbers transcendentally normal. We prove that almost every real number is transcendentally normal and provide an explicit construction of such a number, based on Sierpinski's covering method and novel ideas involving the so-called stretch function. In the next step, we transform this construction into an algorithm that computes the digits of a t-normal number recursively in all integer bases. Moreover, we extend our covering approach to construct and compute LIL-normal numbers whose discrepancies are of the order predicted by the law of the iterated logarithm. We also take the opportunity to discuss several interesting open problems.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 9 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Based on recent successes concerning permutation resolutions of representations by Balmer and Gallauer we define a new invariant of finite groups: the p-permutation dimension. We define this analogously to the global dimension of a ring by replacing projective resolutions of ring modules with resolutions by p-permutation modules of modules over the group ring. We compute this invariant for cyclic groups of prime order.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 13 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using geometric methods, we show that for any squarefree polynomial $f \in \mathbb{F}_q[t]$ of degree $n \ge 2$, every residue class modulo $f$ can be represented as a product of two monic irreducible polynomials of degree at most $n$, provided $q$ is sufficiently large in terms of $n$. This proves the function field analogue of a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s in the large $q$ regime.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 41 pages. Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a split Kac-Moody group over a non-Archimedean local field, and let $\mathcal{H}$ be the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of $G$. In this paper, we construct a completed Iwahori-Hecke algebra $\widehat{\mathcal{H}}$ and prove that it contains a large center isomorphic to Looijenga's invariant ring. By the Kac-Moody Satake isomorphism, Looijenga's invariant ring is isomorphic to the spherical Hecke algebra. Our completion is constructed by considering Iwahori biinvariant functions on $G$ satisfying a support condition that we call Weyl almost finite support. We contrast our construction with another completion $\widetilde{\mathcal{H}}$, defined early by Abdellatif and H\'ebert, which is defined algebraically via the Bernstein-Lusztig presentation and not in terms of functions on $G$.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02607v2'>2508.02607</a>\]&nbsp; **On a multiplicative non-Hecke twist of motivic L-functions**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Heiko Knospe, Andrzej Dąbrowski &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 15 pages, 3 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the twisting of motivic $L$-functions by a family of multiplicative characters $\psi$, defined on prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}$ via $\psi(\mathfrak{p})=\alpha^{N(\mathfrak{p})}$ for a fixed $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$. One can extend $\psi$ to a continuous non-Hecke character on the idele group of a number field. For $|\alpha|<1$, the resulting $\psi$-twisted $L$-function has interesting analytic properties: an enhanced half-plane of absolute convergence, preservation of the Euler product structure, and meromorphic continuation to the complex plane. We give applications to Dirichlet $L$-functions and $L$-functions associated to modular forms. Furthermore, we show that $\psi$-twisting allows the construction of convergent $p$-adic Dirichlet series and $p$-adic Euler products which have some similarities with their complex counterparts.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that for any polynomial $F(X,Y_0,Y_1,Y_2) \in \mathbb{C}[X, Y_0, Y_1, Y_2]$, the equation $F(z,j(z),j'(z),j''(z))=0$ has a Zariski dense set of solutions in the hypersurface $F(X,Y_0,Y_1,Y_2)=0$, unless $F$ is in $\mathbb{C}[X]$ or it is divisible by $Y_0$, $Y_0-1728$, or $Y_1$. Our methods establish criteria for finding solutions to more general equations involving periodic functions. Furthermore, they produce a qualitative description of the distribution of these solutions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages; v3: revision adding section on Brauer groups and details for motivation and on Witt rings; minor corrections and clarifications throughout

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E$ be a totally real number field of degree $d$ and let $m \geqslant 3$ be an integer. We show that if $md \leqslant 21$ then there exists an $(m-2)$-dimensional family of complex projective $K3$ surfaces with real multiplication by $E$. Analogous results are proved for CM number fields and also for all known higher-dimensional hyperk\"ahler manifolds.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17298v1'>2510.17298</a>\]&nbsp; **Hopf BiGalois Theory for Hopf Algebroids**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Xiao Han, Peter Schauenburg &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a theory of Hopf BiGalois extensions for Hopf algebroids. We understand these to be left bialgebroids (whose left module categories are monoidal categories) fulfilling a condition that is equivalent to being Hopf in the case of ordinary bialgebras, but does not entail the existence of an antipode map. The immediate obstacle to developing a full biGalois theory for such Hopf algebroids is simple: The condition to be a left Hopf Galois extension can be defined in complete analogy to the Hopf case, but the Galois map for a right comodule algebra is not a well defined map. We find that this obstacle can be circumvented using bialgebroids fulfilling a condition that still does not entail the existence of an antipode, but is equivalent, for ordinary bialgebras, to being Hopf with bijective antipode. The key technical tool is a result of Chemla allowing to switch left and right comodule structures under flatness conditions much like one would do using an antipode. Using this, we arrive at a left-right symmetric theory of biGalois extensions, including the construction of an Ehresmann Hopf algebroid making a one-sided Hopf-Galois extension into a biGalois one. Moreover, we apply a more general 2-cocycle twist theory to Ehresmann Hopf algebroids. As the 2-cocycle is only left linear over the base, the base algebra is also twisted. We also study the Ehresmann Hopf algebroids of quantum Hopf fibrations and quantum homogeneous space as examples.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the existence of a sequence of commutative diagrams generalizing existing results on the cohomology of the Borel-Serre boundary and well-rounded retract to the context of the well-tempered complex. Our main theorem provides a method for computing in finite terms the action of Hecke operators on the equivariant cohomology of an arithmetic subgroup $\Gamma$ of the special linear group $SL_n$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-20 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Maarten Solleveld &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is a survey paper about representation theory and noncommutative geometry of reductive p-adic groups G. The main focus points are: 1. The structure of the Hecke algebra H(G), the Harish-Chandra-Schwartz algebra S(G) and the reduced C*-algebra $C_r^* (G)$. 2. The classification of irreducible G-representations in terms of supercuspidal representations. 3. The Hochschild homology and topological K-theory of these algebras. In the final part we prove one new result, namely we compute $K_* (C_r^* (G))$ including torsion elements, in terms of equivariant K-theory of compact tori.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages, 2 figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\xi$ be a real number and $b \ge 2$ an integer. We study the relationship between the irrationality exponent of $\xi$ and the subword complexity $p(n, \bfx)$ of the $b$-ary expansion $\bfx$ of $\xi$, where $p(n, \bfx)$ counts the number of distinct blocks of length $n$ in $\bfx$, for $n \ge 1$. If the irrationality exponent of $\xi$ is equal to $2$, which is the case for almost all real numbers $\xi$, we show that the limit superior of the sequence $(p(n, \bfx) / n)_{n \ge 1}$ is at least equal to 4/3. The proof is based on a careful study of the evolution of the Rauzy graphs of infinite words of low complexity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this note, we define the Burnside ring of a monoid, generalizing the construction for groups. After giving foundational definitions, we characterize transitive M-sets and their automorphisms, then prove a structure theorem for a broad class of monoids that allows us to write the Burnside ring as a direct product of Burnside rings of groups. Finally, we define a monoid correlate of the table of marks, and show that the Burnside algebra over the rationals is semisimple.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the modular resolution method using a new tool called a polyserie, introduced by Prof. Wildberger N.J. \& Rubine D. in their recent article \cite{wildberger2025hyper}. In the present article we try to prove an equivalence theorem of the existence and the uniqueness of the solutions of the modular quadratic equations of the form: \begin{equation*} x^{2}+a.x+u\equiv 0\text{ }\left( \mathrm{mod}\text{ }u^{n}\right) , \end{equation*}% by using the same recurrence formula introduced in \cite{wildberger2025hyper} between the Catalan sequence terms: \begin{equation*} C_{n+1}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}C_{k}.C_{n-k,} \end{equation*}% and by introducing the following notions: Wildberger's polynumber sequences (polynomials), binomial Chu-Vandermonde identity, truncated polyseries and finally modular resolution as application.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the representations of rational numbers via continued fraction, Egyptian fraction, and Engel fraction expansions. Given $m \in \mathbb{N}$, denote by $C_m, E_m, E_m^*$ the sets of rational numbers whose continued fraction, Egyptian fraction, and Engel fraction expansions have length $m$, respectively. We establish the Minkowski dimensions of these sets and apply the results to analyze the phase transition phenomenon and sumset-type problems for decreasing sequences.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 22 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\psi:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_+$ be a monotonically non-increasing function, and let $\psi_v:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_+$ be defined by $\psi_v(q)=1/q^v$. In this article, we consider self-similar sets whose iterated function systems satisfy the open set condition. For functions $\psi$ that do not decrease too rapidly, we give a conjecturally sharp upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection of $\psi$-well approximable numbers and such self-similar sets. When $\psi=\psi_v$ for some $v$ greater than 1 and sufficiently close to $1$, we give a lower bound for this Hausdorff dimension, which asymptotically matches the upper bound as $v\downarrow 1$. In particular, we show that the set of very well approximable numbers has full Hausdorff dimension within self-similar sets, thus confirming a conjecture of Levesley, Salp, and Velani.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of a bounded weight function on a language, and show that the set of bounded weight functions on a regular language is a rational polyhedral cone. We study the cell recognised by a bounded weight function (that is, the set of elements of the language where the bound is attained), and show that if the language is regular then this cell is regular. The related notion of a weight function on a finitely generated group is introduced, and the case of Coxeter groups is studied in detail. Applications to the representation theory of weighted Hecke algebras are given.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the $M$-functions, which describe the limit theorem for the value-distributions of the secondary main terms in the asymptotic formulas for the summatory functions of the Goldbach counting function. One of the new aspects is a sufficient condition for the Riemann hypothesis provided by some formulas of the $M$-functions, which was a necessary condition in previous work. The other new aspect is the relation between the secondary main terms and the screw functions, which provides another necessary and sufficient condition for the Riemann hypothesis. We study such $M$-functions and screw functions in generalized settings by axiomatizing them.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give first-order definitions of Campana and Darmon points in algebraic function fields in one variable over number fields. These sets are geometric generalizations of $n$-full integers (integers whose nonzero valuations are at least $n$) and perfect $n$th powers, respectively, to more general algebraic varieties. For this we exploit the theory of quadratic Pfister forms, which were used by Becher, Daans & Dittmann to extend to the case of algebraic function fields in one variable the methods used by Koenigsmann when proving that $\mathbb{Z}$ is universally defined in $\mathbb{Q}$. These methods had already been generalized to arbitrary global fields by Park (2013) and Eisentr\"ager & Morrison (2018), and the author had already exploited these methods to find first-order definitions of Campana points (2024) and Darmon points (2024, with Handley) in the context of number fields. With the newly expanded version of these methods, we now transfer those results to the new context of algebraic function fields in one variable over number fields.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we construct an arithmetic hyperbolic $6-$orbifold $\mathcal{O}$ such that, any square-rootable Salem number of degree at most $4$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is realized as the exponential of the length of a closed geodesic in $\mathcal{O}$. We also prove that $n=6$ is the minimal dimension among arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds of the first type where it can be obtained. In an appendix, we establish a general relation between the discriminant of a Salem number and the determinant of a quadratic space which realizes it. In particular, for any $m,d>0$ we present a geometric proof of the existence of Salem numbers of degree $2m$ with discriminant $(-1)^{m+1}d$ in $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}/\mathbb{Q}^{\times 2}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study the category of localizing motives $\mathrm{Mot}^{\mathrm{loc}}$ -- the target of the universal finitary localizing invariant of idempotent-complete stable categories as defined by Blumberg-Gepner-Tabuada. We prove that this (presentable stable) category is rigid symmetric monoidal in the sense of Gaitsgory and Rozenblyum. In particular, it is dualizable. More precisely, we prove a more general version of this result for the category $\mathrm{Mot}^{\mathrm{loc}}_{\mathcal{E}}$ -- the target of the universal finitary localizing invariant of dualizable modules over a rigid symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{E}.$ We obtain general results on morphisms and internal $\mathrm{Hom}$ in the categories $\mathrm{Mot}^{\mathrm{loc}}_{\mathcal{E}}$ of localizing motives. As an application we compute the morphisms in multiple non-trivial examples. In particular, we prove the corepresentability statements for $\mathrm{TR}$ (topological restriction) and $\mathrm{TC}$ (topological cyclic homology) when restricted to connective $\mathbb{E}_1$-rings. As a corollary, for a connective $\mathbb{E}_{\infty}$-ring $R$ we obtain a $\mathrm{TR}(R)$-module structure on the nil $K$-theory spectrum $NK(R).$ We also apply the rigidity theorem to define refined versions of negative cyclic homology and periodic cyclic homology. This was announced previously in \cite{E24b}, and certain very interesting examples were computed by Meyer and Wagner in \cite{MW24}. Here we do several computations in characteristic $0,$ in particular showing that in seemingly innocuous situations the answer can be given by an interesting algebra of overconvergent functions.</p></details>

By letting $L$ and $M$ tend to infinity, we get the 1993 Alladi-Gordon $q$-hypergeometric key-identity for the generalized Schur Theorem as well as the fundamental Lebesgue identity by two different choices of the variables. This polynomial identity provides a generalization and a unified approach to the Schur and Lebesgue theorems. We discuss other analytic identities for the Lebesgue and Schur theorems and also provide a key identity ($q$-hypergeometric) for Andrews' deep refinement of the Alladi-Schur theorem. Finally, we discuss a new infinite hierarchy of identities, the first three of which relate to the partition theorems of Euler, Lebesgue, and Capparelli, and provide their polynomial versions as well.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We explain how the geometric framework introduced in arXiv:2508.11621 [math.AG] provides a universal property for the 2-rings of perfect complexes on qcqs spectral or Dirac spectral schemes. As an application, given a qcqs spectral or Dirac spectral scheme $X$ this produces a comparison morphism from $\mathrm{Spec} \mathrm{Perf}_{X}$ to $X$ itself, which is moreover natural in $X$. When $X$ is an ordinary qcqs scheme, this construction supplies a new proof of the Balmer-Thomason reconstruction of $X$ from its space of thick subcategories, assuming the result for noetherian rings due to Neeman. As another application, we find spectral and Dirac spectral enhancements of support varieties arising for 2-rings in representation theory which "geometrize" the 2-rings that produce them. For example, given a finite group $G$ over a field $k$, this produces a "spectral support variety" $\mathcal{V}_{G}$ such that $\mathrm{Perf}_{\mathcal{V}_{G}}$ maps into the stable module category of $kG$. We derive these results as a corollary of a general affineness criterion for 2-schemes which are covered by the Zariski spectra of rigid 2-rings: this states that such 2-schemes are affine if and only if they are quasicompact and quasiseparated.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $d \ge 2$ be an integer, $K$ an algebraically closed field such that $char(K)$ does not divide $d$, $n > d$ an integer prime to $d$, $f(x)$ a degree $n$ monic polynomial with coefficients in $K$ and without repeated roots, and $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ a smooth projective model of the affine curve $y^d=f(x)$. Let $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$ be the Jacobian of $\mathcal{C}_{f,d} $. We identify $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ with its canonical image in $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$ (such that the infinite point of $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ goes to the zero of the group law on $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$). We say that an integer $m>1$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K$ if there exists a polynomial $f(x)$ as above such that $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}(K)$ contains a torsion point of order $m$. Earlier we proved that if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable, then either $m=d$ or $m \geq n$ (in addition, both $d$ and $n$ are $(n,d)$-reachable). In the present paper we prove the following. If $n<m<2n$ and if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K$, then either $d|m$ or $m$ is congruent to $n$ modulo $d$. If $char(K)$ is $0$ or $>n$, then $d [(n+d)/d]$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if and only if $n-(d-1) [(n+d)/d]\ge 0$. If $char(K)=0$, then $n+d$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if and only if $d^2-2d<n$. If $d=2$ (the hyperelliptic case) and $char(K)=0$, then $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if $n+1 \le m \le 2n+1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the phenomenon known as ``quantum equals affine'' in the setting of $T$-equivariant quantum $K$-theory of the flag variety $G/B$, as established by Kato for any semisimple algebraic group $G$. In particular, we focus on the $K$-Peterson isomorphism between the $T$-equivariant quantum $K$-ring $QK_T(SL_n(\mathbb{C})/B)$ and the $T$-equivariant $K$-homology ring $K_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_{SL_n})$ of the affine Grassmannian, after suitable localizations on both sides. Building on an earlier work by Ikeda, Iwao, and Maeno, we present an explicit algebraic realization of the $K$-Peterson map via a rational substitution that sends the generators of the quantum $K$-theory ring to explicit rational expressions in the fundamental generators of $K_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_{SL_n})$, thereby matching the Schubert bases on both sides. Our approach builds on recent developments in the theory of $QK_T(SL_n(\mathbb{C})/B)$ by Maeno, Naito, and Sagaki, as well as the theory of $K$-theoretic double $k$-Schur functions introduced by Ikeda, Shimozono, and Yamaguchi. This concrete formulation provides new insight into the combinatorial structure of the $K$-Peterson isomorphism in the equivariant setting. As an application, we establish a factorization formula for the $K$-theoretic double $k$-Schur function associated with the maximal $k$-irreducible $k$-bounded partition.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Witt algebra W_n is the Lie algebra of all derivations of the n-variable polynomial ring V_n=C[x_1, ..., x_n] (or of algebraic vector fields on A^n). A representation of W_n is polynomial if it arises as a subquotient of a sum of tensor powers of V_n. Our main theorems assert that finitely generated polynomial representations of W_n are noetherian and have rational Hilbert series. A key intermediate result states polynomial representations of the infinite Witt algebra are equivalent to representations of Fin^op, where Fin is the category of finite sets. We also show that polynomial representations of W_n are equivalent to polynomial representations of the endomorphism monoid of A^n. These equivalences are a special case of an operadic version of Schur--Weyl duality, which we establish.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a commutative algebra in a braided monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$; e.g., $A$ could be an extension of a vertex operator algebra (VOA) $V$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ of $V$-modules. We study when the category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ and its subcategory $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ of local modules inherit rigidity from $\mathcal{C}$, and then we find conditions for $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{C}_A$ to inherit rigidity from $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$. First, we assume $\mathcal{C}$ is a braided finite tensor category and prove rigidity of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ under conditions based on criteria of Etingof-Ostrik for $A$ to be an exact algebra in $\mathcal{C}$. As a corollary, we show that if $A$ is a simple $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$-graded VOA with a strongly rational vertex operator subalgebra $V$, then $A$ is strongly rational, without requiring the categorical dimension of $A$ as a $V$-module to be non-zero. Next, we assume $\mathcal{C}$ is a Grothendieck-Verdier category, i.e., $\mathcal{C}$ admits a weaker duality structure than rigidity. We first prove $\mathcal{C}_A$ is also a Grothendieck-Verdier category. Using this, we prove that if $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ is rigid, then so is $\mathcal{C}$ under conditions such as a mild non-degeneracy assumption on $\mathcal{C}$, an assumption that every simple object of $\mathcal{C}_A$ is local, and that induction from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{C}_A$ commutes with duality. These conditions are motivated by free field-like VOA extensions $V\subseteq A$ where $A$ is often an indecomposable $V$-module, so our result will make it more feasible to prove rigidity for many vertex algebraic monoidal categories. In a follow-up work, our result will be used to prove rigidity of the category of weight modules for the simple affine VOA of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at any admissible level.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the set of $D$ such that a given irreducible hypersurface $C$ of degree $d$ has infinitely many points of degree $D$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. We give a new explicit proof that this set contains all (positive) multiples of the index of $C$ with finitely many exceptions. When $D$ is sufficiently large and divisible by the index of $C$, we show there are $\gg x^{1/2d^2-\epsilon}$ distinct fields with degree $D$ and discriminant $\leq x$ containing new non-singular points on $C$. Our proof relies on (what we define to be) the index of the Newton polytope $H(C)$ for $C$ which we use as combinatorial proxy for the index of $C$. We conjecture that for almost all $C$ with a given Newton polytope $H$, the index of $H$ equals the index of $C$ and we prove this conjecture for a positive proportion of curves with $H(C)=H$. As an application of our techniques, we prove half of Bhargava's conjecture on the least odd degree of points on a typical hyperelliptic and we recover Springer's theorem and a related statement for rational points on cubic hypersurfaces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Littlewood-Richardson, Kronecker and plethysm coefficients are fundamental multiplicities of interest in Representation Theory and Algebraic Combinatorics. Determining a combinatorial interpretation for the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients is a major open problem, and prompts the consideration of their computational complexity. Recently it was shown that they behave relatively well with respect to quantum computation, and for some large families there are polynomial time quantum algorithms [Larocca,Havlicek, arXiv:2407.17649] (also [BCGHZ,arXiv:2302.11454]). In this paper we show that for many of those cases the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients can also be computed in polynomial time via classical algorithms, thereby refuting some of the conjectures in [LH24]. This vastly limits the cases in which the desired super-polynomial quantum speedup could be achieved.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Naito--Sagaki conjecture asserts that the branching rule for the restriction of finite-dimensional, irreducible polynomial representations of $GL_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ to $Sp_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ amounts to the enumeration of certain ``rational paths'' satisfying specific conditions. This conjecture can be thought of as a non-Levi type analog of the Levi type branching rule, stated in terms of the path model due to Littelmann, and was proved combinatorially in 2018 by Schumann--Torres. In this paper, we give a new proof of the Naito--Sagaki conjecture independently of Schumann--Torres, using the branching rule based on the crystal basis theory for $\imath$quantum groups of type $\mathrm{AII}_{2n-1}$. Here, note that $\imath$quantum groups are certain coideal subalgebras of a quantized universal enveloping algebra obtained by $q$-deforming symmetric pairs, and also regarded as a generalization of quantized universal enveloping algebras; these were defined by Letzter in 1999, and since then their representation theory has become an active area of research. The main ingredients of our approach are certain combinatorial operations, such as promotion operators and Kashiwara operators, which are well-suited to the representation theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is the first paper in a series where we study arithmetic applications of the multiple elliptic Gamma functions originated from theoretical physics. The main purpose of this paper is the introduction of a framework for applications of these functions to Hilbert's 12th problem for general number fields with exactly one complex place following recent work by Bergeron, Charollois and Garc\'ia. Namely, we define geometric families of the multiple elliptic Gamma functions, upgrading the construction carried out by Felder, Henriques, Rossi and Zhu for rank $3$ lattices to lattices of higher ranks. These functions enjoy transformation properties under an action of the special linear group $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ for $n \geq 2$ involving some Bernoulli rational functions as their so-called modularity defect. A second purpose of this paper is to use this collection of Bernoulli rational functions to construct $(n-1)$-cocycles for specific subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ associated to units groups in totally real number fields and use these cocycles to compute partial zeta values at $s=0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The cyclic product of an arbitrary number of Szeg\"o kernels for even spin structure $\delta$ on a compact higher-genus Riemann surface $\Sigma$ may be decomposed via a descent procedure which systematically separates the dependence on the points $z_i \in \Sigma$ from the dependence on the spin structure $\delta$. In this paper, we prove two different, but complementary, descent procedures to achieve this decomposition. In the first procedure, the dependence on the points $z_i \in \Sigma$ is expressed via the meromorphic multiple-valued Enriquez kernels of e-print 1112.0864 while the dependence on $\delta$ resides in multiplets of functions that are independent of $z_i$, locally holomorphic in the moduli of $\Sigma$ and generally do not have simple modular transformation properties. The $\delta$-dependent constants are expressed as multiple convolution integrals over homology cycles of $\Sigma$, thereby generalizing a similar representation of the individual Enriquez kernels. In the second procedure, which was proposed without proof in e-print 2308.05044, the dependence on $z_i$ is expressed in terms the single-valued, modular invariant, but non-meromorphic DHS kernels introduced in e-print 2306.08644 while the dependence on $\delta$ resides in modular tensors that are independent of $z_i$ and are generally non-holomorphic in the moduli of $\Sigma$. Although the individual building blocks of these decompositions have markedly different properties, we show that the combinatorial structure of the two decompositions is virtually identical, thereby extending the striking correspondence observed earlier between the roles played by Enriquez and DHS kernels. Both decompositions are further generalized to the case of linear chain products of Szeg\"o kernels.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the field of characteristic two, $\mathbb F_2.$ Denote by $GL(q)$ the general linear group of rank $q$ over $\mathbb F_2.$ The algebraic transfer, introduced by W. Singer [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523], is a rather effective tool for unraveling the intricate structure of the (mod-2) cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr A}^{q,*}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2).$ The Kameko homomorphism is one of the useful tools to study the dimension of the domain of the Singer transfer. Singer conjectured that the algebraic transfer is always a monomorphism, but this remains open in general case. In this work, by constructing a novel algorithm implemented in the computer algebra system OSCAR for computing $GL(q)$-invariants of the kernel of the Kameko homomorphism, we disprove Singer's conjecture for bidegree $(6,6+36).$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We analyze algorithms for computing the $n$th prime $p_n$ and establish asymptotic bounds for several approaches. Using existing results on the complexity of evaluating the prime-counting function $\pi(x)$, we show that the binary search approach computes $p_n$ in $O(\sqrt{n} \, (\log n)^4)$ time. Assuming the Riemann Hypothesis and Cram\'er's conjecture, we construct a tighter interval around li$^{-1}(n)$, leading to an improved sieve-based algorithm running in $O(\sqrt{n} \, (\log ^{7/2} n) \, \log \log n)$ time. This improvement, though conditional, suggests that further refinements to prime gap estimates may yield provably faster methods for computing primes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Noncrossing partition posets in a Coxeter group $W$ can fail to be lattices when $W$ is not finite. When the lattice property fails for $W$ of affine type, McCammond and Sulway's construction provides a larger lattice that contains the noncrossing partition poset and that furthermore is a combinatorial Garside structure. We construct a lattice, isomorphic to McCammond and Sulway's lattice, using the representation theory of a corresponding connected tame hereditary algebra and give a representation-theoretic proof that it is a combinatorial Garside structure. To construct the lattice, we introduce para-exceptional sequences and para-exceptional subcategories in the module categories of tame hereditary algebras. Para-exceptional sequences are generalizations of exceptional sequences obtained by enlarging the set of allowed entries to include all non-homogeneous bricks. A para-exceptional subcategory is a subcategory obtained by applying a certain closure-like operator to the wide subcategory generated by a para-exceptional sequence.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For nonzero coprime integers $a$ and $b$, a positive integer $\ell$ is said to be \emph{good with respect to $a$ and $b$} if there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $\ell$ divides $a^{k} + b^{k}$. The concept of good integers has been the subject of continuous investigation since the 1990s due to their elegant number-theoretic properties and their significant applications in various areas, particularly in coding theory. This paper provides a comprehensive review of good integers, emphasizing both their theoretical foundations and their practical implications. We first revisit the fundamental number-theoretic properties of good integers and present their characterizations in a systematic manner. The exposition is enriched with well-structured algorithms and illustrative diagrams that facilitate their computation and classification. Subsequently, we explore applications of good integers in the study of algebraic coding theory. In particular, their roles in the characterization, construction, and enumeration of self-dual cyclic codes and complementary dual cyclic codes are discussed in detail. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the theory. This review not only consolidates existing results but also highlights the unifying role of good integers in bridging number theory and coding theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X_p, p\in\cP$ be a sequence of independent random variables s.t. $\bbP(X_p=\pm 1)=1/2$. Let $\te_j=\prod_{p|j}X_p$ if $j$ is square free and $\te_j=0$ otherwise. Denote $S_n=\sum_{\ell=1}^n\te_\ell$. The from this point of view proving limit theorems for $S_n$ is natural problem, since $S_n$ mimics the behavior of $e^{\sqrt{\ln(\beta)}}$. It is a natural guiding conjecture that $S_n/\sqrt n$ obeys the central limit theorem (CLT). However, S. Chatterjee conjectured (as expressed in \cite{[25]}) that the CLT should not hold. Chatterjee's conjecture was proved by Harper \cite{[17]}, and by now it is a direct consequence of a more recent breakthrough by Harper \cite{Har20} that $\frac{S_n}{b_n}\to 0$ in $L^1$, where $b_n=(n^{1/2}(\ln(\ln(n)))^{-1/4})u_n, u_n\to\infty$. In particular $S_n/\sqrt n\to 0$. Nevertheless, the question whether there exists a sequence $a_n=o(b_n)$ such that $S_n/a_n$ converges to some limit remains a mystery. Note that the corresponding problem in the Steinhaus Setting was recently resolved by \cite{Gor1}. In this paper make an attempt to shed some light on the convergence of $S_n/a_n$. Additionally, we obtain explicit estimates on hight moments of $S_n$ without restrictions on the size of the moment compared to $n$ like in \cite[Theorem 1.2]{Har19}, which is of independent interest. This is achieved by a martingale argument together with the Burkholder inequality, and it has applications in a natural number theoretic combinatorial problem. Using martingale techniques we will also obtain exponential concentration inequalities for $S_n$ (in the large deviations regime)</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is known that the $q$-deformed Virasoro algebra can be constructed from a certain representation of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_1$ algebra. In this paper, we apply the same construction to the quantum toroidal algebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ and study the properties of resulting generators $W_i(z)$ ($i=1,2$). The algebra generated by $W_i(z)$ can be regarded as a $q$-deformation of the direct sum $\mathsf{F} \oplus \mathsf{SVir}$, where $\mathsf{F}$ denotes the free fermion algebra and $\mathsf{SVir}$ stands for the $N=1$ super Virasoro algebra, also referred to as the $N=1$ superconformal algebra or the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond algebra. Moreover, the generators $W_i(z)$ admit two screening currents, and we show that their degeneration limits coincide with the screening currents of $\mathsf{SVir}$. We also establish quadratic relations satisfied by $W_i(z)$ and show that they generate a pair of commuting $q$-deformed Virasoro algebras, which degenerate into two nontrivial commuting Virasoro algebras included in $\mathsf{F} \oplus \mathsf{SVir}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Define $||n||$ to be the complexity of $n$, the smallest number of ones needed to write $n$ using an arbitrary combination of addition and multiplication. The set $\mathscr{D}$ of defects, differences $\delta(n):=||n||-3\log_3 n$, is known to be a well-ordered subset of $[0,\infty)$, with order type $\omega^\omega$. This is proved by showing that, for any $r$, there is a finite set $\mathcal{S}_s$ of certain multilinear polynomials, called low-defect polynomials, such that $\delta(n)\le s$ if and only if one can write $n = f(3^{k_1},\ldots,3^{k_r})3^{k_{r+1}}$. In this paper we show that, in addition to it being true that $\mathscr{D}$ (and thus $\overline{\mathscr{D}}$) has order type $\omega^\omega$, this set satisifies a sort of self-similarity property with $\overline{\mathscr{D}}' = \overline{\mathscr{D}} + 1$. This is proven by restricting attention to substantial low-defect polynomials, ones that can be themselves written efficiently in a certain sense, and showing that in a certain sense the values of these polynomials at powers of $3$ have complexity equal to the na\"ive upper bound most of the time. As a result, we also prove that, under appropriate conditions on $a$ and $b$, numbers of the form $b(a3^k+1)3^\ell$ will, for all sufficiently large $k$, have complexity equal to the na\"ive upper bound. These results resolve various earlier conjectures of the second author.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 13 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For coprime nonzero integers $a$ and $b$, a positive integer $\ell$ is said to be {\em good} with respect to $a$ and $b$ if there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $\ell |(a^{k}+b^{k})$. Since the early 1990s, such classical good integers have been studied intensively for their number theoretic structures and for applications, notably in coding theory. This work completes the study by relaxing the coprimality hypothesis and treating the non-coprime case $\gcd(a,b)\neq1$ in a concise and self-contained way. The results are presented in terms of the classical coprime criterion and $p$-adic valuations of $\ell$. As a consequence, whenever $\ell$ is good, all admissible exponents form a single arithmetic progression with an explicit starting point and period. Some special cases are discussed in the non-coprime setting. A practical decision procedure is developed that decides the goodness of a given integer and explicitly enumerates the full set of admissible exponents. Several illustrative examples are presented.</p></details>

We give a heuristic argument to form a conjecture on the number of {\it congruence monoid primes} in $A_d$ that are $\le x$. We then provide empirical evidence that indicates our conjecture is close but may need some correction. Second, we do similar calculations for the Gaussian Integers.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field with $\mathrm{char}(K)\neq 2$, and $A$ a skewed-gentle $K$-algebra. In this case, Crawley-Boevey's description of the indecomposable $A$-modules becomes particularly easy. This allows us to provide an explicit basis for the homomorphisms between any two indecomposable representations in terms of the corresponding admissible words in the sense of Qiu and Zhou. Previously (Geiss, 1999), such a basis was only available when no asymmetric band modules were involved. We also extend a relaxed version of fringing and kisses from Br\"ustle et al. (2020) to the setting of skewed-gentle algebras. With this at hand, we obtain convenient formulae for the E-invariant and g-vector for indecomposable $A$-modules, similar to the known expressions for gentle algebras. Note however, that we allow in our context also band-modules. As an application, we describe the indecomposable, generically $\tau$-regular irreducible components of the representation varieties of $A$ as well as the generic values of the E-invariant between them in terms of tagged admissible words.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates the algebraic and graphical structure of the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{sp}$, with a focus on its decomposition into finite fields, kernels, and special subsets. We establish classical isomorphisms between $\mathbb{F}_s$ and $p\mathbb{F}_s$, as well as $p\mathbb{F}_s^{\star}$ and $p\mathbb{F}_s^{+1,\star}$. We introduce the notion of arcs and rooted trees to describe the pre-periodic structure of $\mathbb{Z}_{sp}$, and prove that trees rooted at elements not divisible by $s$ or $p$ can be generated from the tree of unity via multiplication by cyclic arcs. Furthermore, we define and analyze the set $\mathbb{D}_{sp}$, consisting of elements that are neither multiples of $s$ or $p$ nor "off-by-one" elements, and show that its graph decomposes into cycles and pre-periodic trees. Finally, we demonstrate that every cycle in $\mathbb{Z}_{sp}$ contains inner cycles that are derived predictably from the cycles of the finite fields $p\mathbb{F}_s$ and $s\mathbb{F}_p$, and we discuss the cryptographic relevance of $\mathbb{D}_{sp}$, highlighting its potential for analyzing cyclic attacks and factorization methods.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Kleshchev and Livesey proved the existence of RoCK $p$-blocks for double covers of symmetric and alternating groups over large enough coefficient rings. They proved that RoCK blocks of double covers are Morita equivalent to standard ``local" blocks via bimodules with endopermutation source. Based on this, Kleshchev and Livesey proved that these RoCK blocks are splendidly Rickard equivalent to their Brauer correspondents. The analogous result for blocks of symmetric groups, a theorem of Chuang and Kessar, was an important step in Chuang and Rouquier ultimately proving Brou\'e's abelian defect group conjecture for symmetric groups. In this paper we show that in most cases the Morita and splendid Rickard equivalences constructed by Kleshchev and Livesey descend to the ring $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p$-adic integers, hence prove Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'e's abelian defect group conjecture for most of these RoCK blocks.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given any vertex operator algebra $ V $ with an automorphism $ g $, we derive a Jacobi identity for an intertwining operator $ \mathcal{Y} $ of type $ \left( \begin{smallmatrix} W_3\\ W_1 \, W_2 \end{smallmatrix}\right) $ when $ W_1 $ is an untwisted $ V $-module, and $ W_2 $ and $ W_3 $ are $ g $-twisted $ V $-modules. We say such an intertwining operator is of $\left(\!\begin{smallmatrix} g\\ 1 \ g \end{smallmatrix}\!\right)$-type. Using the Jacobi identity, we obtain homogeneous linear differential equations satisfied by the multi-series $ \langle w_0, \mathcal{Y}_1(w_1,z_1) \cdots \mathcal{Y}_N(w_N,z_N) w_{N+1} \rangle $ when $ \mathcal{Y}_j $ are of $\left(\!\begin{smallmatrix} g\\ 1 \ g \end{smallmatrix}\!\right)$-type and the modules are $ C_1 $-cofinite and discretely graded. In the special case that $ V $ is an affine vertex operator algebra, we derive the ``twisted KZ equations" and show that its solutions have regular singularities at certain prescribed points when $ g $ has finite order. When $ V $ is general and $ g $ has finite order, we use the theory of regular singular points to prove that the multi-series $ \langle w_0, \mathcal{Y}_1(w_1,z_1) \cdots \mathcal{Y}_N(w_N,z_N) w_{N+1} \rangle $ converges absolutely to a multivalued analytic function when $ |z_1| > \cdots > |z_N| > 0 $ and analytically extends to the region $ z_i, z_i - z_j \neq 0 $. Furthermore, when $ N = 2 $, we show that these multivalued functions have regular singularities at certain prescribed points.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we study the existence and distribution of elements in finite field extensions with prescribed traces in several intermediate extensions that are also either normal or primitive normal. In the former case, we fully characterize the conditions under which such elements exist and provide an explicit enumeration of these elements. In the latter case we provide asymptotic results.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Darius Dramburg, Mads Hustad Sandøy &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 25 pages. Corrected section 5.3, added an acyclicity assumption

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate compatibility of gradings for an almost Koszul or Koszul algebra $R$ that is also the higher preprojective algebra $\Pi_{n+1}(A)$ of an $n$-hereditary algebra $A$. For an $n$-representation finite algebra $A$, we show that $A$ must be Koszul if $\Pi_{n+1}(A)$ can be endowed with an almost Koszul grading. For an acyclic basic $n$-representation infinite algebra $A$, we show that $A$ must be Koszul if $\Pi_{n+1}(A)$ can be endowed with a Koszul grading. From this we deduce that a higher preprojective grading of an (almost) Koszul algebra $R = \Pi_{n+1}(A)$ is, in both cases, isomorphic to a cut of the (almost) Koszul grading. Up to a further assumption on the tops of the degree $0$ subalgebras for the different gradings, we also show a similar result without the basic assumption in the $n$-representation infinite case. As an application, we show that $n$-APR tilting preserves the property of being Koszul for $n$-representation infinite algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a connected reductive group $G$ over a local or global field $K$, we define a *diamond* (or *power*) operation $$(\xi,n)\mapsto \xi^{\Diamond n}\,\colon\, H^1(K,G)\times {\mathbb Z}\to H^1(K,G)$$ of raising to power $n$ in the Galois cohomology pointed set (this operation is new when $K$ is a number field). We show that this power operation has many good properties. When $G$ is a torus, the set $H^1(K,G)$ has a natural group structure, and $\xi^{\Diamond n}$ then coincides with the $n$-th power of $\xi$ in this group. On the other hand, we show that a power operation on $H^1(K,G)$, functorial in $G$, which we define over local and global fields, cannot be defined for an arbitrary field $K$. Our proof of this assertion relies on the results of Appendix B written by Philippe Gille. Using this power operation, for a cohomology class $\xi$ in $H^1(K,G)$ over local or global field, we define the period ${\rm per}(\xi)$ to be the least integer $n\ge 1$ such that $\xi^{\Diamond n}=1$. We define the index ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of the degrees $[L:K]$ of finite extensions $L/K$ splitting $\xi$. The period and index of a cohomology class generalize the period and index a central simple algebra over $K$. For any connected reductive group $G$ defined over a local or global field $K$, we show that ${\rm per}(\xi)$ divides ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ and that ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ may be strictly greater than ${\rm per}(\xi)$, but they always have the same prime factors.</p></details>
