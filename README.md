| <blockquote>21 pages, including references</blockquote><br><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recent advances have linked various statements involving sumsets and cardinalities with corresponding statements involving sums of random variables and entropies. In this vein, this paper shows that the quantity $2{\bf H}\{X, Y\} - {\bf H}\{X+Y\}$ is a natural entropic analogue of the additive energy $E(A,B)$ between two sets. We develop some basic theory surrounding this quantity, and demonstrate its role in the proof of Tao's entropy variant of the Balog--Szemer\'edi--Gowers theorem. We examine the regime where entropic additive energy is small, and discuss a family of random variables related to Sidon sets. In finite fields, one can define an entropic multiplicative energy as well, and we formulate sum-product-type conjectures relating these two entropic energies.</p></details> |  |  |  |  |

| <blockquote>This version improves significantly over the previous one, generalizing the results to essentially arbitrary unramified groups (see Section 1.5 for discussion of changes). Includes a new appendix written jointly with Zhongyipan Lin</blockquote><br><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Breuil-M\'{e}zard Conjecture predicts the existence of hypothetical "Breuil-Mezard cycles" in the moduli space of mod $p$ Galois representations of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_q/\mathbb{Q}_q)$ that should govern congruences between mod $p$ automorphic forms. For generic parameters, we propose a construction of Breuil-M\'{e}zard cycles in arbitrary rank, and verify that they satisfy the Breuil-M\'{e}zard Conjecture for all sufficiently generic tame types and small Hodge-Tate weights. Our method is purely local and group-theoretic, and completely distinct from previous approaches to the Breuil-M\'ezard Conjecture. In particular, we leverage new connections between the Breuil-M\'ezard Conjecture and phenomena occurring in homological mirror symmetry and geometric representation theory.</p></details> |  |  |  |  |

| <blockquote>45 pages, comments welcome</blockquote><br><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct natural extensions of the Kudla--Millson generating series of cohomology classes of special cycles in compactified unitary Shimura varieties of signature $(n+1,1)$ and prove that they are holomorphic Hermitian modular forms. This proves the cohomological version of a conjecture of Kudla and Bruinier--Rosu--Zemel, in all codimensions up to the middle. We also develop the theory of Hermitian quasi-modular forms, with a particular focus on polynomial weighted theta functions, and prove that the generating series of Zariski closures of special cycles is a Hermitian quasi-modular form.</p></details> |  |  |  |  |

| <blockquote>v2 uploaded to correct some citation mistakes; Published in Communications in Algebra</blockquote><br><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given an odd prime $q$, a natural number $l$ and non-zero $q$-free integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{l}$, none of which are equal to $1$ or $-1$, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the polynomial $\prod_{j=1}^{l} (x^{q} - a_{j})$ to have roots modulo every positive integer. Consequently: (i) if $l \leq q$ and none of $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{l}$ is a perfect $q^{th}$ power, then the polynomial $\prod_{j=1}^{l} (x^{q} - a_{j})$ fails to have roots modulo some positive integer; $(ii)$ For every $l\in\mathbb{N}$, and every $(c_{j})_{j=1}^{l}\in\big(\mathbb{F}_{q}\setminus\{0\}\big)^{l}$, the polynomial $\prod_{j=1}^{l} (x^{q} - a_{j})$ has roots modulo every positive integer if and only if $\prod_{j=1}^{l} (x^{q} - \text{rad}_{q}\big(a_{j}^{c_{j}}\big)))$ has roots modulo every positive integer. Here $\text{rad}_{q}(a_{j})$ denotes the $q$-free part of the integer $a_{j}$.</p></details> |  |  |  |  |

| <blockquote>Improved; 10 pages</blockquote><br><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is an open problem in additive number theory to compute and understand the full range of sumset sizes of finite sets of integers, that is, the set $\mathcal{R}_{\mathbf{Z}}(h,k)= \{|hA|:A \subseteq {\mathbf{Z}} \text{ and } |A|=k\}$ for all integers $h \geq 3$ and $k \geq 3$. This paper constructs certain infinite families of finite sets of size $k$ and computes their $h$-fold sumset sizes.</p></details> |  |  |  |  |

| <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We further explore the notion of Ulam words considered by Bade, Cui, Labelle, and Li, giving some lower bounds on how many there are of a given length. Gaps between words and words of special type also reveal remarkable structure. By substantially increasing the number of computed terms, we are also able to sharpen some of the conjectures made by Bade et al.</p></details> |  |  |  |  |

| <blockquote>33 pages, 2 figures</blockquote><br><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2018, Stanton proved two types of generalisations of the celebrated Andrews--Gordon and Bressoud identities (in their $q$-series version): one with a similar shape to the original identities, and one involving binomial coefficients. In this paper, we give new proofs of these identities. For the non-binomial identities, we give bijective proofs using the original Andrews--Gordon and Bressoud identities as key ingredients. These proofs are based on particle motion introduced by Warnaar and extended by the first and third authors and Konan. For the binomial identities, we use the Bailey lemma and key lemmas of McLaughlin and Lovejoy, and the order in which we apply the different lemmas plays a central role in the result. We also give an alternative proof of the non-binomial identities using the Bailey lattice. With each of these proofs, new Stanton-type generalisations of classical identities arise naturally, such as generalisations of Kur\c{s}ung\"oz's analogue of Bressoud's identity with opposite parity conditions, and of the Bressoud--G\"ollnitz--Gordon identities.</p></details> |  |  |  |  |
| 2025-07-17 | **<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13219v1'>Vertex functions for bow varieties and their Mirror Symmetry</a>** | Tommaso Maria Botta, Hunter Dinkins | math.AG | 2507.13219 |
| <blockquote>56 pages. Comments very welcome!</blockquote><br><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the vertex functions of finite type $A$ bow varieties. Vertex functions are $K$-theoretic analogs of $I$-functions, and 3d mirror symmetry predicts that the $q$-difference equations satisfied by the vertex functions of a variety and its 3d mirror dual are the same after a change of variable swapping the roles of the various parameters. Thus the vertex functions are related by a matrix of elliptic functions, which is expected to be the elliptic stable envelope of M. Aganagic and A. Okounkov. We prove all of these statements. The strategy of our proof is to reduce to the case of cotangent bundles of complete flag varieties, for which the $q$-difference equations can be explicitly identified with Macdonald difference equations. A key ingredient in this reduction, of independent interest, involves relating vertex functions of the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety with those of a ``finer" flag variety. Our formula involves specializing certain K\"ahler parameters (also called Novikov parameters) to singularities of the vertex functions. In the $\hbar \to \infty$ limit, this statement is expected to degenerate to an analogous result about $I$-functions of flag varieties.</p></details> |  |  |  |  |

| <blockquote>48 pages + 8 tables. Comments welcome!</blockquote><br><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give a classification of the degrees of the points with rational $j$-invariant on the modular curves $X_{0}(n)$ and $X_{1}(n)$. The degrees which occur infinitely often are computed unconditionally, while those which occur finitely often are determined assuming a conjecture of Zywina. To achieve this, we define the notion of $\mathcal{H}$-closures of subgroups of $\operatorname{GL}_{2}(\widehat{\mathbb{Z}})$, and compute the $\mathcal{B}_{0}(n)$- and $\mathcal{B}_{1}(n)$-closures of images of Galois representations of elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. An application to computing the set of isolated $j$-invariants in $\mathbb{Q}$ is also given.</p></details> |  |  |  |  |

| <blockquote>v2: changed the level of generality of Theorem A, Proposition B, and several statements in Section 3 due to an error in the previous Lemma 3.5 (now corrected as Lemma 3.6); added a counterexample to the previous version of Theorem A; expanded discussion of related work and open problems; improved exposition and corrected typos; added references and acknowledgements. 27 pages, 4 figures</blockquote><br><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by constructions from applied topology, there has been recent interest in the homological algebra of linear representations of posets, particularly in the context of homological algebra relative to non-standard exact structures. A prominent example is the spread exact structure on the category of representations of a fixed poset, in which the indecomposable projectives are the spread representations (that is, the indicator representations of convex and connected subsets). The spread-global dimension is known to be finite for finite posets and not uniformly bounded on the collection of all Cartesian products between two arbitrary finite total orders. It was conjectured in [AENY23] that the spread-global dimension is uniformly bounded on the collection of all Cartesian products between a fixed finite total order and an arbitrary finite total order. We provide a positive answer to this conjecture and, more generally, prove that the spread-global dimension is uniformly bounded on the collection of all Cartesian products between a fixed finite poset and an arbitrary finite total order. In doing so, we also establish the existence of finite spread-resolutions for finitely presented representations of arbitrary grid posets.</p></details> |  |  |  |  |
