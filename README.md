 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sarah Brauner, Patricia Commins, Victor Reiner &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We examine from an invariant theory viewpoint the monoid algebras for two monoids having large symmetry groups. The first monoid is the free left-regular band on $n$ letters, defined on the set of all injective words, that is, the words with at most one occurrence of each letter. This monoid carries the action of the symmetric group. The second monoid is one of its $q$-analogues, considered by K. Brown, carrying an action of the finite general linear group. In both cases, we show that the invariant subalgebras are semisimple commutative algebras, and characterize them using Stirling and $q$-Stirling numbers. We then use results from the theory of random walks and random-to-top shuffling to decompose the entire monoid algebra into irreducibles, simultaneously as a module over the invariant ring and as a group representation. Our irreducible decompositions are described in terms of derangement symmetric functions introduced by D\'esarm\'enien and Wachs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using a sieve-theoretic argument, we show that almost all gaps $(p_n, p_{n+1})$ between consecutive primes $p_n, p_{n+1}$ contain a natural number $m$ whose least prime factor $p(m)$ is at least the length $p_{n+1} - p_n$ of the gap, confirming a prediction of Erd\H{o}s. In fact the number $N(X)$ of exceptional gaps with $p_n \in [X,2X]$ is shown to be at most $O(X/\log^2 X)$. Assuming a form of the Hardy--Littlewood prime tuples conjecture, we establish a more precise asymptotic $N(X) \sim c X / \log^2 X$ for an explicit constant $c>0$, which we believe to be between $2.7$ and $2.8$. To obtain our results in their full strength we rely on the asymptotics for singular series developed by Montgomery and Soundararajan.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate a non-commutative version of strongly flat modules, which is based on the concept of universal localization introduced by Cohn. We consider a set $\sigma$ consisting of maps of finitely generated projective $R$-modules, where $R$ is not necessarily a commutative ring. Let $R_{\sigma}$ denote the universal localization of $R$ with respect to $\sigma$. The class of $\sigma$-strongly flat modules is defined as the left class in the cotorsion pair generated by $R_{\sigma}$. We examine the homotopy category of $\sigma$-strongly flat modules and demonstrate that the thick subcategory $\mathscr{S}_{\sigma}$, consisting of acyclic complexes, wherein all syzygies are $\sigma$-strongly flat, forms a precovering class within this homotopy category. This implies that the quotient map from $\mathbb{K}({\sigma\mbox{-}\mathcal{SF}})$ to $\mathbb{K}({\sigma\mbox{-}\mathcal{SF}})/\mathscr{S}_{\sigma}$ always has a fully faithful right adjoint.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Studying crepant blow-ups of (compound) du Val singularities, we classify complexes of coherent sheaves which admit no negative self-extensions -- such a complex, up to flops and mutation equivalences, must either be (1) a module over a derived-equivalent algebra, or (2) a two-term extension of a coherent sheaf by skyscraper sheaves, or (3) a direct sum of shifts of skyscrapers. This translates into classifications of bricks, spherical objects, stability conditions, and algebraic t-structures in the local derived category; the lists populated by the homological minimal programme turn out exhaustive. We deduce that the Bridgeland stability manifold is connected, and that all basic tilting complexes on the variety (equivalently on the g-tame algebras derived-equivalent to it) are related by shifts and iterated mutation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a number field. Let $\pi_1,\pi_2$ be unitary cuspidal automorphic representations of $GL_2(\mathbb{A}_F)$, and let $\pi$ be a unitary cuspidal automorphic representation of either $GL_2(\mathbb{A}_F)$ or $GL_3(\mathbb{A}_F)$. When $(\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi)$ is of general type, we show that the triple product $L$-function $L(s,\pi_1 \times \pi_2 \times \pi)$ on either $GL(2) \times GL(2) \times GL(2)$ or $GL(2) \times GL(2) \times GL(3)$ has no Siegel zero. Moreover, when $(\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi)$ is not of general type, we give precise conditions when $L(s,\pi_1 \times \pi_2 \times \pi)$ could possibly have Siegel zeros.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Niven's Theorem asserts that $\{\cos(r\pi)|r\in \mathbb{Q}\}\cap\mathbb{Q} = \{0, \pm 1, \pm\frac{1}{2}\}$. This paper uses elementary methods to classify all elements in the sets $\{\cos^n(r\pi)|r\in \mathbb{Q}, n \in \mathbb{N}\}\cap\mathbb{Q}$ and $\{\sin^n(r\pi)|r\in \mathbb{Q}, n \in \mathbb{N}\}\cap\mathbb{Q}$. Using some algebraic number theory, we extend this to a classification of all elements in $\{\tan^n(r\pi)|r\in \mathbb{Q}, n \in \mathbb{N}\}\cap\mathbb{Q}$. Finally, we present a short Galois theoretic argument to provide a more conceptual understanding of the results.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** James A. Sellers &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Small changes made in light of referee suggestions. Paper to appear in The Mathematics Student

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent article on overpartitions, Merca considered the auxiliary function $a(n)$ which counts the number of partitions of $n$ where odd parts are repeated at most twice (and there are no restrictions on the even parts). In the course of his work, Merca proved the following: For all $n\geq 0$, \begin{align*} a(4n+2) &\equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \textrm{\ \ and} \\ a(4n+3) &\equiv 0 \pmod{2}. \end{align*} Merca then indicates that a classical proof of these congruences would be very interesting. The goal of this short note is to fulfill Merca's request by providing two truly elementary (classical) proofs of these congruences.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a finite group, let $x\in G$ and let $p$ be a prime. We prove that the commutator $[x,g]$ is a $p$-element for every $g\in G$ if and only if $x$ is central modulo $O_p(G),$ where $O_p(G)$ denotes the largest normal $p$-subgroup of $G$. This result simultaneously generalizes some variants of both the Baer-Suzuki theorem and Glauberman's $Z_p^*$-theorem. Furthermore, we show that if $x\in G$ is a $p$-element and there exists an integer $m\ge 1$ such that for all $g\in G$, either $[x,g]=1$ or the order of $[x,g] $ is $m$ for every $g\in G$, then the subgroup generated by the conjugacy class of $G$ containing $x$ is solvable. As an application, we confirm a conjecture of Beltr\'an, Felipe and Melchor, which states that if $K$ is a conjugacy class of $G$ such that the product $K^{-1}K=1\cup D\cup D^{-1}$ for some conjugacy class $D$ of $G$, then the subgroup generated by $K$ is solvable.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that each snake module of the quantum Kac-Moody algebra of type $B_n^{(1)}$ admits a Langlands dual representation, as conjectured by Frenkel and Hernandez (Lett. Math. Phys. (2011) 96:217-261). Furthermore, we establish an explicit formula, called the Langlands branching rule, which gives the multiplicities in the decomposition of the character of a snake module of the quantum Kac-Moody algebra of type $B_n^{(1)}$ into a sum of characters of irreducible representations of its Langlands dual algebra.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Shamil Asgarli, Dragos Ghioca &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 36 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $L$ be a field of positive characteristic $p$ with a fixed algebraic closure $\overline{L}$, and let $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta\in L$. For an integer $d\ge 2$, we consider the family of polynomials $f_{\lambda}(z) := z^d+\lambda$, parameterized by $\lambda\in\overline{L}$. Define $C(\alpha_1,\alpha_2;\beta)$ to be the set of all $\lambda\in\overline{L}$ for which there exist $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $f_{\lambda}^m(\alpha_1)=f_{\lambda}^n(\alpha_2)=\beta$. In other words, $C(\alpha_1,\alpha_2;\beta)$ consists of all $\lambda\in\overline{L}$ with the property that the orbit of $\alpha_1$ collides with the orbit of $\alpha_2$ under the same polynomial $f_{\lambda}$ precisely at the point $\beta$. Assuming $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta$ are not all contained in a finite subfield of $L$, we provide explicit necessary and sufficient conditions under which $C(\alpha_1,\alpha_2;\beta)$ is infinite. We also discuss the remaining case where $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta\in \overline{\mathbb F}_p$ and provide ample computational data that suggest a somewhat surprising conjecture. Our problem fits into a long series of questions in the area of unlikely intersections in arithmetic dynamics, which have been primarily studied over fields of characteristic $0$. Working in characteristic $p$ adds significant difficulties, but also reveals the subtlety of our problem, especially when some of the points lie in a finite field or when $d$ is a power of $p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We formalize a proof of the irrationality of $\zeta(3)$ in Lean 4, using Beukers' method. To support this, we extend the Lean mathematical library (Mathlib) by formalizing shifted Legendre polynomials and important results in analytic number theory that were previously missing. As part of the Lean 4 PrimeNumberTheoremAnd project, we also formalize the asymptotic behavior of the prime counting function, giving the first formal proof in Lean 4 of a version of the Prime Number Theorem with an error term which is stronger than what had previously been formalized. This result is a crucial ingredient in proving the irrationality of $\zeta(3)$. Our complete Lean 4 formalization is publicly available on GitHub.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 65 pages, 10 figurs

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a two-parameter refinement of the Jucys-Murphy theory, that we call the CJT-refinement, unifying Schur, zonal, and, conjecturally, Jack actions of the ring of symmetric functions on the Fock space. Applications of this formalism include a partial resolution of a recent conjecture of Coulter-Do, as well as cut-and-join recursion for $b$-Hurwitz numbers. The cut-and-join equations enable the derivation of the tropicalization of $b$--Hurwitz numbers. We also provide a first application of this tropical interpretation by answering an open problem of Chapuy-Do{\l}\k{e}ga on the polynomial structure of $b$-Hurwitz numbers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Used the concept of a 2-limit to substaintially improve our main theorem

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the 3-category $2\mathfrak{C}at$ whose objects are 2-categories, 1-morphisms are lax functors, 2-morphisms are lax transformations and 3-morphisms are modifications. The aim is to show that it carries interesting representation-theoretic information. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a small 1-category and $\mathfrak{B}im_k$ be the 2-category of bimodules over $k$-algebras, where $k$ is a commutative ring with identity. We call a covariant (resp. contravariant) pseudofunctor from $\mathcal{C}$ into $\mathfrak{B}im_k$ a modulation (resp. comodulation) on $\mathcal{C}$, define and study its representations. This framework provides a unified approach to investigate 2-representations of finite groups, modulated quivers and their representations, as well as presheaves of $k$-algebras and their modules. Moreover, several key constructions are natural ingredients in $2\mathfrak{C}at$, and thus it exhibits an interesting application of higher category theory to representation theory.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-08 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** A Bailleul, M Hayani &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate races among prime ideals in number fields when there are two or more competing conjugacy classes. In their work [4], Fiorilli and Jouve studied two-way races in number fields and showed that-unlike the classical setting of primes in arithmetic progressions-these biases can approach the extreme values of 0 and 1. They also identified when these biases tend toward one-half (as the degree of the extension grows), which we call ''moderate biases'' because that behavior mirrors the classical case. In this paper, we extend their analysis to races with r competing conjugacy classes (rway races) and precisely study the cases where these biases are moderate (meaning they tend to 1/r! as the discriminant of the extension grows). Our first main result is an explicit formula for the bias in any r-way race (for all r $\ge$ 2), generalizing the two-way formula of Fiorilli and Jouve [4] and Lamzouri's r-way expression in the classical case of residue classes modulo q [12], under the same hypotheses. Using this formula, we give a criterion characterizing completely, in the abelian case, r-moderate races. Surprisingly, once r $\ge$ 3 this criterion is independent of r, making the two-way race exceptional. We also construct families of number fields exhibiting such moderacy, we prove density results for the values of logarithmic densities and exhibit different behaviors of those densities between the cases r = 3 and r $\ge$ 4.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a field $F=\mathbb{F}_q((t))$ splitting over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q((t))$. Following [KV,DR], a tamely unramified Langlands parameter $\lambda:W_F\to{}^L G(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\ell})$ in general position gives rise to a finite set $\Pi_{\lambda}$ of irreducible admissible representations of $G(F)$, called the $L$-packet. The main goal of this work is to provide a geometric description of characters $\chi_{\pi}$ of $\pi\in\Pi_{\lambda}$ and of their endoscopic linear combinations $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ in terms of homology of affine Springer fibers, thus establishing an analog of Lusztig conjectures in this case. Furthermore, each $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ can be described as the trace of Frobenius function of a conjugation equivariant perverse sheaf on the loop group by the sheaf-function correspondence. As another application, we prove that the sum $\chi_{\lambda}^{st}:=\sum_{\pi\in\Pi_{\lambda}}\chi_{\pi}$ is stable and show that the $\chi_{\lambda}^{st}$'s are compatible with inner twistings. More generally, we prove that each $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ is $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda,\kappa}$-stable.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 37pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2103.10393 by other authors

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A new homological dimension, called the Igusa-Todorov distance, is introduced to measure how far an Artin algebra is from being an Igusa-Todorov algebra. An upper bound for the dimension is established in terms of the Loewy length, leading to the conclusion that every Artin algebra has a finite Igusa-Todorov distance.Using this dimension, we derive an upper bound for the dimension of the singularity category. Furthermore, we investigate how the Igusa-Todorov distance behaves under various relationships between algebras. Specifically, we demonstrate that stable equivalences preserve the Igusa-Todorov distances for algebras without nodes, prove that it is an invariant under singular equivalence of Morita type with level, and establish bounds for the distances of algebras involved in a recollement of derived module categories. Consequently, the Igusa-Todorov distance is an invariant under derived equivalences of algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For each $N\geq 2$, Asakura and Otsubo have recently introduced a smooth family of algebraic curves $\{X_{N,\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \mathbb{P}^1\setminus \{0, 1, \infty\}}$ in characteristic 0 that is closely related to hypergeometric functions and the Fermat curve of degree $N$. In this paper, we study the Gross-Kudla-Schoen modified diagonal 1-cycles of these curves. We prove that if $p \ge 3$ is a prime, then for every $\lambda$ the Griffiths Abel-Jacobi image of the modified diagonal cycle of $X_{p,\lambda}$ is nontrivial for every cuspidal choice of a base point. On the other hand, we show that the modified diagonal cycle and hence the Ceresa cycle of $X_{3,\lambda}$ is torsion in the Chow group for every $\lambda$ and every choice of a base point.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 44 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The well-known Hardy--Ramanujan inequality states that if $\omega(n)$ denotes the number of distinct prime factors of a positive integer $n$, then there is an absolute constant $C>0$ such that uniformly for $x\ge2$ and $k\in\mathbb{N}$, $$\#\{n\le x\colon\omega(n)=k\}\ll\frac{x(\log\log x+C)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!\log x}.$$ A myriad of generalizations and variations of this inequality have been discovered. In this paper, we establish a weighted version of this inequality for sifted sets, which generalizes an earlier result of Hal\'asz and implies Timofeev's theorems on shifted primes. We then explore its applications to a variety of intriguing problems, such as large deviations of $\omega$ on subsets of integers, the Erd\H{o}s multiplication table problem, divisors of shifted primes, and the image of the Carmichael $\lambda$-function. Building on the same circle of ideas, we also generalize Troupe's result on the normal order of $\omega(s(n))$ for the sum-of-proper-divisors function $s(n)$, confirming for the first time the weighted version of a special case of a 1992 conjecture by Erd\H{o}s, Granville, Pomerance, and Spiro.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 34 pages. Modified the definition of small support, revised the statement about dissonant spectra

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We extend the support theory of Benson--Iyengar--Krause to the non-Noetherian setting by introducing a new notion of small support for modules. This enables us to prove that the stable module category of a finite group is canonically stratified by the action of the Tate cohomology ring, despite the fact that this ring is rarely Noetherian. In the tensor triangular context, we compare the support theory proposed by W. Sanders (which extends the Balmer--Favi support theory beyond the weakly Noetherian setting) with our generalized BIK support theory. When the Balmer spectrum is homeomorphic to the Zariski spectrum of the endomorphism ring of the unit, the two support theories coincide as do their associated theories of stratification. We also prove a negative result which states that the Balmer--Favi--Sanders support theory can only stratify categories whose spectra are weakly Noetherian. This provides additional justification for the weakly Noetherian hypothesis in the work of Barthel, Heard and B. Sanders. On the other hand, the detection property and the local-to-global principle remain interesting in the general setting.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Accuracy in neural PDE solvers often breaks down not because of limited expressivity, but due to poor optimisation caused by ill-conditioning, especially in multi-fidelity and stiff problems. We study this issue in Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machines (PIELMs), a convex variant of neural PDE solvers, and show that asymptotic components in governing equations can produce highly ill-conditioned activation matrices, severely limiting convergence. We introduce Shifted Gaussian Encoding, a simple yet effective activation filtering step that increases matrix rank and expressivity while preserving convexity. Our method extends the solvable range of Peclet numbers in steady advection-diffusion equations by over two orders of magnitude, achieves up to six orders lower error on multi-frequency function learning, and fits high-fidelity image vectors more accurately and faster than deep networks with over a million parameters. This work highlights that conditioning, not depth, is often the bottleneck in scientific neural solvers and that simple architectural changes can unlock substantial gains.</p></details>

This class of Lie algebras includes many well-known Lie algebras, and some of this class of modules are Whittaker modules and others are not. We call these modules quasi-Whittaker modules. By introducing a new concept: the Whittaker annihilator for universal quasi-Whittaker modules, we are able to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for the irreducibility of the universal quasi-Whittaker modules. In the reducible case, we can obtain some maximal submodules. In particular, we classify the irreducible quasi-Whittaker modules for many Lie algebras, and obtain a lot of irreducible smooth $\mathcal{W}_n^+$-modules of height $2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently Amdeberhan, Sellers, and Singh introduced a new infinite family of partition functions called generalized cubic partitions. Given a positive integer $d$, they let $a_d(n)$ be the counting function for partitions of $n$ in which the odd parts are unrestricted and the even parts are $d$-colored. These partitions are natural generalizations of Chan's notion of cubic partitions, as they coincide when $d=2.$ Many Ramanujan-like congruences exist in the literature for cubic partitions, and in their work Amdeberhan, Sellers, and Singh proved a collection of congruences satisfied by $a_d(n)$ for various $d \geq 1$, including an infinite family with prime moduli. Our goal in this paper is to prove a family of congruences modulo powers of 5 for $a_3(n)$. More specifically, our main theorem asserts $$a_3\left(5^{2\alpha}n +\gamma_{\alpha} \right) \equiv 0 \pmod{5^\alpha},$$ where $$\gamma_{\alpha} = 20 + \frac{19 \cdot 25 (25^{\alpha-1}-1)}{24}.$$ In order to prove these congruences, we use an approach centered around modular functions, as in the seminal work of Watson and Atkin on proving Ramanujan's congruences for the partition function $p(n)$. However, due to the complexity of the modular curve $X_0(10)$ associated to our modular functions, the classical method cannot be directly applied. Rather, we utilize the very recently developed localization method of Banerjee and Smoot, which is designed to treat congruence families over more complicated modular curves, such as $X_0(10).$</p></details>

Our study focuses on periodic vectors with respect to this process. We define a stratification of periodic vectors according to their type, and characterize types for which the determination of periodic vectors comes down to dynamics of univariate polynomials. We then restrict to the case of a diagonal binary quadratic form $f$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, and classify rational periodic vectors for all types of period up to $5$. This includes two types which do not arise from the univariate case.</p></details>

Then for many $c$ and $d$, we prove that $f_{d,c}^n(x)-\alpha$ has at most $d$ factors in $K[x]$ for all $n\geq1$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a new systematic method for evaluating generalized log-sine integrals in terms of polylogarithms. Our approach is based on an identity connecting ordinary generating functions of polylogarithms to integrals involving the sine function. This method provides closed-form expressions for log-sine integrals of weight up to 4 using only classical polylogarithms, while higher weights require Nielsen polylogarithms. Later we generalize this identity and show how it gives rise to numerous Ap\'ery-like formulae extending results of Koecher, Leshchiner and others. We also derive hyperbolic analogues and recover several functional equations between Nielsen polylogarithms. In the process, we derive new parametric identities similar to those given by Saha and Sinha.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over a number field $k$. The Green--Griffiths--Lang conjecture relates the question of finiteness of rational points in $X$ to the triviality of rational maps from abelian varieties to $X$ and to complex hyperbolicity. Here we investigate the phenomenon of sparsity of rational points in $X$ -- roughly speaking, when there are very few rational points if counted ordered by height. We are interested in the case when sparsity holds over every finite extension of $k$, in which case we say that the variety is \emph{xeric}. We initiate a systematic study of the relation of this property with the non-existence of rational curves in $X$ as well as with certain notion of $p$-adic hyperbolicity.</p></details>

For instance, we interpret the Gerasimov-Kharchev-Lebedev-Oblezin homomorphism into the algebra of difference operators via a finite analog of the Miura transform. This algebraic identification is deduced by relating degenerate affine Hecke algebras to the simplest example of a rational Feigin-Odesskii shuffle product. As a bonus, we obtain a presentation of the latter via a mirabolic version of the Kostant-Whittaker reduction.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider certain families of integers $n$ determined by some congruence condition, such that the global root number of the elliptic curve $E_{-432n^2}: Y^2=X^3-432n^2$ is $1$ for every $n$, however a given $n$ may or may not be a sum of two rational cubes. We give explicit criteria in terms of the $2$-parts and $3$-parts of the ideal class groups of certain cubic number fields to determine whether such an $n$ is a cube sum. In particular, we study integers $n$ divisible by $3$ such that the global root number of $E_{-432n^2}$ is $1$. For example, for a prime $\ell \equiv 7 \pmod{9}$, we show that for $3\ell$ to be a sum of two rational cubes, it is necessary that the ideal class group of $\Q(\sqrt[3]{12\ell})$ contains $\frac{\Z}{6\Z}\oplus \frac{\Z}{3\Z}$ as a subgroup. Moreover, for a positive proportion of primes $\ell \equiv 7 \pmod{9}$, $3\ell$ can not be a sum of two rational cubes. A key ingredient in the proof is to explore the relation between the $2$-Selmer group and the $3$-isogeny Selmer group of $E_{-432n^2}$ with the ideal class groups of appropriate cubic number fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a general approach for showing when a set of integers $\mathscr{A}$ has infinitely many $k^{th}$ powerfree numbers without relying on equidistribution estimates for $\mathscr{A}$. In particular, we show that if the Fourier transform of $\mathscr{A}$ satisfies certain $L^{\infty}$ and $L^{1}$ bounds, and is also "decreasing" in some sense, then $\mathscr{A}$ contains infinitely many $k^{th}$ powerfree numbers. We then use this method to show that there are infinitely many cubefree palindromes in base $b\ge 1100$, and in the process we obtain new $L^{1}$ bounds for the Fourier transform of the set of palindromes. We also show that there are infinitely many squarefree integers such that its reverse is also squarefree in any base $b\ge 2$. Moreover, we show that there are infinitely many squarefree integers with a missing digit in base $b\ge 5$, and infinitely many such cubefree integers in base $b\ge 3$.</p></details>

This extends the connection between the Collatz conjecture (also known as the $3 n{+}1$-problem) and the irreducibility of its associated $C^{*}$-algebra. We also introduce homomorphisms between dynamical systems with bounded conditions that preserve the structures of these dynamical systems. We prove the existence of an isomorphism between their associated $C^{*}$-algebras is proven for every isomorphism between dynamical systems with bounded condition.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) is known to have an underlying quantum group theoretical description. We precisely pinpoint the quantum group structure, improving upon earlier work in the literature. This allows us to utilize this framework for bulk gravitational applications. We explain bulk discretization in DSSYK from the underlying irreducibility of the representations. We derive trumpet and brane amplitudes using character insertions of the quantum group, simplifying earlier calculations. Most importantly, we factorize the bulk Hilbert space dual to DSSYK in the quantum group description using a complete set of edge degrees of freedom living at a bulk entangling surface. An analogous treatment for $\mathcal{N}=1$ DSSYK is provided in the same quantum group theoretical framework.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A Steinhaus triangle modulo $m$ is a finite down-pointing triangle of elements in the finite cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ satisfying the same local rule as the standard Pascal triangle modulo $m$. A Steinhaus triangle modulo $m$ is said to be balanced if it contains all the elements of $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ with the same multiplicity. In this paper, the existence of infinitely many balanced Steinhaus triangles modulo $m$, for any positive integer $m$, is shown. This is achieved by considering periodic triangles generated from interlaced arithmetic progressions. This positively answers a weak version of a problem, due to John C.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>When $\pi:\widetilde{\Sigma}\rightarrow D^2$ is a cover of the disc branched over $n$ marked points, the braid group $B_n$ acts on the disc by homeomorphisms fixing the marked points setwise. A braid $\beta$ \textit{lifts} if there is a homeomorphism $\widetilde{\beta}\in \textit{Mod}(\widetilde{\Sigma})$ such that $\beta\circ \pi=\pi\circ \widetilde{\beta}$. For arbitrary covers, the \textit{lifting homomorphism} taking $\beta$ to $\widetilde{\beta}$ is only defined on a proper subgroup of the braid group. This paper extends the lifting homomorphism to a map from a coloured braid groupoid to a mapping class groupoid for all simple covers of the disc.

> **Comment:** Lemma 4.39 was revised

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>G.W. Mackey's celebrated obstruction theory for projective representations of locally compact groups was remarkably generalized by J. M. G. Fell and R. S. Doran to the wide area of saturated Banach *-algebraic bundles. Analogous obstruction is suggested here for discrete group graded algebras which are not necessarily saturated, i.e. strongly graded in the discrete context. The obstruction is a map assigning a certain second cohomology class to every equivariance class of absolutely simple graded modules. The set of equivariance classes of such modules is equipped with an appropriate multiplication, namely a graded product, such that the obstruction map is a homomorphism of abelian monoids. Graded products, essentially arising as pull-backs of bundles, admit many nice properties, including a way to twist graded algebras and their graded modules. The obstruction class turns out to determine the fine part that appears in the Bahturin-Zaicev-Sehgal decomposition, i.e. the graded Artin-Wedderburn theorem for graded simple algebras which are graded Artinian, in case where the base algebras (i.e. the unit fiber algebras) are finite-dimensional over algebraically closed fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Singer algebraic transfer is a fundamental homomorphism in algebraic topology, providing a bridge between the homology of classifying spaces and the cohomology of the Steenrod algebra $\mathcal{A}$, which forms the $E_2$-term of the Adams spectral sequence. The domain of its dual is isomorphic to the space of $GL_k(\mathbb{F}_2)$-invariants in the quotient of the polynomial algebra, $(\mathcal{QP_k})^{GL_k(\mathbb{F}_2)}$, where $\mathcal{P}_k$ is regarded as a module over $\mathcal{A}$. A direct computation of this invariant space and its dual (i.e., the domain of the Singer transfer) remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we construct a new algorithm to compute $(\mathcal{QP_k})^{GL_k(\mathbb{F}_2)}$, which differs from the method presented in our recent work [15]. We refer to this new approach as the Global Cluster Analysis algorithm. It builds a \emph{weight interaction graph} to identify clusters of interacting weight spaces that form closed $\Sigma_k$-submodules (where $\Sigma_k \subset GL_k(\mathbb{F}_2)$). By performing invariance analysis on these larger clusters, our algorithm enables a complete and accurate computation of the global $\Sigma_k$-invariants, which are then used to determine the final $GL_k(\mathbb F_2)$-invariants. We also introduce an algorithm to directly compute the domain of the Singer transfer for ranks $k \leq 3$ in certain generic degrees, based entirely on Boardman's modular representation theory framework [2].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Mossinghoff, Trudgian, and the first author~\cite{MMT23} recently introduced a family of arithmetic functions called ``fake $\mu$'s'', which are multiplicative functions for which there is a $\{-1,0,1\}$-valued sequence $(\varepsilon_j)_{j=1}^{\infty}$ such that $f(p^j) = \varepsilon_j$ for all primes $p$. They investigated comparative number-theoretic results for fake $\mu$'s and in particular proved oscillation results at scale $\sqrt{x}$ for the summatory functions of fake $\mu$'s with $\varepsilon_1=-1$ and $\varepsilon_2=1$. In this paper, we establish new oscillation results for the summatory functions of all nontrivial fake $\mu$'s at scales $x^{1/2\ell}$ where $\ell$ is a positive integer (the ``critical index'') depending on $f$; for $\ell=1$ this recovers the oscillation results in~\cite{MMT23}. Our work also recovers results on the indicator functions of powerfree and powerfull numbers; we generalize techniques applied to each of these examples to extend to all fake $\mu$'s.</p></details>

Our new representation is used to demonstrate the closure of the space of Enriquez kernels under convolution over homology cycles and under variations of the moduli.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a finite dimensional, bigraded module over the polynomial ring in two variables, we define its two-parameter count, a natural number, and its end-curves, a set of plane curves. These are two-dimensional analogues of the notions of bar-count and endpoints of singly-graded modules over the polynomial ring in one variable, from persistence theory. We show that our count is the unique one satisfying certain natural conditions; as a consequence, several inclusion-exclusion formulas in two-parameter persistence yield the same positive number, which equals our count, and which in turn equals the number of end-curves, giving geometric meaning to this count. We show that the end-curves determine the classical Betti tables by showing that they interpolate between generators, relations, and syzygies. Using the band representations of a certain string algebra, we show that the set of end-curves admits a canonical partition, where each part forms a closed curve on the plane; we call this the boundary of the module. As an invariant, the boundary is neither weaker nor stronger than the rank invariant, but, in contrast to the rank invariant, it is a complete invariant on the set of spread-decomposable representations. Our results connect several lines of work in multiparameter persistence, and their extension to modules over the real-exponent polynomial ring in two variables relates to two-dimensional Morse theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A well-known conjecture of Gross and Zagier states that the values of the higher automorphic Green's function at pairs of points with complex multiplication in the upper half-plane are proportional to the logarithm of an algebraic number. It was recently settled in the case of congruence subgroups of the form $\Gamma_0(N)$ by analytic methods. In this paper we provide a geometric and motivic interpretation of the general conjecture, and show that it is a consequence of a standard conjecture in the theory of motives. In addition, we define a new class of matrix-valued higher Green's functions for both odd and even weight modular forms, and show that they are single-valued periods of a motive constructed from a suitable moduli stack of elliptic curves with marked points. The motive has the structure of a biextension involving symmetric powers of the motives of elliptic curves. This suggests a very general extension of the Gross-Zagier conjecture relating values of matrix-valued higher Green's functions at points which do not necessarily have complex multiplication to special values of $L$-functions. In particular, our motivic interpretation of the Gross-Zagier log-algebraicity conjecture enables us to give a completely geometric proof in level 1 and weight 4 by showing that the motive of the moduli stack $\mathcal{M}_{1,3}$ of elliptic curves with 3 marked points is mixed Tate. In the course of this paper we develop many new foundational results on: the theory of weak harmonic lifts, meromorphic modular forms, biextensions of modular motives, and their corresponding algebraic de Rham cohomology and single-valued periods, which may all be of independent interest.</p></details>

The first two authors began a program to understand the $\mathfrak{S}$-equivariant algebra of $R$ in detail. In previous work, they classified the $\mathfrak{S}$-prime ideals of $R$. An important example of an $\mathfrak{S}$-prime is the ideal $\mathfrak{h}_s$ generated by $(s+1)$st powers of the variables. In this paper, we study the category of $R/\mathfrak{h}_s$-modules. We obtain a number of results, and mention just three here: (a) we determine the Grothendieck group of the category; (b) we show that the Krull--Gabriel dimension is $s$; and (c) we obtain generators for the derived category.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb V$ be an $\mathbb N$-graded $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra (VOA), not necessarily rational or self-dual. Using a special case of the sewing-factorization theorem from [GZ25a], we show that the end $\mathbb E=\int_{\mathbb M\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)}\mathbb M\otimes_{\mathbb C}\mathbb M'$ in $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes2})$ (where $\mathbb{M}'$ is the contragredient module of $\mathbb{M}$) admits a natural structure of associative $\mathbb C$-algebra compatible with its $\mathbb{V}^{\otimes2}$-module structure. Moreover, we show that a suitable category $\mathrm{Coh}_{\mathrm{L}}(\mathbb E)$ of left $\mathbb E$-modules is isomorphic, as a linear category, to $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)$, and that the space of vacuum torus conformal blocks is isomorphic to the space $\mathrm{SLF}(\mathbb E)$ of symmetric linear functionals on $\mathbb E$. Combining these results with the main theorem of [GZ25b], we prove a conjecture of Gainutdinov-Runkel: For any projective generator $\mathbb G$ in $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)$, the pseudo-$q$-trace construction yields a linear isomorphism from $\mathrm{SLF}(\mathrm{End}_{\mathbb V}(\mathbb{G})^{\mathrm{opp}})$ to the space of vacuum torus conformal blocks of $\mathbb V$. In particular, if $A$ is a unital finite-dimensional $\mathbb C$-algebra such that the category of finite-dimensional left $A$-modules is equivalent to $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)$, then $\mathrm{SLF}(A)$ is linearly isomorphic to the space of vacuum torus conformal blocks of $\mathbb V$. This confirms a conjecture of Arike-Nagatomo.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Quasi-characters are solutions of simple modular differential equations that form an explicit basis for the space of all admissible characters that can potentially describe rational CFT. They were classified for rank-$2$ in arXiv:1810.09472 [hep-th], where it was conjectured that their $q$-series has coefficients of alternating sign that stabilise to a fixed sign at order $\frac{c}{12}$ and sometimes undergo more exotic behaviour -- where $c$ is the central charge. Here we prove some of these conjectures and estimate the growth of coefficients near the stabilisation point. We also explain what role the signs play in the construction of admissible characters from quasi-characters.</p></details>

This wheel is in fact derived from the Milnor fiber of corresponding simple singularities of two variables, and the bilinear form on the geometric root system is the negative of its symmetrized Seifert form. Furthermore, we give a completely geometric definition of simple Lie algebras using arcs, Seifert form and variation operator of the singularity theory.</p></details>

Schmeling proved that the set of $\beta>1$ such that the corresponding $\beta$-shift has specification is of Hausdorff dimension $1$. Hu et al. proved that the set of $\beta>1$ such that the corresponding $(-\beta)$-shift has specification is of Hausdorff dimension $1$. We show that the set of $(\alpha,\beta)\in[0,1)\times(1,\infty)$ such that the corresponding $(\alpha,\beta)$-shift has specification is of Hausdorff dimension $2$. A new difficulty is a simultaneous control of two critical symbol sequences that determine the ambient shift space.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite central extension $\tilde{G}$ of a classical $p$-adic reductive group, we consider the endomorphism algebra of some induced projective generator \`a la Bernstein of the category of smooth representations of $\tilde{G}$. In the case where the Levi subgroups decompose, we can compute this algebra to get a result similar to the one previously obtained by the first author for classical $p$-adic groups, showing that this intertwining algebra is a twisted semi-direct product of an affine Hecke algebra with parameters by a twisted finite group algebra. We discuss also the general case. We give then an application to the category of genuine representations of a $p$-adic metaplectic group. Using results of C. M\oe glin relative to the Howe correspondence, we show that the Bernstein components of these groups are equivalent to tensor products of categories of unipotent representations of classical groups. This generalizes a previous result of the first author. It implies an equivalence of categories between the category of genuine representations of the $p$-adic metaplectic group and the direct sums of those of smooth representations of the corresponding odd special orthogonal group and its pure inner form.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Motivated by the construction of Newton--Okounkov bodies and toric degenerations via cluster algebras in [GHKK18, FO25], we consider a family of Newton--Okounkov polytopes of a complex smooth Fano variety $X$ related by a composition of tropicalized cluster mutations. According to the work of [HK15], the toric degeneration associated with each Newton--Okounkov polytope $\Delta$ in the family produces a completely integrable system of $X$ over $\Delta$. We investigate circumstances in which each completely integrable system possesses a monotone Lagrangian torus fiber. We provide a sufficient condition, based on the data of tropical integer points and exchange matrices, for the family of constructed monotone Lagrangian tori to contain infinitely many monotone Lagrangian tori, no two of which are related by any symplectomorphism. By employing this criterion and exploiting the correspondence between the tropical integer points and the dual canonical basis elements, we generate infinitely many distinct monotone Lagrangian tori on flag manifolds of arbitrary type except in a few cases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A cluster algebra is an algebraic structure generated by operations of a quiver (a directed graph) called the mutations and their associated simple birational mappings. By using a graph-combinatorial approach, we present a systematic way to derive a tropical, i.e. subtraction-free birational, representation of Weyl groups from cluster algebras. Our results provide an extensive class of Weyl group actions, including previously known examples with algebro-geometric background, and hence are relevant to the q-Painleve equations and their higher-order extensions. Key ingredients of the argument are the combinatorial aspects of the reflection associated with a cycle subgraph in the quiver. We also study symplectic structures of the discrete dynamical systems thus obtained. The normal form of a skew-symmetric integer matrix allows us to choose Darboux coordinates while preserving the birationality.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider subsets of linearly independent roots in a certain root system $\varPhi$. Let $S'$ be such a subset, and let $S'$ be associated with any Carter diagram $\Gamma'$. The main question of the paper: what root $\gamma \in \varPhi$ can be added to $S'$ so that $S' \cup \gamma$ is also a subset of linearly independent roots? This extra root $\gamma$ is called the linkage root. The vector $\gamma^{\nabla}$ of inner products $\{(\gamma,\tau'_i)\mid \tau'_i \in S'\}$ is called the linkage label vector. Let $B_{\Gamma'}$ be the Cartan matrix associated with $\Gamma'$. It is shown that $\gamma$ is a linkage root if and only if $\mathscr{B}^{\vee}_{\Gamma'}(\gamma^{\nabla}) < 2$, where $\mathscr{B}^{\vee}_{\Gamma'}$ is a quadratic form with the matrix inverse to $B_{\Gamma'}$. The set of all linkage roots for $\Gamma'$ is called a linkage system and is denoted by $\mathscr{L}(\Gamma')$. The Cartan matrix associated with any Carter diagram $\Gamma'$ is conjugate to the Cartan matrix associated with some Dynkin diagram $\Gamma$, [St23]. The sizes of $\mathscr{L}(\Gamma')$ and $\mathscr{L}(\Gamma)$ are the same. Let $W^{\vee}$ be the Weyl group of the quadratic form $\mathscr{B}^{\vee}_{\Gamma'}$. This group acts on the linkage system and forms several orbits. The sizes and structure of orbits for linkage systems $\mathscr{L}(D_l)$ and $\mathscr{L}(D_l(a_k))$ are presented.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-05 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Bishnu Paudel, James A. Sellers, Haiyang Wang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define $\overline{R_l^*}(n)$ as the number of overpartitions of $n$ in which non-overlined parts are not divisible by $l$. In a recent work, Nath, Saikia, and the second author established several families of congruences for $\overline{R_l^*}(n)$, with particular focus on the cases $l=6$ and $l=8$. In the concluding remarks of their paper, they conjectured that $\overline{R_6^*}(n)$ satisfies an infinite family of congruences modulo $128$. In this paper, we confirm their conjectures using elementary methods. Additionally, we provide elementary proofs of two congruences for $\overline{R_6^*}(n)$ previously proven via the machinery of modular forms by Alanazi, Munagi, and Saikia.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the twisted partition function of quarter BPS states in CHL models and show that for a large class of single-centered black holes, the degeneracy of microstates is given by the Fourier coefficients of mock Jacobi forms. Our analysis is a continuation of the programme initiated by Dabholkar, Murthy and Zagier (DMZ) for $1/4$-BPS dyons in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ string theory and further extended by Bhand, Sen and Singh (BSS) to quarter BPS states in CHL models. We also present the multiplicative lift construction of the partition function and comment on the additive lift of the same.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we prove a correspondence between a canonical degree six covariant of binary quartic forms $F$ and a cubic covariant of a pair of ternary quadratic forms $(f_A, f_B)$. In the process we obtain a canonical way to diagonalize a pair of $n$-ary quadratic forms over any field $K$ of characteristic zero. As a corollary, we give a precise criterion to decide whether a pair of $n$-ary quadratic forms over $\mathbb{Q}$ is diagonalizable over $\mathbb{Q}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of a rank function on a $(d+2)$-angulated category $\mathcal{C}$ which generalises the notion of a rank function on a triangulated category. Inspired by work of Chuang and Lazarev, for $d$ an odd positive integer, we prove that there is a bijective correspondence between rank functions defined on objects in $\mathcal{C}$ and rank functions defined on morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$. Inspired by work of Conde, Gorsky, Marks and Zvonareva, for $d$ an odd positive integer, we show there is a bijective correspondence between rank functions on $\mathrm{\mathsf{Proj}}A$ and additive functions on $\mathrm{\mathsf{mod}}(\mathrm{\mathsf{Proj}}A)$, where $\mathrm{\mathsf{Proj}}A$ is endowed with the Amiot-Lin $(d+2)$-angulated category structure. This allows us to show that every integral rank function on $\mathrm{\mathsf{Proj}}A$ can be decomposed into irreducible rank functions.</p></details>
