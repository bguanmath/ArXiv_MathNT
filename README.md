### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20965v1'>2507.20965</a>\]&nbsp; **An identity relating Catalan numbers to tangent numbers with arithmetic applications**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tongyuan Zhao, Zhicong Lin, Yongchun Zang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 9 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a combinatorial identity relating Catalan numbers to tangent numbers arising from the study of peak algebra that was conjectured by Aliniaeifard and Li. This identity leads to the discovery of the intriguing identity $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}{2n\choose 2k+1}2^{2n-2k}(-1)^{k}E_{2k+1}=2^{2n+1}, $$ where $E_{2k+1}$ denote the tangent numbers. Interestingly, the latter identity can be applied to prove that $(n + 1)E_{2n+1}$ is divisible by $2^{2n}$ and the quotient is an odd number, a fact whose traditional proofs require significant calculations. Moreover, we find a natural $q$-analog of the latter identity with a combinatorial proof.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study sequences of modular representations of the symplectic and special linear groups over finite fields obtained from the first homology of congruence subgroups of mapping class groups and automorphism groups of free groups, and the module of coinvariants for the abelianization of the Torelli group. In all cases we compute the composition factors and multiplicities for these representations, and obtain periodic representation stability results in the sense of Church--Farb.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 24 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the concepts of marked multi-colorings, marked chromatic polynomials, and marked (multivariate) independence series for hypergraphs. We show that the coefficients of the q-th power of the marked independence series of a hypergraph coincide with its marked chromatic polynomials in q, thereby generalizing a corresponding result for graphs established in Chaithra et al. 2025 (arXiv:2503.11230). These notions are then naturally extended to subspace arrangements. In particular, we prove that the number of marked multi q-colorings of a subspace arrangement is a polynomial in q. We also define the (marked) independence series for subspace arrangements and prove that the (-q)-th power of the independence series of a hyperplane arrangement has non-negative coefficients. We further conjecture that the (-q)-th power of the independence series of a hypergraph has non-negative coefficients if and only if all its edges have even cardinality.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 67 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Every Anderson $A$-motive $M$ over a field determines a compatible system of Galois representations on its Tate modules at almost all primes of $A$. This adapts easily to $F$-isocrystals, which are rational analogues of $A$-motives for the global function field $F:=\mathrm{Quot}(A)$. We extend this compatible system by constructing a Weil group representation associated to $M$ for every place of $F$. To this end we generalize the Tate module construction to a tensor functor on $F_{\mathfrak{p}}$-isocrystals that are not necessarily pure. To prove that this yields a compatible system, we work out how that construction behaves under reduction of $M$. As an offshoot we obtain a new kind of $\wp$-adic Weil representations associated to Drinfeld modules of special characteristic $\wp$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a prime $p,$ let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{F}_p.$ The restriction of an irreducible mod $p$ representation of $\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ to its subgroup $\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ can be seen as a tensor product of irreducible representations of $\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p).$ In this paper, we study the restriction of some of these representations of $\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ to $\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p),$ for $q=p^2$ and $p^3$ using elementary tools and give explicit socle filtration when $q=4.$ We prove that when $q=p^2,$ a special class of representations of $\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ are distinguished by suitable characters of $\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p).$</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Elie Studnia &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We say that two elliptic curves $E$ and $F$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ are congruent modulo a prime $p$ if their $p$-torsion Galois modules (over the algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Q}$) are isomorphic. Such a congruence is called trivial if there is a rational isogeny between $E$ and $F$ with degree prime to $p$. A version of the Frey-Mazur conjecture states that any congruence modulo any prime $p \geq 19$ is trivial. Given an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ and a prime $p$, it is well-known that there is a twist of the classical modular curve $X(p)$ whose rational points describe the elliptic curves congruent to $E$ modulo $p$. In this article, we apply Mazur's strategy to determine the rational points of such a twisted modular curve under certain assumptions. In particular, we determine an explicit bound on the conductor of any elliptic curve congruent modulo $p$ to $y^2=x^3-p$ when $p$ is prime and congruent to $5$ modulo $9$, and deduce that any congruence modulo $23$ to $y^2=x^3-23$ is trivial.</p></details>

In this article we prove Whitney type extension theorems for data on some homogeneous spaces. We use harmonic analysis on the homogeneous spaces and representation theory of compact as well as noncompact reductive groups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 9 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X=G/P$ be a partial flag variety, where $G$ is a semi-simple, simply connected algebraic group defined over an algebraically closed field $K$ of positive characteristic. Let $\mathsf{F}\colon X\to X$ be the absolute Frobenius morphism. Given a line bundle $\mathscr{L}$ on $X$ and an integer $r\geq1$, we describe all line bundles that are direct summands of the pushforward $\mathsf{F}_{*}^{r}\mathscr{L}$. For $\mathscr{L}$ corresponding to a dominant weight, we also compute, for $r$ sufficiently large, the multiplicity of $\mathscr{O}_{X}$ as a summand of $\mathsf{F}_{*}^{r}\mathscr{L}$. As an application we answer a question of Gros-Kaneda about the multiplcity of $\mathscr{L}(-\rho)$ as a direct summand of $\mathsf{F}_{*}\mathscr{O}_{G/B}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2; 37 pages; minor changes and adjustments

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Wasserstein distance between probability measures on compact spaces provides a natural invariant quantitative measure of equidistribution, which is partly similar to the classical discrepancy appearing in Erd\"os-Tur\'an type inequalities in the case of tori, but is a more intrinsic quantity. We recall the basic properties of Wasserstein distances and present applications to quantitative forms of equidistribution of exponential sums in two examples, one related to our previous work on the equidistribution of ultra-short exponential sums, and the second a quantitative form of the equidistribution theorems of Deligne and Katz.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20706v1'>2507.20706</a>\]&nbsp; **An introduction to the symmetric group algebra**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Darij Grinberg &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 830 pages. Lots of details (the writing ended up more undergrad-level than I originally intended). Includes a SageMath tutorial ({\S}3.14). Comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is an introduction to the group algebras of the symmetric groups, written for a quarter-long graduate course. After recalling the definition of group algebras (and monoid algebras) in general, as well as basic properties of permutations, we introduce several families of elements in the symmetric group algebras $\mathbf{k}[S_n]$ such as the Young--Jucys--Murphy elements, the (sign-)integrals and the conjugacy class sums. Then comes a chapter on group actions and representations in general, followed by the core of this text: a study of the representations of symmetric groups (i.e., of left $\mathbf{k}[S_n]$-modules), including the classical theory of Young tableaux and Young symmetrizers. We prove in detail the main facts including the characterization of irreducible representations (in characteristic $0$), the Garnir relations, the standard basis theorem, the description of duals of Specht modules, and the hook length formula, as well as a number of less known results. Finally, we describe several bases of $\mathbf{k}[S_n]$ that arise from the study of Specht modules, including the Murphy cellular bases. The methods used are elementary and computational. We aim to assume as little as possible of the base ring $\mathbf{k}$, and to use as little as possible from representation theory (nothing more advanced than Maschke and Jordan--H\"older). Over 100 exercises (without solutions) are scattered through the text.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Yujiao Jiang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 35 pages. Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove Hypothesis H in full generality for ${\rm GL}_n$ over any number field. This result is a consequence of our stronger effective bound on Euler products involving Rankin--Selberg coefficients at prime ideal powers. The proof rests on a new analytic method, which employs a power sieve over number fields and an iterative argument to bypass the functoriality barrier that had restricted prior results to $n\leq 4$. As applications, we unconditionally establish the GUE statistics for automorphic $L$-function zeros, provide the first effective polynomial bound for the strong multiplicity one problem for coefficients, and resolve the Selberg orthogonality conjecture with stronger error terms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a field $\mathbb{F}$, we introduce a novel group $SD(\mathbb{F})$ of its self-maps: the solutions $f \colon \mathbb{F} \twoheadrightarrow \mathbb{F}$ to the functional equation $f \left( (x+y)/(x-y) \right) = (f(x) + f(y))/(f(x) - f(y))$ for all $ x \neq y$ in $\mathbb{F}$. We compute this group for all fields algebraic over $\mathbb{F}_p$. In particular, this group distinguishes $\mathbb{F}_5$ among all finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$, and in fact among all subfields of $\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 11 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a small category, $\mathfrak{A}$ be a precosheaf of unital $k$-algebras on $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathfrak{M}$ be an $\mathfrak{A}$-bimodule. We introduce two new notions, namely, the Grothendieck construction $Gr_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathfrak{A}, \mathfrak{M})$ of $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{M}$, as well as the extension category algebra $\mathfrak{A} \ltimes \mathfrak{M}$. The extension category algebra contains the trivial extension algebra and the skew category algebra as special cases. If $\mathcal{C}$ is object-finite, we prove that the category of modules of $Gr_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathfrak{A}, \mathfrak{M})$ is equivalent to the category of modules over $\mathfrak{A} \ltimes \mathfrak{M}$. Finally, we obtain two LHS-spectral sequences about $Gr_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathfrak{A}, \mathfrak{N})$ for a right $\mathfrak{A}$-module $\mathfrak{N}$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** James Punch &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 8 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb{R}^m$ be endowed with the Euclidean metric. The covering radius of a lattice $\Lambda \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ is the least distance $r$ such that, given any point of $\mathbb{R}^m$, the distance from that point to $\Lambda$ is not more than $r$. Lattices can occur via the unit group of the ring of integers in an algebraic number field $\mathbb{K}$, by applying a logarithmic embedding $\mathbb{K}^*\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$. In this paper, we examine those lattices which arise from the cyclotomic number field $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)$, for a given positive integer $n\geq5$ such that $n\not \equiv 2\pmod{4}$. We then provide improvements to an upper bound in (de Araujo, 2024), and conclude with an upper bound on the covering radius for this lattice in terms of $n$ and the number of its distinct prime factors. In particular, we improve Lemma 2 of (de Araujo, 2024) and show that, asymptotically, it can be improved no further.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2, 24 pages. We add abelianizations of affine embeddings

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a connected reductive group $G_k$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ of char $\neq 2$ and a fixed point subgroup $K_k$ under an algebraic group involution, we construct a quantization and an integral model of any affine embeddings of the symmetric space $G_k/K_k$. We show that the coordinate ring of any affine embedding of $G_k/K_k$ admits a dual canonical basis. We further construct an integral model for the canonical embedding (that is, an embedding which is complete, simple, and toroidal) of $G_k/K_k$. When $G_k$ is of adjoint type, we obtain an integral model for the wonderful compactification of the symmetric space.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>When filtering a topological space by a single parameter, the theory of quiver representations provides a complete framework for decomposing the resulting persistence module to obtain its barcode. This is achieved by interpreting the persistence module as a representation of a Type $\mathbb{A}_n$ quiver. The complexity increases significantly when filtering by two or more parameters. In particular, multi-parameter persistence typically yields tame or wild type quivers whose indecomposable representations are more complicated to describe and for which arbitrary representations are much more difficult to decompose. The theme of this work is to provide a framework for restricting to subcategories of quiver representations whose objects can be distinguished from one another through computational means.</p></details>

We consider the analogs of Shimura operators for the Hermitian symmetric superpair $(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{k})$ where $\mathfrak{g}= \mathfrak{gl}(2p|2q)$ and $\mathfrak{k}= \mathfrak{gl}(p|q)\oplus \mathfrak{gl}(p|q)$ and we prove their Harish-Chandra images are specializations of certain $BC$-supersymmetric interpolation polynomials introduced by Sergeev--Veselov.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 42 pages. v4: title changed due to complaint from anonymous reviewers. v3: add the necessary condition "normals not contained in a great circle" to Conjecture 1.4. v2:references added, better clarification on the existing literature

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we construct a new family of sets via Diophantine approximation, in which the classical examples are endpoints. Our first application is on their Hausdorff dimension. We show a recent result of Ren and Wang, known sharp on orthogonal projections in the plane, is also sharp on $A+cB$, $c\in C$, thus completely settle this ABC sum-product problem. Higher dimensional examples are also discussed. In addition to Hausdorff dimension, we also consider Fourier dimension. In particular, now for every $0\leq t\leq s\leq 1$ we have an explicit construction in $\mathbb{R}$ of Hausdorff dimension $s$ and Fourier dimension $t$, together with a measure $\mu$ that captures both dimensions. In the end we give new sharpness examples for the Mockenhaupt-Mitsis-Bak-Seeger Fourier restriction theorem. In particular, to deal with the non-geometric case we construct measures of "Hausdorff dimension" $a$ and Fourier dimension $b$, even if $a<b$. This clarifies some difference between sets and measures.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ that is totally ramified over $\mathbb{Q}_p$. The set $\mathcal{M}\mathcal{F}(K)$ consists of power series in $1+zK[[z]]$ that are solutions of differential operators in $K(z)[d/dz]$ equipped with strong Frobenius structure and satisfying maximal order multiplicty (MOM) condition at zero. It turns out that this set contains an interesting class of $E$- and $G$-functions. In this work, we provide a criterion for determining the algebraic independence, over the field of analytic elements, of elements belonging to $\mathcal{M}\mathcal{F}(K)$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an irrational number $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ we consider its irrationality measure function $$ \psi_\alpha(t) = \min_{1\le q\le t,\, q\in\mathbb{Z}} \| q\alpha \|. $$ Let $\boldsymbol{\alpha} = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)$ be $n$-tuple of pairwise independent irrational numbers. For each $t \in \mathbb{R}_{>1}$ irrationality measure functions $\psi_{\alpha_1}, \dots, \psi_{\alpha_n}$ can be written in an increasing order $$\psi_{\alpha_{v_1}}(t) > \psi_{\alpha_{v_2}}(t) > \dots > \psi_{\alpha_{v_{n-1}}}(t) > \psi_{\alpha_{v_n}}(t).$$ We consider the vector of functions $\boldsymbol{v}_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}(t): \mathbb{R}_{>1} \rightarrow S_n$ associated to this order and defined as $$\boldsymbol{v}_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}(t) = ( v_1, v_2, \dots, v_{n-1}, v_n ).$$ Let $\boldsymbol{k}(\boldsymbol{\alpha})$ be the number of infinitely occurring different values of $\boldsymbol{v}_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}(t)$. It is known that if $\boldsymbol{k}(\boldsymbol{\alpha})= k$ we have $ n \leq \frac{k(k+1)}{2}.$ At the same time, for $k \geq 3$ and $n = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$ there exists an $n$-tuple $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ with $\boldsymbol{k}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) = k$. In this work we define a $k$-cyclic permutation $\pi$ and prove that in the extremal case $n = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}, \ \boldsymbol{k}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) = k$ the set of successive values of $\boldsymbol{v}_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}(t)$ is an orbit of $\pi$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$, the ratio set or the quotient set of $A$ is defined by $R(A):=\{a/b: a, b\in A, b\neq 0\}$. It is an open problem to study the denseness of $R(A)$ in the $p$-adic numbers when $A$ is the set of values attained by an integral form. In this paper we give a sufficient condition for the existence of infinitely many primes $p$ such that the ratio set of the values of an integral form is dense in $\mathbb{Q}_p$. We prove that if a form is non-singular and has at least three variables, then the ratio set of its values is dense in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for all sufficiently large $p$. We give two counterexamples to this statement if we do not assume non-singularity. The first one happens when the number of variables is equal to the degree. The other works for any number of variables but only for composite degrees, which motivates our conjecture that there are no such counterexamples of prime degree. Finally, we construct integral forms such that the ratio set of its values is dense in at least one $\mathbb{Q}_p$ but only in finitely many of them.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak g$ be a classical simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb F$ of characteristic zero or large enough, and let $\mathfrak n$ be a maximal nilpotent subalgebra of $\mathfrak g$. The main tool in representation theory of $\mathfrak n$ is the orbit method, which classifies primitive ideals in the universal enveloping algebra ${\rm U}(\mathfrak n)$ and unitary representations of the unipotent group $N=\exp(\mathfrak n)$ in terms of coadjoint orbits on the dual space $\mathfrak n^*$. In the paper, we describe explicitly coadjoint orbits of low dimension for $\mathfrak n$ as above. The answer is given in terms of subsets of positive roots. As a corollary, we provide a way to calculate the number of irreducible complex representations of dimensions $q$, $q^2$ and $q^3$ for a maximal unipotent subgroup $N(q)$ in a classical Chevalley group $G(q)$ over a finite field $\mathbb F_q$ with $q$ elements. It turned out that this number is a polynomial in $q-1$ with nonnegative integer coefficients, which agrees with Isaac's conjecture.</p></details>

We first show that when $r$ and $s$ are roots of unity, the algebra becomes a PI algebra, and we compute its PI degree explicitly using De Concini-Procesi method. We construct and classify finite-dimensional simple modules for $U^+_{r,s}(B_2)$ by analyzing a subalgebra $B\subset U^+_{r,s}(B_2)$. Simple modules are categorized into torsion-free and torsion types with respect to a distinguished normal element. We classify all torsion-free simple $B$-modules and lift them to $U^+_{r,s}(B_2)$. The remaining simple modules are constructed in the nilpotent case. This work provides a complete classification of simple $U^+_{r,s}(B_2)$-modules at roots of unity and contributes to the understanding of two-parameter quantum groups in type $B_2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A(q)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n q^n$ and $B(q)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_n q^n$ be two eta quotients. Previously, we considered the problem of when $$ a_n=0 <=> b_n=0. $$ Here we consider the ``mod $m$'' version of this problem, i.e. eta quotients $A(q)$ and $B(q)$ and integers $m>1$ such that $$ a_n \equiv 0 \pmod m <=> b_n \equiv 0 \pmod m? $$ We found results for $m=p^2$, $p=2, 3$ and $5$. For $m=4,9$, we found results which apply to infinite families of eta quotients. For example: Let $A(q)$ have the form \begin{equation} A(q) = f_1^{3j_1+1}\prod_{3\nmid i}f_i^{3j_i}\prod_{3|i}f_i^{j_i} =: \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_nq^n,\,\,B(q) = \frac{f_3}{f_1^3}A(q) =: \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_nq^n \end{equation} with $f_{k}=\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-q^{kn})$. Then \begin{align*} a_{3n}-b_{3n}&\equiv 0\pmod 9,\\ 2a_{3n+1}+b_{3n+1}&\equiv0\pmod 9,\\ a_{3n+2}+2b_{3n+2}&\equiv0\pmod 9. \end{align*} Some of these theorems also had some combinatorial implications, such as the following: Let $p_2^{(3)}(n)$ denote the number of bipartitions $(\pi_1, \pi_2)$ of $n$ where $\pi_1$ is 3-regular. Then \begin{equation*} p_2^{(3)}(n)\equiv0\pmod 9 <=> n\text{ is not a generalized pentagonal number}. \end{equation*} In the case of $m=25$, we do not have any general theorems that apply to an infinite family of eta quotients. Instead we give two tables of results that appear to hold experimentally. We do prove some individual results (using theory of modular forms), such as the following: Let the sequences $\{c_n\}$ and $\{d_n\}$ be defined by \begin{equation*} f_1^{10}=:\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_nq^n, \hspace{25pt} f_1^{5}f_5=:\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}d_nq^n. \end{equation*} Then \begin{equation*} c_n \equiv 0 \pmod{25} <=> d_n \equiv 0 \pmod{25}. \end{equation*}</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the notion of asymptotically positive infinite extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$, in the spirit of the Tsfasman-Vl\u{a}du\c{t} theory of asymptotically exact families of number fields. For asymptotically positive extensions, we obtain lower bounds on the logarithmic Weil height, establishing the Bogomolov property for a wide range of infinite non-Galois extensions. Our result encompasses the famous theorem of E. Bombieri and U. Zannier on Bogomolov property for totally $p$-adic extensions of type $(e,f)$. Additionally, our theorem can be interpreted as a $p$-adic equidistribution result on conjugates of $\alpha$, resonating with the archimedean equidistribution theorem \`{a} la F. Amoroso-M. Mignotte and Y. Bilu. In the parallel setting of elliptic curves, we derive lower bounds on the canonical height for points on an elliptic curve over asymptotically positive extensions, without any restriction on its reduction type. In particular, this extends a result of M. Baker in the context of totally $\nu$-adic extensions, where the elliptic curve is assumed to have semistable reduction at $\nu$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an algebraically closed field K, let G be a finite abelian group of K-linear automorphisms of a finite-dimensional path algebra KQ of a quiver Q. Under certain assumptions on the action of G, we show the existence of a certain kind of covering that we call a Galois semi-covering functor, which becomes a Galois covering when the group action is free. We study the module category of its skew group algebra under this functor. As an application, we obtain a complete description of the irreducible morphisms and almost split sequences of skew group algebras and show that the (stable) rank is preserved under skewness. In particular, we determine the stable rank of skew-gentle algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The first part of this paper concerns type C. We present new explicitly defined families of algebro-combinatorial structures of three kinds: combinatorial bases in representations, Newton--Okounkov bodies of flag varieties and toric degenerations of flag varieties. All three families are parametrized by the same family of polytopes: the marked chain-order polytopes of Fang and Fourier which interpolate between the type C Gelfand--Tsetlin and FFLV polytopes. Thus, in each case the obtained structures interpolate between the well-known bases, Newton--Okounkov bodies or degenerations associated with the latter two polytopes. We then obtain similar results for type B after introducing a new family of poset polytopes to be considered in place of marked chain-order polytopes. In both types our constructions and proofs rely crucially on a combinatorial connection between poset polytopes and pipe dreams.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The solution to the general univariate polynomial equation has been sought for centuries. It is well known there is no general solution in radicals for degrees five and above. The hyper-Catalan numbers $C[m_2,m_3,m_4,\ldots]$ count the ways to subdivide a planar polygon into exactly $m_2$ triangles, $m_3$ quadrilaterals, $m_4$ pentagons, etc. Wildberger and Rubine (2025) show the generating series $\mathbf{S}$ of the hyper-Catalan numbers is a formal series zero of the general geometric polynomial (meaning, general except for a constant of $1$ and a linear coefficient of $-1$). Using a variant of the series solution to the geometric polynomial that has the number of vertices, edges, and faces explicitly shown, We prove their infinite series result may be viewed as a finite identity at each level, where a level is a truncation of $\mathbf{S}$ to a given maximum number of vertices, edges, or faces (bounded by degree). We illustrate this result, as well as the general correspondence between operations on sets of subdivided polygons and the algebra of polynomials, with figures and animations generated using Python.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent work, the author, in collaboration with Allen, Long, and Tu, developed the Explicit Hypergeometric Modularity Method (EHMM), which establishes the modularity of a large class of hypergeometric Galois representations in dimensions two and three. One important application of the EHMM is the construction of an explicit family of eta-quotients, which we call the $\mathbb{K}_{2}$ functions, from the hypergeometric background. In this article, we introduce an analogous family of eta-quotients, which we call the $\mathbb{K}_{3}$ functions. These $\mathbb{K}_{3}$ functions are constructed using the theory of weight one cubic theta functions originally developed by Jonathan and Peter Borwein. We then use the $\mathbb{K}_{3}$ functions in the EHMM to resolve several hypergeometric modularity conjectures of Dawsey and McCarthy. Further, we provide applications to special $L$-values of the $\mathbb{K}_{3}$ functions and to the study of generalized Paley graphs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we generalize the arithmetic degree and its related theory to dynamical systems defined over an arbitrary field $\mathbf{k}$ of characteristic $0$. We first consider a dynamical system $(X,f)$ over a finitely generated field $K$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, we introduce the arithmetic degrees $\alpha(f,\cdot)$ for $\overline{K}$-points by using Moriwaki heights. We study the arithmetic dynamical degree of $(X,f)$ and establish the relative degree formula. The relative degree formula gives a proof of the fundamental inequality, that is, the upper arithmetic degree $\overline{\alpha}(f,x)$ is less than or equal to the first dynamical degree $\lambda_1(f)$ in this setting. By taking spread-outs, we extend the definition of arithmetic degrees to dynamical systems over the field $\mathbf k$. We demonstrate that our definition is independent of the choice of the spread-out. Moreover, in this setting, we prove certain special cases of the Kawaguchi-Silverman conjecture. A main novelty of this paper is that, we give a characterization of arithmetic degrees of "transcendental points" in the case $\mathbf{k}=\mathbb{C}$, from which we deduce that $\alpha(f,x)=\lambda_1(f)$ for very general $x\in X(\mathbb{C})$ when $f$ is an endomorphism.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe a general method for giving $p$-adic interpretations of $G$-functions arising from degenerating periods of smooth projective algebraic varieties. Using this, we are able to implement a strategy due to Andr\'e for bounding heights of moduli points where period functions acquire unusual algebraic relations. This leads to new results on Galois lower bounds for special moduli, and new cases of the Zilber-Pink conjecture. In particular, we establish the first Galois-orbit lower bounds on CM moduli in non-Shimura settings. As a more technical contribution, we introduce a refinement of the Pila-Zannier strategy capable of handling Zilber-Pink-type atypical intersection problems in arbitrary dimension and for arbitrary smooth projective families.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the line defect half-indices of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons (CS) theories with (special)unitary, symplectic, orthogonal and exceptional gauge groups. We find that they have several beautiful infinite product $q$-series expressions in terms of Ramanujan's general theta function. For the theories with fundamental chiral multiplets, the pairs of the Neumann half-indices and one-point functions of the fundamental Wilson lines form a basis for the line defect indices in terms of the Rogers-Ramanujan type functions. Furthermore, the theories with an adjoint chiral admit the expressions as the eta-products. In particular, for the $SU(N)_{-2N}$ CS theory, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the BPS boundary local operators and the $N$-core partitions.</p></details>

A longstanding folklore conjecture asserts that the only solutions are the ``trivial'' ones with $y=-1$. We confirm the conjecture unconditionally for $p\leq 13$, and prove the conjecture holds for $p>911$ through a careful application of lower bounds for linear forms in two logarithms. We also show that any ``nontrivial'' solution must satisfy $y > 10^{1000}$. In addition, we establish auxiliary results that may support future progress on the problem, and we revisit some prior claims in the literature.</p></details>

As the converse of these assertions are known to hold, we obtain characterizations of $\tau$-tilting finite incidence algebras and $\mathbf{g}$-tame simply connected incidence algebras. Both results are proved using the theory of concealed algebras. The former will be deduced from the fact that tame concealed algebras are $\tau$-tilting infinite, and to prove the latter, we show that wild concealed algebras are not $\mathbf{g}$-tame. We conjecture that any incidence algebra of a finite poset is wild if and only if it is not $\mathbf{g}$-tame, and prove a result showing that there are relatively few possible counterexamples.

This puzzle is organized by the residue class modulo 3 of an integer coefficient of the main family of polynomials discussed.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The L\'evy-Khintchine theorem is a classical result in Diophantine approximation that describes the asymptotic growth of the denominators of convergents in the continued fraction expansion of a typical real number. An effective version of this theorem was proved by Phillip and Stackelberg (\textit{Math. Annalen}, 1969) and Central Limit Theorems were proved by several authors \cites{Ibragimov, Misevicius, Morita, Vallee}. In this work, we develop a new approach towards quantifying the L\'evy-Khintchine theorem. Our methods apply to the setting of higher-dimensional simultaneous Diophantine approximation, thereby providing an effective version of a theorem of Cheung and Chevallier (\textit{Annales scientifiques de l'ENS}, 2024). Further, we prove a Central Limit Theorem for best approximations in all dimensions. Unlike previous approaches to the one-dimensional problem, our approach relies on techniques from homogeneous dynamics.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Hopf envelope of a bialgebra is the free Hopf algebra generated by the given bialgebra. Its existence, as well as that of the cofree Hopf algebra, is a well-known fact in Hopf algebra theory, but their construction is not particularly handy or friendly. In this note, we offer a novel realisation of the Hopf envelope and of the cofree Hopf algebra of a finite-dimensional bialgebra as a particular quotient and sub-bialgebra, respectively, of the bialgebra itself. Our construction can also be extended to the infinite-dimensional case, provided that the bialgebra satisfies additional conditions, such as being left Artinian as an algebra or admitting a $n$-antipode, the latter being a notion hereby introduced. Remarkably, the machinery we develop also allows us to give a new description of the Hopf envelope of a commutative bialgebra and of the cofree cocommutative Hopf algebra of a cocommutative bialgebra.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish effective convergence rates in the Doeblin-Lenstra law, describing the limiting distribution of approximation coefficients arising from continued fraction convergents of a typical real number. More generally, we prove quantitative versions of the Doeblin-Lenstra law for best approximates in higher dimensions, as well as for points sampled from fractal measures on the real line, including the middle-third Cantor measure. Our method reduces the problem to proving effective convergence of Birkhoff averages for diagonal flows on spaces of unimodular lattices. A key step is to show that, despite the discontinuity of the observable of interest, it satisfies the regularity conditions on average required for effective ergodic theorems. For the fractal setting, we establish effective multi-equidistribution properties of self-similar measures under diagonal flow, extending recent work on single equidistribution by B\'enard, He and Zhang. As a consequence, we also obtain central limit theorems for these Diophantine statistics in both classical and fractal settings.</p></details>

We generalize this construction to define a link invariant $\Delta_{\mathfrak{g}}$ for any semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of rank $n$, taking values in $n$-variable Laurent polynomials. Focusing on the case $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_3$, we establish a direct relation between $\Delta_{\mathfrak{sl}_3}$ and the Alexander polynomial. We show that certain parameter evaluations of $\Delta_{\mathfrak{sl}_3}$ recover the Alexander polynomial on knots, despite the $R$-matrix not satisfying the Alexander-Conway skein relation at these points. We tabulate $\Delta_{\mathfrak{sl}_3}$ for all knots up to seven crossings and various other examples, including the Kinoshita-Terasaka knot and Conway knot mutant pair which are distinguished by this invariant.</p></details>

We prove a complementary result, that for a fixed prime $\ell \geq 7$, there are only finitely many such classes, even running over all quadratic fields. We demonstrate similar behavior between heavenly elliptic curves and elliptic curves with complex multiplication, in terms of Frobenius traces modulo $\ell$. We conjecture a stronger finiteness statement based on these new results. Finally, we produce an explicit list of elliptic curves with irrational $j$-invariants that contains all heavenly elliptic curves with complex multiplication defined over quadratic fields, supported by overwhelming computational evidence that every curve on the list is heavenly.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Jiang and Rallis (1997) defined a family of local integrals attached to a cubic polynomial and proved explicit evaluations of them over a non-archimedean local field $F$, when either $F$ contains three third roots of unity, or the defining polynomial is reducible. The restriction on $F$ allowed them, among other things, to reduce the case of irreducible polynomials of the form $x^3-a$. Pleso (2009) began the work of removing the restriction on $F$ by expressing the integral as a sum of $16$ integrals for the cubic polynomial $x^3 - b x - c$ with $b,c\in F$, and computing nine of them. In this work, we compute $15$ of Pleso's integrals, and reduce the last to an elementary assertion about the number of points on a surface over a finite field, in the special case when $F$ is the $p$-adic numbers, $F=\mathbb{Q}_p$, and $p$ is equivalent to $5$ mod $6$. Our computations essentially complete Pleso's work in that special case. In the interim, Xiong (2020) has computed the integrals for an arbitrary non-archimedean local field by a totally different approach. Our direct approach might be more extendable to analogous integrals defined using quintic polynomials, in a higher-rank setting.</p></details>

Let $A_p(x)$ denote the matrix $[x+a_{ij}]_{1\leqslant i,j\leqslant (p-1)/2}$, where $$ a_{ij}=\begin{cases} (\frac{j}{p}) &\text{if} \ i=1, \$\frac{i+j}{p}) &\text{if} \ i>1. \end{cases}$$ In 2018 Z.-W. Sun conjectured that $\det A_p(0)=-2^{(p-3)/2}$ if $p\equiv 3 \pmod{4}$, which was later confirmed by G. Zaimi. In this paper we evaluate $\det A_p(x)$ completely.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that there exist infinitely many pairs of non-isomorphic elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ sharing the same BSD invariants -- including their $L$-functions, Mordell--Weil groups, Tate--Shafarevich groups, Tamagawa numbers, regulators, and real periods -- and their Kodaira symbols and minimal discriminants, while having distinct $j$-invariants.</p></details>
