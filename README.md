 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kang Lu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a minimalistic presentation for the twisted Yangian ${}^\imath\mathscr Y$ associated with split symmetric pairs (or Satake diagrams) introduced in arXiv:2406.05067 via a Drinfeld type presentation. As applications, we establish an injective algebra homomorphism from ${}^\imath\mathscr Y$ to the Yangian $\mathscr Y$, thereby identifying ${}^\imath\mathscr Y$ as a right coideal subalgebra of $\mathscr Y$ and proving its isomorphism with the twisted Yangian in the $J$ presentation. Furthermore, we provide estimates for the Drinfeld generators of ${}^\imath\mathscr Y$ and describe their coproduct images in terms of the Drinfeld generators of $\mathscr Y$ under this identification.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider certain families of Hecke characters $φ$ over a quadratic imaginary field $F$. According to the Bloch-Beilinson conjectures, the order of vanishing of the $L$-function $L(φ,s)$ at the central point $s=-1$ should be equal to the dimension of the space of extensions of the Tate motive $\mathbb{Q}(1)$ by the motive associated with $φ$. In this article, we construct candidates for the corresponding extensions of Hodge structures, assuming that the sign of the functional equation of $L(φ,s)$ is $-1$. This is accomplished through the cohomology of variations of Hodge structures over Picard modular surfaces associated with $F$ and Harder's theory of Eisenstein cohomology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these extensions are naturally realized within certain biextensions. We outline a program to compute the biextension height and utilize it to establish the non-triviality of these extensions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 47 pages, comments are very welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Our goal in this paper is to introduce and study the Euler system of signed diagonal cycles associated with a trito-non-ordinary triple product of the form $f^B \times g^B \times \mathbf{h}^B$, where $f^B$ (resp. $g^B$) is a $p$-ordinary (resp. non-ordinary) eigenform on an indefinite quaternion algebra $B_{/\mathbb{Q}}$ of weight $2$, and $\mathbf{h}^B$ is a primitive Hida ($p$-ordinary) family. When $B=\mathrm{M}_2(\mathbb{Q})$ is split and $\mathbf{h}=\mathbf{h}^B$ has CM by an imaginary quadratic field, this allows us to develop the signed anticyclotomic Iwasawa theory for the base change $\mathrm{BC}_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(π_f)\times \mathrm{BC}_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(π_g)\times ψ$, where $ψ$ is a Hecke character of $K$. We formulate a signed Perrin-Riou-style Iwasawa main conjecture in this setting, and obtain a result on one inclusion in this conjecture. Our methods also allow us to extend Hsieh's construction of the balanced triple-product $p$-adic $L$-function to the trito-non-ordinary scenario, and to define its signed counterparts.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Daniel Caro, Marco D'Addezio &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 63 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For smooth affine varieties in positive characteristic, we identify a slope obstruction to the injectivity of the comparison morphism from rigid cohomology to rationalised crystalline cohomology. This yields a negative answer to a question of Esnault--Kisin--Petrov concerning the injectivity of the de Rham-to-crystalline comparison map for smooth affine schemes over the Witt vectors that admit good compactifications. In contrast, we establish injectivity for certain subspaces defined by slope conditions as well as in cohomological degree one. For the latter case, we also prove the result with coefficients in $F$-able overholonomic $D$-modules leveraging a generalisation of Kedlaya's full faithfulness theorem. Beyond injectivity, we obtain various separation results for the affinoid topology on rigid and convergent cohomology. These results allow us to determine integral algebraic de Rham cohomology modulo torsion and to provide a more conceptual explanation for Ertl and Shiho's construction of varieties for which integral Monsky--Washnitzer cohomology modulo torsion is not finitely generated. Along the way, we prove a new integral comparison theorem between Monsky--Washnitzer cohomology and algebraic de Rham cohomology and we define fractional $p$-adic Tate twists, computing non-integral slopes of crystalline cohomology.</p></details>

We relate this construction to the Brauer group of supersingular K3 surfaces and analyze the contribution of these classes to the Brauer-Manin obstruction. As an application, we examine the Brauer-Manin set of supersingular K3 surfaces and of varieties admitting many differential forms.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Chi Zhang, Yingpu Deng &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2021, the $p$-adic signature scheme and public-key encryption cryptosystem were introduced. These schemes have good efficiency but are shown to be not secure. The attack succeeds because the extension fields used in these schemes are totally ramified. In order to avoid this attack, the extension field should have a large residue degree. In this paper, we propose a method of constructing a kind of specific orthogonal basis in $p$-adic fields with a large residue degree, which would be helpful to modify the $p$-adic signature scheme and public-key encryption cryptosystem.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>On the circle of radius $R$ centred at the origin, consider a ``thin'' sector about the fixed line $y = αx$ with edges given by the lines $y = (α\pm ε) x$, where $ε= ε_R \rightarrow 0$ as $ R \to \infty $. We establish an asymptotic count for $S_α(ε,R)$, the number of integer lattice points lying in such a sector. Our results depend both on the decay rate of $ε$ and on the rationality/irrationality type of $α$. In particular, we demonstrate that if $α$ is Diophantine, then $S_α(ε,R)$ is asymptotic to the area of the sector, so long as $εR^{t} \rightarrow \infty$ for some $ t<2 $.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 56 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe how to glue prime-to-$p$ torsion sheaves along Harder-Narasimhan strata of Fargues-Scholze's $\mathrm{Bun}_G$ in terms of the cohomology of locally closed strata inside the smooth charts $\mathcal{M}_b \to \mathrm{Bun}_G$ constructed in [FS21], which are moduli of certain split parabolic bundles. Our computations for $G=\mathrm{GL}_2$ explicitly describe images of geometric constant term functors when restricted to a distinguished point inside $\mathrm{Bun}_{T_{\{b\}}}$, where $T_{\{b\}}$ is the split inner form of the Levi quotient of the corresponding parabolic subgroup $P_b$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 39 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of iHopf algebra, a new associative algebra structure defined on a Hopf algebra equipped with a Hopf pairing. The iHopf algebra on a Borel quantum group endowed with a $τ$-twisted Hopf pairing is shown to be a quasi-split universal iquantum group. In particular, the Drinfeld double quantum group is realized as the iHopf algebra on the double Borel. This iHopf approach allows us to develop connections between Lusztig's braid group action and ibraid group action. It will further lead to the construction of dual canonical basis in a sequel.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 48 pages, 21 figures, 1 table

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the $q$-deformation of rational numbers introduced recently by Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko. We propose three enumerative interpretations of these $q$-rationals: in terms of a new version of Ostrowski's numeration system for integers, in terms of order ideals of fence posets and in terms of perfect matchings of snake graphs. Contrary to previous results which are restricted to rational numbers greater than one, our interpretations work for all positive rational numbers and are based on a single combinatorial object for defining both the numerator and denominator. The proofs rest on order-preserving bijections between posets over these objects. We recover a formula for a $q$-analog of Markoff numbers. We also deduce a fourth interpretation given in terms of the integer points inside a polytope in $\mathbb{R}^k$ on both sides of a hyperplane where $k$ is the length of the continued fraction expansion.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By introducing a novel integration kernel for Mellin transform, we uncover many previously unknown and intriguing properties of the Witten zeta functions of rank two and three. Detailed results concerning their pole locations, residues, and special values are obtained. We propose a non-trivial conjecture regarding their derivatives at the origin, which seems to encode deep information about the root system. We also discuss their behavior at negative integers, highlighting a connection with Eisenstein series and a $p$-adic observation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Generalised Temperley-Lieb categories with regions labelled by elements of a commutative algebra were introduced by M. Khovanov and the second author in [Pure Appl. Math. Q. 19 (2023), no. 5]. We consider the case where the regions are labelled by colours, corresponding to a complete set of orthogonal idempotents of a semisimple commutative algebra. We determine when these generalised Temperley-Lieb categories are semisimple and find the direct sum decompositions of tensor products of simple objects. As the main tool we use two-variable versions of Chebychev polynomials and coloured Jones-Wenzl projectors. As a consequence, we prove a conjecture of M. Khovanov and the second author on Gram determinants and non-degeneracy of trace pairings for the associated Temperley-Lieb algebras with coloured regions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any quiver $Q$ and dimension vector $v$, Le Bruyn-Procesi proved that the invariant ring for the action of the change of basis group on the space of representations $\text{Rep}(Q,v)$ is generated by the traces of matrix products associated to cycles in the quiver. Lusztig generalised this to allow for vertices where the group acts trivially. Here we provide a simple new proof of Lusztig's theorem and determine the relations between his algebra generators for any quiver with relations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove two results on the growth of dimensions of fixed vectors of representations $π$ of $p$-adic ${\rm GL}_N$ under principal congruence subgroups: First, a uniform bound on the growth of fixed vectors in terms of the GK-dimension $π$, which we extend to a uniform bound on the Harish-Chandra--Howe coefficients. Second, for $π$ unitary, a quantitative relationship between the GK-dimension of $π$ and the rate of decay of its matrix coefficients. These results are independent of one another and proved in the framework of the Langlands and Zelevinsky classifications.</p></details>

> **Comment:** The present paper subsumes and extends sections 2,3,4 and 6 of the (unpublished) preprint arXiv:1405.2431. To appear in J. Math. Sci. Univ. Tokyo

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a dual pair $(G, G')$, in the sense of Howe, with G compact acting on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$, for an appropriate $n$, via the Weil representation $ω$. Let $\tilde{\mathrm{G}}$ be the preimage of G in the metaplectic group. Given a genuine irreducible unitary representation $Π$ of $\tilde{\mathrm{G}}$, let $Π'$ be the corresponding irreducible unitary representation of $\tilde{\mathrm{G}'}$ in the Howe duality. The orthogonal projection onto $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)_Π$, the $Π$-isotypic component, is the essentially unique symmetry breaking operator in $\mathrm{Hom}_{\tilde{\mathrm{G}}\tilde{\mathrm{G}'}}(\mathcal{H}_ω^{\infty}, \mathcal{H}_Π^{\infty}\otimes \mathcal{H}_{Π'}^{\infty})$. We study this operator by computing its Weyl symbol. Our results allow us to recover the known list of highest weights of irreducible representations of $\tilde{\mathrm{G}}$ occurring in Howe's correspondence when the rank of $\tilde{\mathrm{G}}$ is strictly bigger than the rank of $\tilde{\mathrm{G'}}$. They also allow us to compute the wavefront set of $Π'$ by elementary means.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In quantum mechanics, the following problem is important: For two orthogonal projections P and Q on a separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space V, estimate the spectral radius of the commutator [A,B], where A=2P-I, B=2Q-I. This problem is known to be equivalent to determining the spectral radius of the Bell-CHSH operator. To approach this problem, we give a method to approximate orthogonal projections on V by those on finite dimensional subspaces. This method provides an upper bound and a lower bound for the spectral radius of [A,B], which become exact when the matrix representations of P and Q are "constant-angle one-shifted form".</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The fastest known algorithm for factoring a degree $n$ univariate polynomial over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ runs in time $O(n^{3/2 + o(1)}\text{polylog } q)$, and there is a reason to believe that the $3/2$ exponent represents a ''barrier'' inherent in algorithms that employ a so-called baby-steps-giant-steps strategy. In this paper, we propose a new strategy with the potential to overcome the $3/2$ barrier. In doing so we are led to a number-theoretic conjecture, one form of which is that there are sets $S, T$ of cardinality $n^β$, consisting of positive integers of magnitude at most $\exp(n^α)$, such that every integer $i \in [n]$ divides $s-t$ for some $s \in S, t \in T$. Achieving $α+ β\le 1 + o(1)$ is trivial; we show that achieving $α, β< 1/2$ (together with an assumption that $S, T$ are structured) implies an improvement to the exponent 3/2 for univariate polynomial factorization. Achieving $α= β= 1/3$ is best-possible and would imply an exponent 4/3 algorithm for univariate polynomial factorization. Interestingly, a second consequence would be a reduction of the current-best exponent for deterministic (exponential) algorithms for factoring integers, from $1/5$ to $1/6$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the \textit{Fibonacci Quarterly} in 1964, C.~R.~Wall gave the following weighted sum of generalized Fibonacci numbers: $\sum_{i=1}^n i G_i = n G_{n+2} - G_{n+3} + G_3$, where $\left(G_n\right)_{n \geq 0}$ is defined by the recurrence $G_n = G_{n-1} + G_{n-2}$ with fixed $G_0, G_1 \in \mathbb{Z}$. In this paper, we generalize Wall's result to the Lucas sequences of the first and second kind, $\left(U_n(p,q)\right)_{n \geq 0}$ and $\left(V_n(p,q)\right)_{n \geq 0}$, and give closed forms for $\sum_{i=1}^n i U_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n i V_i$ by using Abel's summation by parts method. Moreover, we provide concrete applications, not only recovering the known weighted sums $\sum_{i=1}^n i F_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n i L_i$ of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, respectively, but also add new identities to the literature for eight well-known sequences. In particular, we give closed forms for weighted sums of Lucas sequences of the first kind such as the Pell, balancing, Jacobstahl, and Mersenne numbers, and also Lucas sequences of the second kind such as the companion Pell, double Lucas-balancing, Jacobstahl-Lucas, and Mersenne-Lucas numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the representation theory of various convolution algebras attached to the $q$-deformation of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ from an algebraic perspective and beyond the unitary case. We show that many aspects of the classical representation theory of real semisimple groups can be transposed to this context. In particular, we prove an analogue of the Harish-Chandra isomorphism and we introduce an analogue of parabolic induction. We use these tools to classify the non-unitary irreducible representations of $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. Moreover, we explicitly show how they converge to the classical admissible dual of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. For that purpose, we define a version of the quantized universal enveloping algebra defined over the ring of analytic functions on $\mathbb{R}_+^*$, which specializes at $q = 1$ to the enveloping $\ast$-algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\{λ_f(n)\}_{n \geq 1}$ be the normalized Hecke eigenvalues of a given holomorphic cusp form $f$ of even weight $k$. We show under the assumption of the existence of Littlewood's type zero free region for $L(s, f, χ)$, where $χ$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $q$, that if $X^{2/3+\varepsilon} \ll H \ll X^{1-\varepsilon}$ with $\varepsilon>0$, then for any $A\geq 1$, $$\sum_{1\leq |h|\leq H}\bigg| \sum_{\substack{X<n,\: m \leq 2X \\ n - m = h}} λ_f(n)Λ(n)λ_f(m)Λ(m) \bigg|^2 \ll_{A} \frac{HX^2}{(\log X)^{A}}$$ holds. Moreover, under an additional hypothesis on the fourth moment of certain Dirichlet polynomials (which follows from GRH for $L(s, f)$), we show that the above result can be strengthened to hold in a wider range $X^{1/3+\varepsilon}\ll H \ll X^{1-\varepsilon}$. Finally, if we average over the forms $f$, then for $X^{\varepsilon}\ll H\ll X^{1-\varepsilon}$ and for any $A\geq 1$, $$ \sum_{f\in \mathcal{H}_k}ω_f\sum_{1\leq |h|\leq H}\bigg| \sum_{\substack{X<n,\: m \leq 2X \\ n - m = h}} λ_f(n)Λ(n)λ_f(m)Λ(m) \bigg|^2 \ll_{A}\frac{HX^2}{(\log X)^{A}},$$ where $\mathcal{H}_k$ is the Hecke basis for the space of holomorphic cusp forms of weight $k$ for the full modular group $\mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$ and $ω_f$ are harmonic weights associated with $f\in \mathcal{H}_k$. These results may be viewed as modular analogues of the averaged forms of the Hardy--Littlewood prime tuple conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The universal $2$-parameter vertex algebra $W_{\infty}$ of type $W(2,3,4,\dots)$ serves as a classifying object for vertex algebras of type $W(2,3,\dots,N)$ for some $N$ in the sense that under mild hypothesis, all such vertex algebras arise as quotients of $W_{\infty}$. There is an $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ family of such $1$-parameter vertex algebras which, after tensoring with a Heisenberg algebra, are known as $Y$-algebras. They were introduced by Gaiotto and Rapčák and are expected to be the building blocks for all $W$-algebras in type $A$, i.e., every $W$-(super) algebra in type $A$ is an extension of a tensor product of finitely many $Y$-algebras. Similarly, the orthosymplectic $Y$-algebras are $1$-parameter quotients of a universal $2$-parameter vertex algebra $W^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$ of type $W(2,4,6,\dots)$, which is a classifying object for vertex algebras of type $W(2,4,\dots, 2N)$ for some $N$. Unlike type $A$, these algebras are not all the building blocks for $W$-algebras of types $B$, $C$, and $D$. In this paper, we construct a new universal $2$-parameter vertex algebra of type $W(1^3, 2, 3^3, 4, 5^3,6,\dots)$ which we denote by $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ since it contains a copy of the affine vertex algebra $V^k(\mathfrak{sp}_2)$. We identify $8$ infinite families of $1$-parameter quotients of $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ which are analogues of the $Y$-algebras. We regard $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ as a fundamental object on equal footing with $W_{\infty}$ and $W^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$, and we give some heuristic reasons for why we expect the $1$-parameter quotients of these three objects to be the building blocks for all $W$-algebras of classical types. Finally, we prove that $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ has many quotients which are strongly rational. This yields new examples of strongly rational $W$-superalgebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>I coined the term anabelomorphy (pronounced as anabel-o-morphy) as a concise way of expressing Mochizuki's idea of "anabelian way of changing ground field, rings etc." which was he has introduced in his work on his Inter-Universal Teichmuller Theory. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of this idea by studying its ramifications in the more familiar arithmetic contexts such as the theory of Galois representations, automorphic forms and related areas and establish a number of results which are of independent arithmetic interest. I also introduce the notion of anabelomorphically connected number fields in which two number fields are related by the existence of topological isomorphism between the local Galois groups at a finite list of primes of both the number fields and prove some results illustrating arithmetic consequences of this notion. The Introduction provides a detailed discussion and summary of all the results proved in this paper.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We initiate a program aimed at classifying thick ideals, Balmer spectra, and submodule categories of various stable categories of bimodules and modules for finite dimensional selfinjective algebras, and at clarifying the relationship between the universal Balmer support and the Hochschild cohomology support. In this paper, we focus mostly on the case of a unipotent Hopf algebra $A$. The stable category $\underline{\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\mathsf{env}})$ of $A$-bimodules that are projective as left and as right $A$-modules is a monoidal triangulated category under $\otimes_A$, and acts naturally on the stable category $\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A)$ of $A$. We show in this case that the Balmer spectrum $\mathsf{Spc}(\mathcal{E})$ of the thick subcategory ${\mathcal E}$ of $\underline{\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\mathsf{env}})$ generated by $A$ is homeomorphic to $\mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A))$ and defines an embedding $\mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A)) \to \mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A^{\mathsf{env}}))$. Subject to a conjectural description of spectra of finite tensor categories, we show that the spectrum of ${\mathcal E}$ is homeomorphic to ${\mathsf{Proj}}$ of the Hochschild cohomology ring of $A$, and that the Hochschild support coincides with the universal Balmer support. We show that any subcategory ${\mathcal K}$ of $\underline{\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\mathsf{env}})$ containing a thick generator admits a surjective continuous map from $\mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A))$. As a consequence, under the aforementioned conjecture, this spectrum is Noetherian, classifies the thick ideals of ${\mathcal K}$, and classifies thick ${\mathcal K}$-submodule categories of $\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A)$ via the Stevenson module-theoretic support. As examples, we present in detail the representations of finite $p$-groups.</p></details>

In the special case that $d$ divides $p-1$, they prove a formula for the higher $a$-numbers of these curves involving the number of lattice points in a complicated region of the plane. Booher and Cais had previously conjectured that for $n$ sufficiently large the higher $a$-numbers of the $n$th curve are given by formulae of the form $α(n) p^{2n} + β(n) p^n + λ_r(n) n + ν(n) $ for $n$ sufficiently large, where $α,β,ν,λ_r$ are periodic functions of $n$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a complex reductive group $G$ and a $G$-representation $\mathbf{N}$, there is an associated Coulomb branch algebra $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^\hbar$ defined by Braverman, Finkelberg and Nakajima. In this paper, we provide a new interpretation of $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^\hbar$ as the largest subspace of the equivariant Borel--Moore homology of the affine Grassmannian on which shift operators (and their deformations induced by flavour symmetries) are defined without localizations. The proofs of the main theorems involve showing that the defining equations of the Coulomb branch algebras reflect the properness of moduli spaces required for defining shift operators. As a main application, we give a very general definition of shift operators, and show that if $X$ is a smooth semiprojective variety equipped with a $G$-action, and $f \colon X \to \mathbf{N}$ is a $G$-equivariant proper holomorphic map, then the equivariant big quantum cohomology $QH^\bullet_G(X)$ defines a family of closed Lagrangians in the Coulomb branch $\mathrm{Spec}\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}$, yielding a transformation of 3d branes in 3d mirror symmetry. We further apply our construction to recover Teleman's gluing formula for Coulomb branches and to derive new generalizations of the Peterson isomorphism.</p></details>

We extend their work, introducing a method that allows for computing the action of Hecke operators directly on the cuspidal cohomology.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the generalized Hausdorff dimension of some natural subsets of $k^{-1}(3)$, where $k^{-1}(3)$ consists of the real numbers $x$ for which $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|<\frac{1}{(3+\varepsilon)q^2}$ has infinitely many rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$ for any $\varepsilon<0$ but only finitely many for any $\varepsilon>0$. It is well known that $k^{-1}(3)$ is an uncountable set with Hausdorff dimension zero. Given any dimension function $h$, we determine the exact "cut point" at which the generalized Hausdorff dimension $\mathcal{H}^h(k^{-1}(3))$ drops from infinity to zero. In particular we show that such a measure is always zero or not $σ$--finite, and, as an application, we can classify topologically $k^{-1}(3)$. Moreover, we show that the subset of attainable elements of $k^{-1}(3)$ has the same generalized Hausdorff dimension as $k^{-1}(3)$, but the subset of non--attainable elements of $k^{-1}(3)$ has a "strictly smaller" generalized Hausdorff dimension.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Zeta generators are derivations associated with odd Riemann zeta values that act freely on the Lie algebra of the fundamental group of Riemann surfaces with marked points. The genus-zero incarnation of zeta generators are Ihara derivations of certain Lie polynomials in two generators that can be obtained from the Drinfeld associator. We characterize a canonical choice of these polynomials, together with their non-Lie counterparts at even degrees $w\geq 2$, through the action of the dual space of formal and motivic multizeta values. Based on these canonical polynomials, we propose a canonical isomorphism that maps motivic multizeta values into the $f$-alphabet. The canonical Lie polynomials from the genus-zero setup determine canonical zeta generators in genus one that act on the two generators of Enriquez' elliptic associators. Up to a single contribution at fixed degree, the zeta generators in genus one are systematically expanded in terms of Tsunogai's geometric derivations dual to holomorphic Eisenstein series, leading to a wealth of explicit high-order computations. Earlier ambiguities in defining the non-geometric part of genus-one zeta generators are resolved by imposing a new representation-theoretic condition. The tight interplay between zeta generators in genus zero and genus one unravelled in this work connects the construction of single-valued multiple polylogarithms on the sphere with iterated-Eisenstein-integral representations of modular graph forms.</p></details>

Our main result yields arithmetic applications, providing new linear independence measures for linear forms in $(1+α)^{ω_i}\log^{j_i}(1+α)$ for $1 \le i \le m$ and $0 \le j_i \le r_i - 1$, where $0 < m, r_1, \ldots, r_m \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$, $ω_1, \ldots, ω_m \in \mathbb{Q}$, and $0 \le ω_1 < \cdots < ω_m < 1$. These results hold with algebraic coefficients in both the complex and $p$-adic cases. Additionally, we establish that Padé approximation of a single polylogarithm is, in general, perfect.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a mixed-characteristic local field. For an integer $m \geq 0$, we denote by $K^m / K$ the maximal $m$-step solvable extension of $K$, and by $G_K^m$ the maximal $m$-step solvable quotient of the absolute Galois group $G_K$ of $K$. We regard $G_K$ and its quotients as filtered profinite groups via the respective upper-numbering ramification filtrations. It is known from the previous result due to Mochizuki that the isomorphism class of $K$ is determined by the isomorphism class of the filtered profinite group $G_K$. In this paper, we prove that the isomorphism class of $K$ is determined by the isomorphism class of the maximal $2$-step solvable quotient $G_K^2$ as a filtered profinite group, and furthermore, that $K^m / K$ is determined functorially by the filtered profinite group $G_K^{m + 2}$ (resp. $G_K^{m + 3}$) for $m \geq 2$ (resp. $m = 0, 1$).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) allows a dealer to share a secret among a set of shareholders so that the secret can be reconstructed later from any set of qualified participants. In addition, any public verifier should be able to check the correctness of the sharing and reconstruction process. PVSS has been demonstrated to yield various applications, such as e-voting, distributed key generation, decentralized random number generation protocols, and multi-party computation. Although many concrete PVSS protocols have been proposed, their security is either proven in the random oracle model or relies on quantum-vulnerable assumptions such as factoring or discrete logarithm. In this work, we put forward a generic construction for PVSS that can be instantiated in the standard model under the Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption. Our instantiation provides the first post-quantum PVSS in the standard model, with a reasonable level of asymptotic efficiency.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the Quot and finitized Coh zeta functions of the inert quadratic orders $\mathbb{F}_q[[T]]+T^{m}\mathbb{F}_{q^{2}}[[T]]$ for every $m\geq 1$ in terms of a $2m$-fold multisum, and then show this multisum equals an $m$-fold Bressoud sum. This proves a recent conjecture of the second author, rounding up the line of exploration in the series of work by the authors and Jiang. The equality between the $2m$-fold multisum and the $m$-fold Bressoud sum is built upon generalizing the multisum by introducing a ``ghost'' parameter $a$ to its summands. We then show that such an $a$-generalization is surprisingly $a$-independent by purely $q$-theoretic techniques. Finally, we propose a refined multisum that interpolates two versions of Quot zeta functions for all three types of quadratic orders.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $Π$ be a regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic representation (RACAR) of $\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Q}})$. When $Π$ is $p$-nearly-ordinary for the maximal standard parabolic with Levi $\mathrm{GL}_1 \times \mathrm{GL}_2$, we construct a $p$-adic $L$-function for $Π$. More precisely, we construct a (single) bounded measure $L_p(Π)$ on $\mathbb{Z}_p^\times$ attached to $Π$, and show it interpolates all the critical values $L(Π\timesη,-j)$ at $p$ in the left-half of the critical strip for $Π$ (for varying $η$ and $j$). This proves conjectures of Coates-Perrin-Riou and Panchishkin in this case. We also prove a corresponding result in the right half of the critical strip, assuming near-ordinarity for the other maximal standard parabolic. Our construction uses the theory of spherical varieties to build a "Betti Euler system", a norm-compatible system of classes in the Betti cohomology of a locally symmetric space for $\mathrm{GL}_3$. We work in arbitrary cohomological weight, allow arbitrary ramification at $p$ along the Levi factor of the standard parabolic, and make no self-duality assumption. We thus give the first constructions of $p$-adic $L$-functions for RACARs of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Q}})$ of 'general type' (i.e., those that do not arise as functorial lifts) for any $n > 2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a new technique to study the distribution in residue classes of sets of integers with digit and sum-of-digits restrictions. From our main theorem, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for integers with missing digits to be uniformly distributed in arithmetic progressions, extending previous results going back to the work of Erdős, Mauduit and Sárközy. Our approach utilizes Markov chains and does not rely on Fourier analysis as many results of this nature do. Our results apply more generally to the class of multiplicatively invariant sets of integers. This class, defined by Glasscock, Moreira and Richter using symbolic dynamics, is an integer analogue to fractal sets and includes all missing digits sets. We address uniform distribution in this setting, partially answering an open question posed by the same authors.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A filtration of the morphisms of the $k$-linearization $k \mathbf{FS}$ of the category $\mathbf{FS}$ of finite sets and surjections is constructed using a natural $k \mathbf{FI}^{op}$-module structure induced by restriction, where $\mathbf{FI}$ is the category of finite sets and injections. In particular, this yields the `primitive' subcategory $ k \mathbf{FS}^0 \subset k \mathbf{FS}$ that is of independent interest; for example, the category of $k \mathbf{FS}^0$-modules is closely related to the category of $k \mathbf{FA}$-modules, where $\mathbf{FA}$ is the category of finite sets and all maps. Working over a field of characteristic zero, the subquotients of this filtration are identified as bimodules over $k \mathbf{FB}$, where $\mathbf{FB}$ is the category of finite sets and bijections, also exhibiting and exploiting additional structure. In particular, this describes the underlying $k \mathbf{FB}$-bimodule of $k \mathbf{FS}^0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a subset $\mathcal{S}\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ and fixed $n,m\in \mathbb{N}$, one can study the distribution of the value of the smallest denominator $Q\in \mathcal{S}$, for which there exists $\mathbf{P}\in \mathbb{F}_q[x]^m$ such that $\frac{P}{Q}\in B(\boldsymbolα,q^{-n})$, where $Q\in \mathcal{S}$. On the other hand, one can study the discrete analogue, when $N\in \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ is a polynomial with $deg(N)=n$ and $\boldsymbolα\in \frac{1}{N}\mathbb{F}_q[x]^m$ as a discrete probability distribution function. We prove that for any infinite subset $\mathcal{S}\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q[x]$, for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$, and for any dimension $m$, the probability distribution functions of both these random variables are equal to one another. This is significantly stronger than the real setting, where Balazard and Martin proved that these functions have asymptotically close averages, when there are no restrictions on the denominators.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Based on the fact that every finite-dimensional algebra over a field is isomorphic to the centralizer of \textbf{two} matrices, we approach the representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras over fields by centralizers of matrices. The first fundamental question is to study the centralizer of a single matrix, called a centralizer matrix algebra. By introducing three new equivalence relations on all square matrices over a field, we completely characterize Morita, derived and almost $ν$-stable derived equivalences between centralizer matrix algebras in terms of these matrix equivalences, respectively. Further, we show that a derived equivalence between centralizer matrix algebras of permutation matrices induces both a Morita equivalence and additional derived equivalences for $p$-regular parts and for $p$-singular parts. As an application, we show that the finitistic dimension conjecture and the Nakayama conjecture are valid for centralizer matrix algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The VC-dimension, introduced by Vapnik and Chervonenkis in 1968 in the context of learning theory, has in recent years provided a rich source of problems in combinatorial geometry. Given $E\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$ or $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, finding lower bounds on the VC-dimension of hypothesis classes defined by geometric objects such as spheres and hyperplanes is equivalent to constructing appropriate geometric configurations in $E$. The complexity of these configurations increases exponentially with the VC-dimension. These questions are related to the Erdős distance problem and the Falconer problem when considering a hypothesis class defined by spheres. In particular, the Erdős distance problem over finite fields is equivalent to showing that the VC-dimension of translates of a sphere of radius $t$ is at least one for all nonzero $t\in \mathbb{F}_q$. In this paper, we show that many of the existing techniques for distance problems over finite fields can be extended to a much broader context, not relying on the specific geometry of circles and spheres. We provide a unified framework which allows us to simultaneously study highly structured sets such as algebraic curves, as well as random sets.</p></details>

Theorem 2.5 (and Theorem in Introduction) is renewed; we slightly modify Katz, Hida and Tilouine's measure and construct the p-adic Hecke L-function independent of auxiliary element delta. Correspondingly, the proof of Theorem 3.2 (construction and the interpolation formula of the p-adic Artin L-function) is revised

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an algebraic Hecke character defined on a CM field $F$ of degree $2d$, Katz constructed a $p$-adic $L$-function of $d+1+δ_{F,p}$ variables in his innovative paper published in 1978, where $δ_{F,p}$ denotes the Leopoldt defect for $F$ and $p$. In the present article, we generalise the result of Katz under several technical conditions (containing the absolute unramifiedness of $F$ at $p$), and construct a $p$-adic Artin $L$-function of $d+1+δ_{F,p}$ variables, which interpolates critical values of the Artin $L$-function associated to a $p$-unramified Artin representation of the absolute Galois group $G_F$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this note, we provide three new, very short proofs of two interesting congruences for Merca's partition function $a(n)$, which enumerates integer partitions where the odd parts have multiplicity at most 2. These modulo 2 congruences were first shown elementarily by Sellers. We then frame $a(n)$ into the much broader context of eta-quotients, and suggest how to comprehensively describe its parity behavior. In particular, extensive computations suggest that $a(n)$ is odd precisely 25\% of the time.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties in the fully Hodge-Newton decomposable (or minute) case are the only larger class of ADLVs which could be described completely in the past. Instances of them play important roles in arithmetic geometry, from Harris-Taylor's proof of the local Langlands correspondence to applications in the Kudla program. We study generalizations for many of the equivalent conditions characterizing them to obtain in this way a larger class of ADLVs that still have a similarly good and computable description of their geometry. To generalize the minute condition itself, we introduce the notion of depth for a Shimura datum - the minute cases being those of depth bounded by 1, the cases we study being the ones of depth less than 2.</p></details>

This then enables us to establish for a weighted projective line $\mathbb{X}$ of tubular type an order preserving bijection between the poset of thick subcategories of $\mathrm{coh}(\mathbb{X})$ generated by an exceptional sequence and the poset $[\mathrm{id}, \tilde{c}]$ ordered by the absolute order.

Based on a recent work of Radziwill and Soundararajan, we obtain a conditional lower bound towards Keating-Snaith's conjecture for a "thin" family of cubic Hecke $L$-functions over the Eisenstein field. A key new input is certain twisted estimates of the 1-level density of zeros of cubic Hecke $L$-functions, extending the previous work of David and Güloğlu, under the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In many proofs of Fermat's Two Squares Theorem, the smallest least residue solution $x_0$ of the quadratic congruence $x^2 \equiv -1 \bmod p$ plays an essential role; here $p$ is prime and $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$. Such an $x_0$ is called a Størmer number, named after the Norwegian mathematician and astronomer Carl Størmer (1874-1957). In this paper, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for $x_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ to be a Størmer number of some prime $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$. Størmer's main interest in his investigations of Størmer numbers stemmed from his study of identities expressing $π$ as finite linear combinations of certain values of the Gregory-MacLaurin series for $\arctan(1/x)$. Since less than 600 digits of $π$ were known by 1900, approximating $π$ was an important topic. One such identity, discovered by Størmer in 1896, was used by Yasumasa Kanada and his team in 2002 to obtain 1.24 trillion digits of $π$. We also discuss Størmer's work on connecting these numbers to Gregory numbers and approximations of $π$. \u</p></details>

Tracking these categories under derived autoequivalences and the McKay correspondence, we show that (1) every point in Bridgeland's space of stability conditions on the resolution arises from a Kleinian orbifold, and (2) every positive half of the affine Yangian can be recovered from the COHA associated to some such stability condition. This provides the first example of a family of (pointwise) COHAs defined over the space of stability conditions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 2}$. By $P(n)$ we denote the set of all prime divisors of the integers in the sequence $n, n^2-1, (n^2-1)^2-1, \dots$. We ask whether the set $P(n)$ determines $n$ uniquely under the assumption that $n \neq m^2-1$ for $m \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 2}$. This problem originates in the structure theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras. We show that the sets $P(n)$ generate infinitely many equivalence classes of positive integers under the equivalence relation $n_1 \sim n_2 \iff P(n_1) = P(n_2)$. We also prove that the sets $P(n)$ separate all positive integers up to $2^{29}$, and we provide some heuristics on why the answer to our question should be positive.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $C$ be a curve of genus $g \geq 2$, and let $J$ be its Jacobian. The choice of a degree 1 divisor $e$ on $C$ gives an embedding of $C$ into $J$; we denote by $[C]_{}^{e}\in \mathrm{CH}\left( J;\mathbb{Q} \right) $ the class in the Chow group of $J$ defined by its image. It is known that the vanishing of the Ceresa cycle $\mathrm{Cer}(C,e):=[C]^{e} - [-1]_* [C]^e$ is equivalent to both the vanishing of the 1st Beauville component $[C]_{(1)}^e$ and the vanishing of the 3rd Gross--Kudla--Schoen modified diagonal cycle $Γ^3(C,e) \in \mathrm{CH}(C^3;\mathbb{Q})$. We extend this result to show that the vanishing of the $s$-th Beauville component $[C]^e_{(s)}$ for $s \geq 1$ is equivalent to the vanishing of the $(s+2)$-nd modified diagonal cycle $Γ^{s + 2}(C, e) \in \mathrm{CH}(C^{s+2};\mathbb{Q})$. Moreover, we establish "successive vanishing" results for these cycles. We apply our results to study the rational (non)-triviality of $[C]^{e}_{(s)}$ in the special case $s = 2$. Finally in the $s=1$ case, we show an integral refinement to the original statement, relating the order of torsion of $\mathrm{Cer}(C,e) \in \mathrm{CH}(J;\mathbb{Z})$ to that of $Γ^3(C,e) \in \mathrm{CH}(C^3;\mathbb{Z})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $Q$ be an arbitrary finite quiver. We use nonabelian stable envelopes to relate representations of the Maulik-Okounkov Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ to representations of the BPS Lie algebra associated to the tripled quiver $\tilde Q$ with its canonical potential. We use this comparison to provide an isomorphism between the Maulik-Okounkov Lie algebra and the BPS Lie algebra. Via this isomorphism we prove Okounkov's conjecture, equating the graded dimensions of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ with the coefficients of Kac polynomials. Via general results regarding cohomological Hall algebras in dimensions two and three we furthermore give a complete description of $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ as a generalised Kac-Moody Lie algebra with Cartan datum given by intersection cohomology of singular Nakajima quiver varieties, and prove a conjecture of Maulik and Okounkov, stating that their Lie algebra is obtained from a Lie algebra defined over the rationals, by extension of scalars. Finally, we explain how our results suggest the correct definition of critical stable envelopes in vanishing cycle cohomology.</p></details>

For sums of length $\sqrt{c}$, our method produces a non-trivial bound for all moduli except near-primes, saving $c^{-1/12}$ for products of two primes of the same size. Combining this with previous results for prime moduli, we achieve savings beyond the Pólya-Vinogradov range for all moduli.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $R$ be a principal ideal local ring of finite length with a finite residue field of odd characteristic. Let $G(R)$ denote either the general linear group or the general unitary group of degree two over $R$. We study the decomposition of tensor products of irreducible representations of $G(R)$. It is known that the irreducible representations of $G(R)$ are built from regular representations, which are classified into three types: cuspidal, split semisimple, and split non-semisimple. We prove that the tensor product of any two regular irreducible representations of distinct types has irreducible constituents with multiplicity at most two. Moreover, we show that the regular part of the tensor product of a cuspidal representation with any other regular representation is multiplicity free. When both factors are of split semisimple type, we show that the multiplicity of any regular irreducible constituent is at most $\mathrm{length}(R) + 1$, and that this bound is achieved only when the constituent is also split semisimple. In contrast, we demonstrate that the multiplicity in the tensor product of two split non-semisimple representations can grow with the cardinality of the residue field when the length of the ring is at least two. In the case when $R$ is a finite field, all such tensor product multiplicities are uniformly bounded above by two. This highlights a significant difference between the behaviour of tensor products in the field case and in the more general finite local ring setting.</p></details>

A single Cauchy--difference--quotient composition identity expresses all $β=1,4$ blocks in terms of the projection kernel and bounded rational multipliers. From these formulas we give short steepest-descent proofs of bulk and edge universality (sine/Airy/Bessel) with uniform error control, an explicit Meixner$\to$Laguerre hard-edge crossover, and a first $A^{-1}$ correction that follows directly from the integrable structure. Finally, we show that Archimedean Kuznetsov tests splice into the Pfaffian kernels by a bounded holomorphic symbol acting in the contour variable; the symbol enters only through the same Cauchy difference--quotient, so the leading sine/Airy/Bessel limits persist and the $A^{-1}$ term again comes from linearizing at the saddle(s).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Partition algebras with non-zero parameters are cellularly stratified and thus have the features of both cellular algebras and stratified algebras. Also, partition algebras form a tower of algebras. In this paper, we provide a diagrammatic approach to study the branching rules for cell modules on a tower of the partition algebras. This also allows us to calculate the structure constants of the Grothendieck ring of the tower.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve. We consider a finite sequence of rational points $\{P_1,\ldots,P_N\}$ whose $x$-coordinates form an arithmetic progression in $\mathbb{Q}$. Under the assumption of Lang's conjecture on lower bounds for canonical height functions, we prove that the length $N$ of such sequences satisfies the upper bound $\ll A^r$, where $A$ is an absolute constant and $r$ is the Mordell-Weil rank of $E/\mathbb{Q}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** There is a gap in the proof of the lower bound which we are working on fixing

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F_h(n)$ denote the minimum cardinality of an additive {\em $h$-fold basis} of $\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$: a set $S$ such that any integer in $\{1,2,\cdots, n\}$ can be written as a sum of at most $h$ elements from $S$. While the trivial bounds $h!n \; \lesssim \; F_h(n)^h \; \lesssim \; h^h n$ are well-known, comparatively little has been established for $h>2$. In this paper, we make significant improvements to both of the best-known bounds on $F_h(n)$ for sufficiently large $h$. For the lower bound, we use a probabilistic approach along with the Berry-Esseen Theorem to improve upon the best-known asymptotic result due to Yu. We also establish the first nontrivial asymptotic upper bound on $F_h(n)$ by leveraging a construction for additive bases of finite cyclic groups due to Jia and Shen. In particular, we show that given any $ε>0$, for sufficiently large $h$, we have $$ \left(\frac{1}{2}-ε\right)h!\sqrt{2πe} n\; \leq \; F_h(n)^h \; \leq \; \left(\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+ε\right)h\right)^h n. $$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a profinite group $G$ and a rigid analytic space $X$, we study when an $\mathcal O_X(X)$-linear representation $V$ of $G$ admits a lattice, i.e. an $\mathcal O_{\mathcal X(\mathcal X)}$-linear model for a suitable formal model $\mathcal X$ of $X$ in the sense of Berthelot. We give a positive answer, under mild assumptions, when $X$ is strictly quasi-Stein. As a consequence, we are able to describe explicit open rational subdomains of $X$ over which $V$ is constant after reduction modulo a power of $p$. We give applications in two different directions. First, we prove explicit results on the reduction modulo powers of $p$ of sheaves of crystalline and semistable representations of fixed weight. Second, we deduce a result on the pseudorepresentation carried by the Coleman--Mazur eigencurve, which can be made explicit whenever equations for a rational subdomain of the eigencurve are given.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $d\geq 1$, we define semibricks and wide subcategories in the $d$-extended hearts of bounded $t$-structures on a triangulated category. We show that these semibricks are in bijection with finite-length wide subcategories. When the $d$-extended heart is the $d$-extended module category $d\mbox{-}\mathrm{mod}Λ$ of a finite-dimensional algebra $Λ$ over a field, we define left/right-finite semibricks and left/right-finite wide subcategories in $d\mbox{-}\mathrm{mod}Λ$ and show bijections with $(d+1)$-term simple-minded collections, generalising the bijections between $2$-term simple-minded collections, left/right-finite wide subcategories and left/right-finite semibricks in $\mathrm{mod}Λ$. We use a relation between semibricks and silting complexes to characterise which mutations of $(d+1)$-term silting complexes are again $(d+1)$-term.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a novel zeta regularized product formula concerning regularization of trigonometric products over non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Furthermore, we calculate the discrepancies of such regularized products. In special cases, our formula reduces to the Kimoto-Wakayama formula. A conjectural relationship between such products and a weak Riemann hypothesis is speculated.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the class of polynomials that map a local field (i.e., the completion of a number field at a non-Archimedean place) into the subset of its $p$-th powers, where $p$ is the residue characteristic of the field in question. We present a characterization of such polynomials and show that this class is always much broader than the class of $p$-th powers of polynomials.</p></details>
