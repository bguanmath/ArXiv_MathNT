 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Fredy Yip &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The classical Erdős-Kac theorem states that for $n$ chosen uniformly at random from $1, \dots, N$, the random variable $(ω(n) - \log\log N)/\sqrt{\log\log N}$ converges in distribution to the standard Gaussian as $N$ tends to infinity. Banks and Shparlinski showed that this Gaussian convergence holds for any Beatty sequence $\lfloorαn + β\rfloor$ in place of $n$. Continuing in this spirit, Crnčević, Hernández, Rizk, Sereesuchart and Tao considered the joint distribution of $ω(n)$ and $ω(\lfloorαn\rfloor)$, which they showed to be asymptotically independent for irrational values of $α$. Generalising both results, we show that for any positive integer $k$, real numbers $α_1, \dots, α_k > 0$ and $β_1, \dots, β_k$, where $α_i/α_j$ is irrational for $i\neq j$, the joint distribution of $(ω(\lfloorα_in + β_i\rfloor) - \log\log N)/\sqrt{\log\log N}$ converges to the $k$-dimensional standard Gaussian. We next discuss quantitative bounds on the rate of convergence which do not depend on the values taken by the relevant parameters. Banks and Shparlinski remarked that such quantitative bounds may be given for a single Beatty sequence $\lfloorαn + β\rfloor$ under Diophantine type assumptions on $α$. We show that such assumptions are in fact unnecessary. Specifically, for any real numbers $α> 0, β$, we show that the Kolmogorov distance between the random variable $(ω(\lfloorαn + β\rfloor) - \log\log N)/\sqrt{\log\log N}$ and the standard Gaussian is bounded above by $O(\log\log\log N/\sqrt{\log\log N})$ as $N$ tends to infinity. On the other hand, we show that universal quantitative bounds of this kind do not exist for higher-degree generalised polynomials or for the joint convergence for multiple Beatty sequences.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an almost minimal R=T theorem for self-dual Galois representations with coefficients in a finite field satisfying a property called rigid. We also prove the rigidity property for a large family of residual Galois representations attached to regular algebraic self-dual representations. Our theorem is based on a Taylor--Wiles patching argument for G-valued Galois representation, where G equals GO(2m) or GSp(2m).</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00833v4'>2505.00833</a>\]&nbsp; **On The Relative Cohomology For Algebraic Groups**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Gabriel T. Loos &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.GR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be an algebraic group over a field $k$, and $M$ and $N$ be $G$-modules. In 1961, Hochschild showed how one can define the cohomology groups $\text{Ext}_{G}^{i}(M,N)$. Kimura, in 1965, showed that one can generalize this to get relative cohomology for algebraic groups. The original cohomology groups play an important role in understanding the representation theory of $G$, but the role of relative cohomology is still not well understood. In this paper the author expands upon the work of Kimura to prove foundational results about the relative cohomology. The author starts by giving the definitions of relative exact sequences and relative injective modules and proves a variety of basic properties for each that will be essential to define relative cohomology and obtain a relative Grothendieck spectral sequence. In particular, the induction functor will play an important role when studying the relative injective modules. Once the necessary ground work is laid, the definition of relative cohomology is given. Finally, it is stated when there is a relative Grothendieck spectral sequence, and many consequences and examples are provided.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 14 pages, all comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we establish the asymptotic estimates for the rational lines on diagonal cubic hypersurfaces defined by $\sum_{i=1}^sc_ix^3_i=0$ with $c_i\in\mathbb{Z}\setminus \{0\},$ provided that $s\geq 19.$ This improves the previously known bound $s\geq 21$ required to obtain such asymptotic estimates. Our approach develops a multidimensional shifting variables argument together with a pruning argument, and exploits the recent progress on the Parsell-Vinogradov system.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Veronica Calvo Cortes, Hadleigh Frost &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 20 pages, 16 figures. Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a combinatorial model of configuration spaces and polytopes associated to the quotients of $\mathbb{C} A_n$, the path algebra of the linearly oriented $A_n$ quiver, i.e. the algebra of upper triangular matrices. These quotient algebras are known as linear Nakayama algebras. Such configuration spaces were recently introduced for more general algebras by the second author and collaborators. In this special setting, we provide elementary proofs and explicit combinatorial constructions. From a Dyck path we define three related objects: a finite-dimensional algebra, an affine algebraic variety, and a polytope. Moreover, our constructions are natural: each relation in the poset of Dyck paths gives a morphism between the corresponding objects.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a prime power \( q \) and a positive integer \( n \), a subspace \( U \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^n \) is called cyclically covering if the union of all its cyclic shifts covers the whole space \( \mathbb{F}_q^n \). Let \( h_q(n) \) denote the maximum possible codimension of such a subspace. This paper focuses on the case \( h_q(n) = 0 \). We provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which \( h_q(n) = 0 \) holds. As an application, we show that \( h_q(\ell^t) = 0 \) whenever \( q \) is a primitive root modulo \( \ell^t \). Moreover, we prove that if \( n \) is odd and \( h_q(n) = 0 \), then also \( h_q(2n) = 0 \). As an example, we show that \( h_3(11) =h_3(16) = 1 \). Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between the coverings of \(\mathbb{F}_{q^m}^n\) and \(\mathbb{F}_q^{mn}\), and obtain several sufficient conditions for \(h_{q^m}(n) = 0\). Specifically, we derive that if \(n = 3\) or \(n = 2^d\) (where \(d\) is a nonnegative integer), then \(h_4(n) = 0\).</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kazuki Kannaka, Koichi Tojo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 72 pages, Comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study proper isometric actions of non-compact semisimple Lie groups on symmetric spaces in pseudo-Riemannian geometry. Motivated by Okuda's classification of semisimple symmetric spaces admitting proper $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$-actions [J. Differ. Geom., 2013], we focus on a family of symmetric spaces lying on the "boundary case" of the existence of proper $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$-actions. As a rigidity result, we show that any connected non-compact semisimple Lie group acting properly on this family must be globally isomorphic to $Spin(n,1)$ up to compact factors. Moreover, the largest value of $n$ for the existence of $Spin(n,1)$-proper actions is governed by the Hurwitz-Radon number. Our family includes the pseudo-Riemannian hyperbolic space $\mathbf{H}_{+}^{N,N-1}$ of signature $(N,N-1)$.</p></details>

We treat hypergeometric series over the rational numbers, over finite fields, and over the p-adics.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-02-04 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tianping Zhang, Mingxuan Zhong &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** In the prior version, omitting $C_0$ from Lemma 3.4 made the bound for $R_3(X)$ too large to conclude. Using a new truncated divisor function depending on prime factors yields six rather than two. Any comments or suggestions are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the Kloosterman sum $\text{Kl}(1,q)$ changes sign infinitely many times, as $q\rightarrow +\infty$ with at most six prime factors. As a consequence, our result improved the best known result of Xi(IMRN, 2022). The novelty of our method comes from introducing a new truncated divisor function whose selection depends on the number of prime factors of the variable, through which Kloosterman sum is controlled good enough. Our arguments contain the Selberg sieve method, spectral theory and distribution of Kloosterman sums along with previous nice works by Fouvry, Matomäki, Michel, Sivak-Fischler and Xi.</p></details>

> **Comment:** In Section 5 of the earlier version, there were some errors, which have now been corrected. Also, some additional results related to Schur P-functions are added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The flagged refined stable Grothendieck polynomials of skew shapes generalize several polynomials like stable Grothendieck polynomials, flagged skew Schur polynomials. In this paper, we provide a combinatorial expansion of the flagged refined skew stable Grothendieck polynomial in terms of key polynomials. We present this expansion by imposing a Demazure crystal structure on the set of flagged semi-standard set-valued tableaux of a given skew shape and a flag. We also provide expansions of the row-refined stable Grothendieck polynomials and refined dual stable Grothendieck polynomials and the Schur P-functions in terms of stable Grothendieck polynomials $G_λ$ and in terms of dual stable Grothendieck polynomials $g_λ$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Submitted to Notices of the AMS

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This expository article covers the recent developments surrounding Hilbert's tenth problem for finitely generated rings. We start by recounting the history of Hilbert's tenth problem over the integers, which was resolved negatively by Matiyasevich--Robinson--Davis--Putnam in 1970. In order to pass from $\mathbb{Z}$ to the finitely generated setting, we explain a criterion of Poonen that connects this to a problem in the theory of elliptic curves. Finally, we outline the main ideas behind the recent resolution of this elliptic curve problem by the authors.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 13 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a local average in the hyperbolic lattice point counting problem for the Picard group $Γ$ acting on the three-dimensional hyperbolic space. Compared to the pointwise case, we improve the bounds on the remainder in the counting, conditionally on a quantum variance estimate for Maass cusp forms attached to $Γ$. We also use bounds on a spectral exponential sum over the Laplace eigenvalues for $Γ$, which has been studied in the context of the prime geodesic theorem and for which unconditional bounds are known.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 49 pages, corrected Proposition 4.3, which affected Corollary 4.4, Proposition 4.5, and Theorem 4.6

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K = \mathbb{Q}(i)$. We study the Petersson inner product of a Hermitian Eisenstein series of Siegel type on the unitary group $U_{5}(K)$, diagonally-restricted on $U_2(K)\times U_2(K)\times U_1(K)$, against two Hermitian cuspidal eigenforms $F, G$ of degree $2$ and an elliptic cuspidal eigenform $h$ (seen as a Hermitian modular form of degree 1), all having weight $k \equiv 0 \pmod 4$. We obtain, through this consideration, an integral representation of a certain Dirichlet series, together with an additional residue term. By taking $F$ to belong in the Maass space, we are able to show that the Dirichlet series possesses an Euler product. Moreover, its $p$-factor for an inert prime $p$ can be essentially identified with the twist by $h$ of a degree six Euler factor attached to $G$ by Gritsenko. The question of whether the same holds for the primes that split remains unanswered here, even though we make considerable steps in that direction too. Our paper is inspired by a work of Heim, who considered a similar question in the case of Siegel modular forms.</p></details>

> **Comment:** arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2510.25276

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For semisimple Lie algebras, the BGG resolution is often viewed as a categorification of the Weyl character formula. For general linear Lie superalgebras, Brundan--Stroppel constructed an infinite resolution of the so-called Kostant simple modules by Kac modules, but their construction does not directly generalize the classical BGG resolution. In this paper we construct, for weights lying outside a neighborhood of the walls of the Weyl chambers, a resolution that categorifies a known Weyl-type finite-sum character formula in the same spirit as the Kac--Wakimoto formula. Our resolution is built from images of canonical homomorphisms between Verma modules attached to non-conjugate Borel subalgebras related by odd reflections. In particular, the construction developed here does generalize the classical BGG resolution.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 66 pages. Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Twisted $L$-functions by Dirichlet characters offer deep insights into arithmetic geometry, especially in the study of elliptic curves and abelian varieties over number fields. In the function field setting, Drinfeld modules and Anderson modules serve as analogues of elliptic curves and abelian varieties, and Goss $L$-series play the role of Hasse-Weil $L$-functions. This paper introduces a motivic framework for studying twisted Goss $L$-series via Anderson motives associated to Drinfeld modules and Artin representations. For a Drinfeld module and an Artin representation on the absolute Galois group, we present a construction of Anderson motives associated to them and we show that it comes from a uniformizable abelian Anderson module. We also study their associated $L$-series, which recover the norm of the twisted Goss $L$-values. These results provide an interpretation of twisted Goss $L$-values in terms of regulators of Anderson modules with the help of Taelman's class number formula.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $α\in \mathbb{R}$, let $$G_α:= \left< \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} , \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ α& 1 \end{bmatrix} \right> < \mathrm{SL}_2 (\mathbb{R}).$$ K. Kim and the first author established the orbit test, which provides a sufficient condition for $G_α$ not to be a rank-$2$ free group. In this article, we present two main applications of the orbit test. First, using the corresponding modulo homomorphism, we show that the converse of the orbit test does not hold. In particular, we construct explicit counterexamples, all of which are rational. As another application, we construct sequences of non-free rational numbers converging to $3$. These sequences are given by $$ 3 + \frac{3}{2 (9 n - 1)} \quad \text{and} \quad 3 + \frac{9 n + 5}{3 (2 n + 1) (9 n + 4)},$$ and their construction relies on the orbit test together with a modified Pell's equation.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Revised and reformulated throughout. The exposition now emphasizes the reduction to a function field cokernel model, and the manuscript has been updated (following an anonymous referee's suggestion) to appropriately credit prior related work of Cheong-Yu

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this note, we study the distribution of the rational canonical form of a random matrix over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$, whose entries are independent and $ε$-balanced with $ε\in(0,1-1/p]$. We show that, as the matrix size tends to infinity, the statistics converge to independent Cohen-Lenstra distributions, demonstrating the universality of this asymptotic behavior. In particular, we recover, as a special case, the uniform setting proved by Fulman in his thesis in 1997. Our proof uses the fact that the rational canonical form data of $A_n$ and the $\mathbb{F}_p[t]$-module structure of the function field cokernel $\Cok(tI_n-A_n)$ determine each other uniquely. Consequently, our question can be reformulated, equivalently, as the asymptotic distribution problem for this cokernel, which has been established by Cheong-Yu (arXiv:2303.09125).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a steganographic information hiding scheme based on structural properties of numerical semigroups arising from the Frobenius coin problem. Instead of encoding data through representable integers, the proposed protocol embeds information into the gap structure of carefully chosen symmetric numerical semigroups. Symmetry guarantees a balanced gap density, ensuring that encoded values are statistically indistinguishable from uniform numerical noise to an observer lacking the private generating set. The security of the scheme relies on the assumed average-case hardness of numerical semigroup membership inference for hidden generators, offering a novel number-theoretic primitive for covert communication and post-quantum resilient information hiding.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper, commissioned as a survey of the Riemann Hypothesis, provides a comprehensive overview of 165 years of mathematical approaches to this fundamental problem, while introducing a new perspective that emerged during its preparation. The paper begins with a detailed description of what we know about the Riemann zeta function and its zeros, followed by an extensive survey of mathematical theories developed in pursuit of RH -- from classical analytic approaches to modern geometric and physical methods. We also discuss several equivalent formulations of the hypothesis. Within this survey framework, we present an original contribution in the form of a "Letter to Riemann," using only mathematics available in his time. This letter reveals a method inspired by Riemann's own approach to the conformal mapping theorem: by extremizing a quadratic form (restriction of Weil's quadratic form in modern language), we obtain remarkable approximations to the zeros of zeta. Using only primes less than 13, this optimization procedure yields approximations to the first 50 zeros with accuracies ranging from $2.6 \times 10^{-55}$ to $10^{-3}$. Moreover we prove a general result that these approximating values lie exactly on the critical line. Following the letter, we explain the underlying mathematics in modern terms, including the description of a deep connection of the Weil quadratic form with the world of information theory. The final sections develop a geometric perspective using trace formulas, outlining a potential proof strategy based on establishing convergence of zeros from finite to infinite Euler products. While completing the commissioned survey, these new results suggest a promising direction for future research on Riemann's conjecture.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present an algorithm for computing the structure of any submodule of the module of points of a Drinfeld $A$-module over a finite field, where $A$ is a function ring over $\mathbb F_q$. When the function ring is $A = \mathbb F_q[T]$, we additionally compute a Frobenius decomposition of said submodule. Our algorithms apply in particular to kernels of isogenies and torsion submodules. They are presented within the frameworks of Frobenius normal forms, presentations of modules, and Fitting ideals. They rely largely on efficient and classical linear algebra methods, combined with fast arithmetic of Ore polynomials. We analyze the complexity of our algorithms, explore optimizations, and provide an implementation in SageMath. Finally, we compute a simple invariant attached to a Drinfeld $\mathbb F_q[T]$-module that encodes all the polynomials in $\mathbb F_q[T]$ whose associated torsion is rational.</p></details>

Similar results are shown for the coinduction functors attached to coalgebra morphisms in a monoidal category. As an application, we study the semiseparability of combinations of (co)induction functors in the context of duoidal categories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>One of the starting points of this work was the duality of Borcea relating standard level $k$ representations of $A_1^{(1)}$ and level $2k+1$ of $A_2^{(2)}$. For $k=1$ the combinatorial bases in both cases yield the two Capparelli identities and we wanted to see if there is a correspondence between the bases in terms of partitions for all $k\in\mathbb N$. By using the vertex operator relations in the principal picture for level $5$ standard $A_2^{(2)}$-modules we reduce a spanning set of Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt-type vectors in $L(5Λ_0)$ by removing the leading terms of relations and rendering a list of 34 ``difference'' conditions for partitions.We have with computer programs sorted out the sets of partitions satisfying these conditions and formed the partial generating series which agrees with the principally specialized character for all powers of $q$ up to $41$. Although our list of leading terms is incomplete, our results show that the corresponding combinatorial identity for $L_{A_2^{(2)}}(5Λ_0)$ drastically differs from the one for the Borcea dual $L_{A_1^{(1)}}(2Λ_0)$.</p></details>

The Hilbert numerator of $k[S]$ determines normalized alternating syzygy power sums $K_p(S)$ encoding alternating power sums of syzygy degrees. Fel conjectured an explicit formula for $K_p(S)$, for all $p\ge 0$, in terms of the gap power sums $G_r(S)=\sum_{g\notin S} g^r$ and universal symmetric polynomials $T_n$ evaluated at the generator power sums $σ_k=\sum_i d_i^k$ (and $δ_k=(σ_k-1)/2^k$). We prove Fel's conjecture via exponential generating functions and coefficient extraction, solating the universal identities for $T_n$ needed for the derivation. The argument is fully formalized in Lean/Mathlib, and was produced automatically by AxiomProver from a natural-language statement of the conjecture.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 48 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Initiated in work by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten, the area known as $τ$-tilting theory plays a fundamental role in contemporary representation theory. In this paper we explore a higher-dimensional analogue of this theory, formulated with respect to the higher Auslander-Reiten translation $τ_d$. In particular, we associate to any functorially finite $d$-torsion class a maximal $τ_d$-rigid pair and a $(d+1)$-term silting complex. In the case $d=1$, the notions of maximal $τ_d$-rigid and support $τ$-tilting pairs coincide, and our theory recovers the classical bijections. However, the proof strategies for $d>1$ differ significantly. As an intermediate step, we prove that a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of a module category induces a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of the category of $(d+1)$-term complexes, producing novel examples of $d$-exact categories. We introduce the notion of a $d$-torsion class in the exact setup, and use this to obtain the aforementioned $(d+1)$-term silting complex. We moreover apply our theory to study $d$-APR tilting modules and slices. To illustrate our results, we provide explicit combinatorial descriptions of maximal $τ_d$-rigid pairs and $(d+1)$-term silting complexes for higher Auslander and higher Nakayama algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a real $m\times n$ matrix $\pmbξ$, we consider its sequence of best Diophantine approximation vectors $ \pmb{x}_i \in \mathbb{Z}^n, \, i =1,2,3, ... $, the sequences of its norms $X_i = \|\pmb{x}_i\|$ and the norms of remainders $L_i = \|\pmbξ\pmb{x}_i\|$. It is known that, in the cases $m=1$, bad approximability of $\pmbξ$ is equivalent to the boundedness of ratios $\frac{X_{i+1}}{X_i}$, while for $n=1$ bad approximability of $\pmbξ$ is equivalent to the boundedness of ratios $ \frac{L_i}{L_{i+1}}$. Moreover, carefully constructed example show that in the cases $m=1$ and $n=1$ boundedness of ratios $ \frac{L_i}{L_{i+1}}$ and $\frac{X_{i+1}}{X_i}$ respectively (the order of ratios changed), does not imply bad approximability of $\pmbξ$. In the present paper, we study the impact of the boundedness of ratios on Diophantine properties of $\pmbξ$, in particular, what restrictions it gives for Diophantine exponents $ω(\pmbξ)$ and $\hatω(\pmbξ)$. One of our particular results deals with the case $m=n=2$. We prove that for $2\times 2 $ matrices $\pmbξ$ boundedness of both ratios $ \frac{X_{i+1}}{X_i}, \frac{L_i}{L_{i+1}} $ implies inequality $\hatω(\pmbξ)\le \frac{4}{3}$ and that this result is optimal. Our methods combine parametric geometry of numbers as well as more classical tools.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This work investigates the invariance of the non-necessarily finite uniform dimension and related concepts for subextensions in skew polynomial rings \mbox{$ \mathbb{S}=R[ \mathbf{\mathrm{X}}; \mathbfα , \mathbfδ ]$} of bijective type over a well-ordered set of variables. When the coefficient ring has enough uniform left ideals, in the commuting variables case we show that classical results on this topic for polynomial rings extend to subextensions of skew Laurent polynomial rings \mbox{$ \mathbb{S}=R[ \mathbf{\mathrm{X}}^{\pm1}; \mathbfα]$}, generated over $R$ by any family of (standard) terms. The situation in the non-commuting variables context is more complex; easily formed polynomial-like subrings can behave very oddly from the ambient ring. We provide easy examples of a (semi)prime left Goldie skew polynomial ring of bijective type containing a monoid subring isomorphic to a free non-commutative polynomial ring. We then study the so-called subclass of \emph{essentially special subextensions} and obtain for them the preservation of the uniform dimension and related concepts.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages; minor changes; accepted by Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Originally motivated by connections to integrable systems, two natural subalgebras of the rational Cherednik algebra have been considered in the literature. The first is the subalgebra of all degree zero elements and the second is the Dunkl angular momentum subalgebra. In this article, we study the ring-theoretic and homological properties of these algebras. Our approach is to realise them as rings of invariants under the action of certain reductive subgroups of $\rm SL_2$. This allows us to describe their centres. Moreover, we show that they are Auslander-Gorenstein and Cohen-Macaulay and, at $t = 0$, give rise to prime PI-algebras whose PI-degree we compute. Since the degree zero subalgebra can be realized as the ring of invariants for the maximal torus $\rm T \subset SL_2$ and the action of this torus on the rational Cherednik algebra is Hamiltonian, we also consider its (quantum) Hamiltonian reduction with respect to $\rm T$. At $t = 1$, the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the spherical subalgebra is a filtered quantization of the quotient of the minimal nilpotent orbit closure $\overline{\mathcal O}_{\min}$ in ${\mathfrak gl}(n)$ by the reflection group $W$. At $t = 0$, we get a graded Poisson deformation of the symplectic singularity $\overline{\mathcal O}_{\min}/W$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v3 There was a mistake in Proposition 2.2. in the previous version. This forced us to change the statement of Proposition 2.2 and 3.3 and Corollary 4.3.2. Moreover, several minor changes have been made throughout the paper

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study two classes of $\ell$-modular standard modules of the general linear group. The first class is obtained by reducing existing standard modules over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$ to $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell$ with respect to their natural integral structure. The second class is obtained by studying the generic extension map of the cyclical quiver, which was motivated by the construction of certain monomial bases of quantum algebras. In the latter case we also manage to prove a modular version of the Langlands classification, similar to the work of Langlands and Zelevinsky over $\mathbb{C}$. We moreover compute the corresponding $\ell$-modular Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions and check that they agree with the $L$-functions of their $\mathrm{C}$-parameters constructed by Kurinczuk and Matringe.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study irreducible subvarieties of the universal hypersurface $\mathcal{X}/B$ of degree $d$ and dimension $n$. We prove that when $d$ is sufficiently large, a degree $kd$ subvariety $Z$ which dominates $B$ comes from intersection with a family of degree $k$ projective varieties parametrized by $B$. This answers a question raised independently by Farb and Ma. Our main tools consist of a Grassmannian technique due to Riedl and Yang, a theorem of Mumford-Roitman on rational equivalence of zero-cycles, and an analysis of Cayley-Bacharach conditions in the presence of a Galois action. We also show that the large degree assumption is necessary; for $d=3$, rational points are dense in $\text{Sym}^dX_{k(B)}$, and in particular are not collinear.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study arithmetic progressions of squares over quadratic extensions of number fields. Using a method inspired by an approach of Mordell, we characterize such progressions as quadratic points on a genus $5$ curve. Specifically, we determine the set of $K$-quadratic points on this curve under certain conditions on the base field $K$. Our main results rely on the algebraic properties of specific elliptic curves after performing a base change to suitable number fields. As a consequence, we establish that, under appropriate assumptions, any non-elementary arithmetic progression of five or six squares properly defined over a quadratic extension of $K$ must be of a specific form. Moreover, we prove the non-existence of such progressions of length greater than six under these assumptions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give sufficient conditions for cohomological flatness (in dimension 0) over discrete valuation rings, generalizing classical results of Raynaud in two different ways. The first is a higher dimensional generalization of Raynaud's numerical criteria, in both the variant for the multiplicity of the special fibre and that for the index of the generic fibre. The second is a logarithmic criterion: we show that, over a log regular base, a proper flat fs log smooth morphism is cohomologically flat in dimension 0. We apply this latter result to curves and torsors under abelian varieties with good reduction, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the log smoothness of their regular models over arbitrary discrete valuation rings.</p></details>

Initially, this integral is transformed into a Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum via contour integration. Subsequently, a function incorporating theta is defined. By employing the residue theorem, the mixed Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum with both hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine in the denominator is converted into a simpler Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum, which contains only hyperbolic cosine or hyperbolic sine in the denominator. The simpler Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum is then evaluated using Jacobi elliptic functions, Fourier series expansions, and Maclaurin series expansions. Ultimately, the result is expressed as a rational polynomial of Gamma and \sqrt{pi}.Additionally, the integral is related to the Barnes multiple zeta function, which provides an alternative method for its calculation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we define and study four families of Berndt-type integrals, called mixed Berndt-type integrals, which contain (hyperbolic) sine and cosine functions in the integrand function. Using contour integration, these integrals are first converted to some hyperbolic (infinite) sums of Ramanujan type, all of which can be calculated in closed form by comparing both the Fourier series expansions and the Maclaurin series expansions of certain Jacobi elliptic functions. These sums can be expressed as rational polynomials of $Γ(1/4)$ and $π^{-1}$ which give rise to the closed formulas of the mixed Berndt-type integrals we are interested in. Moreover, we also present some interesting consequences and illustrative examples. Additionally, we define a generalized Barnes multiple zeta function, and find a classic integral representation of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function. Furthermore, we give an alternative evaluation of the mixed Berndt-type integrals in terms of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function. Finally, we obtain some direct evaluations of rational linear combinations of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The endomorphism algebras of the permutation modules for transitive permutation groups, known as Hecke algebras, are fundamental objects in representation theory. While group algebras are known to be symmetric over any field, it is natural to ask whether this property extends to Hecke algebras. To study this, we introduce the new concepts of $p$-$S$-permutation groups (for a prime $p$) and $S$-permutation groups. A \emph{ $p$-$S$-permutation group} is a transitive permutation group whose associated Hecke algebra is symmetric over every field of characteristic $p$. An \emph{ $S$-permutation group} is a transitive permutation group that is a $p$-$S$-permutation group for all primes $p$. In this paper, we study Hecke algebras from a group-theoretical perspective and we show that several classes of permutation groups are $p$-$S$-permutation groups and $S$-permutation groups in our sense. This result represents a substantial extension of earlier work by Li and He. (Transform Groups, 30(4), 2025), and reframes the question of determining when the algebra \(\End_{KG}(KΩ)\) is symmetric within a more general theoretical framework.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a structural resolution to the exact evaluation of the partition function $p_k(n)$, addressing the limitations of traditional recursive and asymptotic methods. By introducing the Simplicial Successive Decomposition (SSD) framework, we demonstrate that the partition polytope $\mathcal{P}_{n,k}$ is not an arbitrary geometric object, but admits a rigid minimal unimodular triangulation into exactly $N_k = \binom{k}{2}$ simplices. This cardinality is determined by the positive root system of the $A_{k-1}$ Weyl chamber.We decompose Euler's generating function into a finite sum of simplicial rational transforms. By applying Brion's localization theorem and the negative binomial expansion, we derive an exact closed-form formula with $O(1)$ computational complexity. The validity of the model is confirmed through Ehrhart-Macdonald reciprocity, ensuring accuracy in the "Core Collapse" regime where the polytope's interior is empty and continuous volume approximations are inapplicable.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The paper introduces a partial integration map from the first Hochschild cohomology of any cohomologically unital A-infinity category over a field of characteristic zero to its derived Picard group. We discuss useful properties such as injectivity, naturality and the relation with the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. Based on the image of the integration map we propose a candidate for the identity component of the derived Picard group in the case of finite-dimensional graded algebras. As a first application of the integration map it is shown that the vanishing of its domain is a necessary condition for the uniqueness of lifts of equivalences from the homotopy category to the A-infinity-level. The final part contains applications to derived Picard groups of wrapped and compact Fukaya categories of cotangent bundles and their plumbings and an outlook on applications to derived Picard groups of partially wrapped Fukaya categories after Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich.</p></details>

Each of these is defined as the Hilbert nullcone of a polar module, the exotic Sp(2n)-module and the enhanced GL(n)-module, respectively. In this paper we conduct a detailed study of the geometry of these two modules, by introducing the Jordan stratification, simultaneously generalising classical results on the adjoint representation as well as the symmetric space associated to (gl(2n), sp(2n)).

We show that up to algebraic conjugacy these automorphisms are exactly the generalised deep holes, as introduced in arXiv:1910.04947, of the Niemeier lattice vertex operator algebras with the additional property that their orders are equal to those of the corresponding outer automorphisms. Together with the constructions in arXiv:1708.05990 and arXiv:1910.04947 this gives three different uniform constructions of these vertex operator algebras, which are related through 11 algebraic conjugacy classes in $\mathrm{Co}_0$. Finally, by considering the inverse orbifold constructions associated with the 226 short automorphisms, we give the first systematic proof of the result that each strongly rational, holomorphic vertex operator algebra $V$ of central charge 24 with non-zero weight-one space $V_1$ is uniquely determined by the Lie algebra structure of $V_1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study the problem of sampling random supersingular elliptic curves with unknown endomorphism rings. This task has recently attracted significant attention, as the secure instantiation of many isogeny-based cryptographic protocols relies on the ability to sample such ``hard'' curves. Existing approaches, however, achieve this only in a trusted-setup setting. We present the first provable quantum polynomial-time algorithm that samples a random hard supersingular elliptic curve with high probability.Our algorithm runs heuristically in $\tilde{O}\!\left(\log^{4}p\right)$ quantum gate complexity and in $\tilde{O}\!\left(\log^{13} p\right)$ under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. As a consequence, our algorithm gives a secure instantiation of the CGL hash function and other cryptographic primitives. Our analysis relies on a new spectral delocalization result for supersingular $\ell$-isogeny graphs: we prove the Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture, and we further provide numerical evidence for complete eigenvector delocalization; this theoretical result may be of independent interest. Along the way, we prove a stronger $\varepsilon$-separation property for eigenvalues of isogeny graphs than that predicted in the quantum money protocol of Kane, Sharif, and Silverberg, thereby removing a key heuristic assumption in their construction.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field and let $\mathcal{O}_K$ be its ring of integers. For an integral ideal $\mathfrak{n}$ of $\mathcal{O}_K$, let $Γ_0({\mathfrak{n}})$ be the congruence subgroup of level ${\mathfrak{n}}$ consisting of matrices in $\mathrm{GL}_2{\mathcal{O}_K}$ that are upper triangular mod ${\mathfrak{n}}$. In this paper, we discuss techniques to compute the space of Bianchi modular forms of level $Γ_0({\mathfrak{n}})$ as a Hecke module in the case where $K$ has arbitrary class group. Our algorithms and computations extend and complement those carried out for fields of class number $1$, $2$, and $3$ by the first author, and by his students Bygott and Lingham in unpublished theses. We give details and several examples for $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-17})$, whose class group is cyclic of order $4$, including a proof of modularity of an elliptic curve over this field. We also give an overview of the results obtained for a wide range of imaginary quadratic fields, which are tabulated in the L-functions and modular forms database (\href{https://www.lmfdb.org/}{LMFDB}).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Determining the explicit forms and modularity for string functions and branching coefficients for Kac--Moody algebras after Kac, Peterson, and Wakimoto is an important problem. For positive admissible-level string functions for the affine Kac--Moody algebra $A_{1}^{(1)}$, very little is known. Here we apply the notion of quasi-periodicity to a generalized Euler identity of Schilling and Warnaar for the affine Kac--Moody algebra $A_{1}^{(1)}$. For integral-level string functions the classical periodicity reduces the infinite sum of string functions in the generalized Euler identity to a finite sum of string functions with theta function coefficients. For admissible-level, we similarly reduce to an analogous finite sum of string functions, but we also gain an additional finite sum of the form \begin{equation*} \sum_{i}Φ_{i}(q)Ψ_{i}(q), \end{equation*} where the $Φ_i(q)$'s are modular and depend only on the spin and the $Ψ_{i}(q)$'s are (mixed) mock modular Hecke-type double-sums and depend only on the quantum number. For levels $1/2$, $1/3$, and $2/3$, we shall also see that the $Ψ_{i}(q)$'s give us families of mock theta conjecture-like identities for symmetric Hecke-type double-sums. Our work here focuses on evaluating the $Ψ_{i}(q)$'s, and our expressions utilize Ramanujan's second-order mock theta function $μ_2(q)$ and third-order mock theta functions $f_{3}(q)$, $ω_3(q)$, $ψ_{3}(q)$, and $χ_3(q)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a case study in semi-autonomous mathematics discovery, using Gemini to systematically evaluate 700 conjectures labeled 'Open' in Bloom's Erdős Problems database. We employ a hybrid methodology: AI-driven natural language verification to narrow the search space, followed by human expert evaluation to gauge correctness and novelty. We address 13 problems that were marked 'Open' in the database: 5 through seemingly novel autonomous solutions, and 8 through identification of previous solutions in the existing literature. Our findings suggest that the 'Open' status of the problems was through obscurity rather than difficulty. We also identify and discuss issues arising in applying AI to math conjectures at scale, highlighting the difficulty of literature identification and the risk of ''subconscious plagiarism'' by AI. We reflect on the takeaways from AI-assisted efforts on the Erdős Problems.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The d'Arcais numbers are the triangular array $\{A(2,n,k)\, :\, n=0,1,\dots,\, k=0,\dots,n\}$, such that $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{n} A(2,n,k) x^k z^n/n! = ((z;z)_{\infty})^{-x}$. The infinite $q$-Pochhammer symbol is $(q;q)_{\infty} = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1-q^n)$. Holding $k$ fixed and considering large $n$, we note that the ratio $k! A(2,n,k)/n!$ is asymptotic to $C(k) σ_{2k-1}(n)/n^k$ where the divisor sum function is $σ_p(n) = \sum_{d|n} d^p$ and $C(k) = (ζ(2))^k/(Γ(k) ζ(2k))$. This is a slightly generalized version of one of Ramanujan's formulas from his paper, ``On Certain Arithmetical Functions," and it is an immediate consequence of the more recent article of Oliver, Shreshta and Thorne. Heim and Neuhauser made a conjecture, that $A(2,n,k)/A(2,n,k-1)$ is greater than or equal to $A(2,n,k+1)/A(2,n,k)$, for $k=2,3,\dots$ and all $n$. The conjecture is false for $k=2$, and it is true for $k=3,4,\dots$ when $n$ is sufficiently large. We consider the Hardy-Ramanujan circle method as a heuristic step.</p></details>

Denoting the coefficients for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by the formula $P_n(z) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A(2,n,k) z^k/n!$, we prove that $k_n!

The large deviation rate function is the Legendre-Fenchel transform $g^*(-κ)$ where $g(κ) = f^{-1}(κ)$ for the function $f : (0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $f(y)= \ln(-\ln((e^{-y};e^{-y})_{\infty}))$.

Moreover, for a finite poset $P$, we prove that the incidence algebra of $P$ can be realized as the endomorphism algebra of a standard tilting object if and only if $P$ is either empty or has the maximum. We also study the behaviors of the corresponding poset under graded Morita equivalences and coverings of a Gorenstein tiled order. Finally, we classify Gorenstein tiled orders $A$ satisfying $|\mathbb{V}_A^{op}|\leq 3$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we examine the restriction of the metaplectic representation $π$ over a $p$-adic field $k$, $p\neq2$, of zero characteristic to an isotropic torus $S$ contained in the symplectic group. First we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the momentum map in order that $S$ be admissible, that is $π_{\vert S}$ decomposes with finite multiplicities. Let us say that a torus contained in the symplectic group is irreducible if its action on the symplectic space is irreducible over $k$. Then we examine the case when $S$ is a proper subtorus of a maximal irreducible torus $T$ in the symplectic group and give sufficient conditions on $T$ in order that $S$ never be admissible. When these conditions are not satisfied, we give examples of admissible proper tori of a maximal irreducible torus. Finally, for any admissible subtorus $S$ of a certain type of maximal irreducible torus, we compute the multiplicity of the unitary characters of $S$ appearing into $π_{\vert S}$. We also show that the multiplicity of such a character is equal to the volume of the symplectic reduction of the inverse image under the momentum map of a linear form associated to it.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Representation theory of Lie (super)algebras has attracted significant research interest for many years, especially due to its applications in theoretical physics; in this regard, the representation theory of affine Lie (super)algebras is of central importance. To characterize simple modules over affine Lie (super)algebras, it is necessary to study the cases of nonzero and critical levels separately. Although a vast amount of research has been done on the representation theory of affine Lie (super)algebras $\mathcal{L}$, investigations concerning general modules at the critical level remain limited. In all existing studies, the characterization of the modules under consideration is reduced to the characterization of modules over some subalgebras of $\mathcal{L}$. Depending on the structure of the original modules, these subalgebras -- and the corresponding modules -- have different natures some of which are already known, while others need to be studied separately. In this paper, we give a complete characterization of the modules over specific subalgebras $\mathcal{G}$ of a twisted affine Lie superalgebra $\mathcal{L}$ that arise in the study of general zero level simple finite weight $\mathcal{L}$-modules. In particular, in the special case that $\\mathcal{G} = \mathcal{L}$, we obtain a complete characterization of quasi-integrable $\mathcal{L}$-modules of level zero.</p></details>

This gives explicit constants in the uniform Mordell conjecture proposed by Mazur and proved by Vojta, Dimitrov-Gao-Habegger, and Kühne. The main body of this paper consists of two parts: Part I for arithmetic estimates and Part II for analytic estimates.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate a new family of cyclic septic fields $\{K_t\}_{t\in\mathbb{Z}}$ arising from the Hashimoto--Hoshi construction. For this family, we compute the discriminant explicitly and characterize their Pólya property under the condition that the polynomial $E(t) = t^{6} + 2t^{5} + 11t^{4} + t^{3} + 16t^{2} + 4t + 8$ takes fifth-power free values. We show that this family contains infinitely many non-Pólya fields for which the cardinality of the Pólya group is unbounded. We also establish that, assuming Bunyakovsky's conjecture for $E(t)$, this family contains infinitely many Pólya fields. We further show that, for any fixed positive integer $m$, there exist infinitely many blocks of $m$ consecutive fields in this family whose cardinality of the Pólya groups can be made arbitrarily large. Finally, we demonstrate that infinitely many fields in this family are non-monogenic with field index one.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that any arithmetic locally symmetric space is homotopy equivalent to a simplicial complex where the number of simplices is bounded linearly in the volume of the space. This settles a well-known conjecture of Gelander. The main technical ingredient, which is of independent interest, is a strengthened version of the Margulis' collar lemma for arithmetic locally symmetric spaces based on the height gap theorem of Breuillard, in which the Margulis constant is made linear in the degree of the trace field of the lattice.</p></details>
