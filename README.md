 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sebastian Opper &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe the (bigraded) Hochschild cohomology of graded gentle algebras along with the Gerstenhaber bracket and cup product. In particular, this yields a description of the Hochschild cohomology of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of surfaces in the sense of Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich which have at least one stop. Our results are an important ingredient in the author's recent description of the derived Picard group of partially wrapped Fukaya categories and graded gentle algebras. As another application we provide a characterisation of intrinsically formal graded gentle algebras under mild assumptions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Thang Pang Ern, Devandhira Wijaya Wangsa &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1914, Ramanujan presented a collection of 17 elegant and rapidly converging formulae for $π$. Among these, one of the most celebrated is the following series: $$\frac{1}π=\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{9801}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{26390n+1103}{\left(n!\right)^4} \frac{\left(4n\right)!}{396^{4n}}$$ In this paper, we give a full proof of this classic formula using hypergeometric series and a special type of lattice sums due to Zucker and Robertson. We will also use some results by Dirichlet and Edwards in algebraic number theory.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Lauren Grimley, Jonathan R. Kujawa &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 17 pages, Version 2 has various minor corrections and improvements to exposition

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be an associative superalgebra over a field of characteristic zero. Let $n \geq d+1$. The main result of the paper establishes an equivalence of categories between supermodules for the wreath product $ S_{d} \wr A$ and an explicitly defined category of supermodules for the general linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_{n}(A)$. We also give an example showing the bound $n \geq d+1$ cannot be improved.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Thomas Decru, Sabrina Kunzweiler &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a new method for the computation of $(3,3)$-isogenies between principally polarized abelian surfaces. The idea is to work with models in $\mathbb{P}^8$ induced by a symmetric level-$3$ theta structure. In this setting, the action of three-torsion points is linear, and the isogeny formulas can be described in a simple way as the composition of easy-to-evaluate maps. In the description of these formulas, the relation with the Burkhardt quartic threefold plays an important role. Furthermore, we discuss generalizations of the idea to higher dimensions as well as different isogeny degrees.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Luca Ferrigno &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 45 pages. Comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $S$ be a smooth irreducible curve over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, and let $\mathcal{A} \to S$ be an abelian scheme with a curve $C \subset \mathcal{A}$, both defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. In 2020, Barroero and Capuano proved that if $C$ is not contained in a proper subgroup scheme, then the intersection of $C$ with the union of the flat subgroup schemes of $\mathcal{A}$ of codimension at least 2 is finite. In this article, we continue to study this problem by considering the intersections with the algebraic subgroups of the CM fibers, generalizing a previous result of Barroero for fibered powers of elliptic schemes. A key ingredient of the proof is an explicit control of canonical heights under endomorphisms: for an abelian variety $A/\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, an ample symmetric divisor $D$, and $f \in \mathrm{End}(A)$, we bound explicitly $\widehat{h}_{A, D}(f(P))$ in terms of $\widehat{h}_{A, D}(P)$ by determining the values of $λ\in \mathbb{R}$ for which the divisors $λD - f^* D$ and $f^* D - λD$ are ample.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05915v1'>2601.05915</a>\]&nbsp; **The Lyapunov spectrum for Schneider map on $p\mathbb{Z}_p$**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Matias Alvarado, Nicolás Arévalo-Hurtado &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DS &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the thermodynamic formalism associated with the Schneider map on the p-adic integers $p\mathbb{Z}_p$ . By introducing a geometric potential that captures the expansion of cylinder sets generated by the map, we define a Lyapunov exponent adapted to this non-Archimedean setting. We investigate the corresponding Lyapunov spectrum and show that it is real analytic on its natural domain. Moreover, we obtain an explicit closed formula for the spectrum. As a consequence, we recover and refine known results on the Hausdorff dimension of sets defined by a prescribed asymptotic arithmetic mean of the continued fraction digits. Finally, we relate the Lyapunov exponent to the exponential rate of convergence of rational approximations arising from truncations of the Schneider continued fraction expansion. This provides a $p$-adic analogue of classical results from Diophantine approximation and yielding precise dimension formulas for the associated level sets.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05888v1'>2601.05888</a>\]&nbsp; **The low degree cohomology of compactifications of $A_g$**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Samir Canning, Dan Petersen, Olivier Taïbi &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 31 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the low degree $\ell$-adic intersection cohomology of symplectic local systems on the Satake compactification of the moduli space $A_g$ of principally polarized abelian varieties. We prove that only a small finite list of irreducible Galois representations can appear in the low degree cohomology of any nonsingular toroidal compactification of $A_g$ or $X_{g,s}$, the $s$-fold fiber product of the universal abelian variety. We give several applications, including to spaces of holomorphic forms on toroidal compactifications and to the cohomology of the interior. In particular, we give a complete characterization of when the cohomology of $X_{g,s}$, or one of its toroidal compactifications, is of Tate type. The result is independent of the choice of toroidal compactification.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Vytautas Paškūnas, Julian Quast &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 17 pages. Revised version after the referee report. Minor changes

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that deformation rings $R^{\mathrm{ps}}$ of $G$-pseudocharacters of a profinite group $Γ$ are noetherian, when $Γ$ satisfies Mazur's finiteness condition. The proof proceeds by reduction to the case when $Γ$ is finitely generated, where the result was previously established by the second author. This enables us to extend our work on moduli spaces of $R^{\mathrm{ps}}$-condensed representations of a finitely generated profinite group $Γ$, to the groups satisfying Mazur's finiteness condition. We also show that the functor from rigid analytic spaces over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ to sets, which associates to a rigid space $Y$ the set of continuous $\mathcal{O}(Y)$-valued $G$-pseudocharacters of $Γ$ is representable by a quasi-Stein rigid analytic space, and we study its general properties. We expect these results to be useful, when studying global Galois representations.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Chongyao Chen, Kirsten Wickelgren &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Accepted for publication in the proceedings of Regulators V

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute an analogue of Pascal's triangle enriched in bilinear forms over a finite field. This gives an arithmetically meaningful count of the ways to choose $j$ ring homomorphisms into an algebraic closure from an étale extension of degree $n$. We also compute a quadratic twist. These (twisted) enriched binomial coefficients are defined in joint work of Brugallé and the second-named author, building on work of Serre. Such binomial coefficients support curve counting results over non-algebraically closed fields, using $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 105 pages. Revised version after the referee report. Minor changes. Added an index of notations

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study deformation theory of mod $p$ Galois representations of $p$-adic fields with values in generalised reductive group schemes, such as $L$-groups and $C$-groups. We show that the corresponding deformation rings are complete intersections of expected dimension. We determine their irreducible components in many cases and show that they and their special fibres are normal and complete intersection.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** André Unterberger &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** With the help of the results obtained in the disproof of the Riemann hypothesis, one gives a rather short proof of the Lindel\öf hypothesis

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Weyl symbolic calculus of operators leads to the construction, if one takes for symbol a certain distribution decomposing over the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, of an operator with the following property: the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the validity of a collection of estimates involving this operator. Pseudodifferential arithmetic, a novel chapter of pseudodifferential operator theory, makes it possible to make the operator under study fully explicit. This leads to a disproof of the conjecture: the set of real parts of non-trivial zeros of zeta is a dense subset of [0,1]. The same methods lead to a proof of the Lindel"of hypothesis.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Or Ordentlich &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** cs.IT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a lattice/linear code, we define the Voronoi spherical cumulative density function (CDF) as the CDF of the $\ell_2$-norm/Hamming weight of a random vector uniformly distributed over the Voronoi cell. Using the first moment method together with a simple application of Jensen's inequality, we develop lower bounds on the expected Voronoi spherical CDF of a random lattice/linear code. Our bounds are valid for any finite dimension and are quite close to a trivial ball-based lower bound. They immediately translate to new non-asymptotic upper bounds on the normalized second moment and the error probability of a random lattice over the additive white Gaussian noise channel, as well as new non-asymptotic upper bounds on the Hamming distortion and the error probability of a random linear code over the binary symmetric channel. In particular, we show that for most lattices in $\mathbb{R}^n$ the second moment is greater than that of a Euclidean ball with the same covolume only by a $\left(1+O(\frac{1}{n})\right)$ multiplicative factor. Similarly, for most linear codes in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ the expected Hamming distortion is greater than that of a corresponding Hamming ball only by an additive universal constant.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Lemma 3.1 in the previous version was not correct, and this left a gap in the proof of Statement 1 of Theorem 1.1. This version fixes Lemma 3.1 and thereby removes the gap

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the geometry of some proper 4-colorings of the vertices of sphere triangulations with degree sequence 6,...,6,2,2,2. Such triangulations are the simplest examples which have non-negative combinatorial curvature. The examples we construct, which are roughly extremal in some sense, are based on a novel geometric interpretation of continued fractions. We also present a conjectural sharp "isoperimetric inequality" for colorings of this kind of triangulation.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 11 pages

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Tom De Medts, Louis Olyslager &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 23 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2021, Maurice Chayet and Skip Garibaldi provided an explicit construction of a commutative non-associative algebra on the second smallest representation of $E_8$ (of dimension $3875$) adjoined with a unit. In fact, they define such an algebra $A(\mathfrak{g})$ for each simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, in terms of explicit but ad-hoc formulas. We discovered that their algebras $A(\mathfrak{g})$ have a natural interpretation in terms of affine vertex algebras, and their ad-hoc formulas take an extremely simple form in this new interpretation. It is our hope that this point of view will lead to a better understanding of this interesting class of algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, there has been a lot of work on combinatorial inequalities related to hook-lengths in $t$-regular partitions. In this short note, we give a proof using generating functions for a result proved by Singh and Barman (2026) using combinatorial methods. In addition, we give an alternate proof of another result of Singh \& Barman (2024) which yields as a corollary a previously unobserved connection of hook-lengths in $t$-regular partitions with certain distinct parts partitions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 11 pages, accepted in Boletín de la Sociedad Matemática Mexicana

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, the concept of parity bias in integer partitions has been studied by several authors. We continue this study here, but for non-unitary partitions (namely, partitions with parts greater than $1$). We prove analogous results for these restricted partitions to those that have been obtained by Kim, Kim, and Lovejoy (2020) and Kim and Kim (2021). We also look at inequalities between two classes of partitions studied by Andrews (2019), where the parts are separated by parity (either all odd parts are smaller than all even parts or vice versa).</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zilong He &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the paper, we mainly determine the structures, counting formulas, and density sets of representations for binary and ternary ADC quadratic lattices over arbitrary non-archimedean local fields. In the binary case, we show that under certain conditions, there are finitely many primitive positive definite ADC lattices and infinitely many non-primitive ones. We also provide concise formulas for local densities and masses using invariants from BONGs theory, and show that these invariants completely determine the local densities over arbitrary non-archimedean local fields. Moreover, we compute the corresponding local quantities for ADC lattices over algebraic number fields. In the ternary case, we characterize the codeterminant set of spinor exceptions and integral spinor norm groups for ADC lattices over arbitrary non-archimedean local fields. Based on these results, we further establish some sufficient conditions on indefinite ADC lattices over algebraic number fields.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 30 pages. To appear in Linear Algebra and its Applications

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The aim of this paper is to define and study the constructions of alternating and symmetric (super)powers of metric generalized Jordan (super)pairs. These constructions are obtained by transference via the Faulkner construction. The construction of tensor (super)products for metric generalized Jordan (super)pairs is revisited. We always assume that the characteristic of the base field $\mathbb{F}$ is different from $2$; in case of positive characteristic, sometimes we require that the characteristic is large enough to allow nondegeneracy of certain bilinear forms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The sequence $$ \mathbb{P}^{(c)}=(\lfloor p^c \rfloor)_{p\in \mathbb{P}}\quad (c>0,c\notin \mathbb{N}), $$ is an important subsequence of the well-known Piatetski-Shapiro sequence, where $\mathbb{P}$ is the set of prime numbers and $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ is the floor function. We prove that for all $c \in (0, 13/15)$, any large enough integer $N$ can be represented as $$ N=\lfloor p^c\rfloor+q, $$ where $p$ and $q$ are primes. We also prove the result holds for almost all fixed positive $c \in \mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Z}$. Moreover, we investigate shifted primes in this sequence, obtaining an asymptotic formula for all $c \in (0, 13/15)$ and an almost-all result for fixed positive $c \in \mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Z}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 12 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>About a century ago, P. A. MacMahon introduced a class of $q$-series, which are nowadays referred to as MacMahon series. More recently, in 2013, G. E. Andrews and S. C. F. Rose revealed the quasimodular property of these series. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of MacMahon series. Specifically, for any positive integers $t, k, N$ and a polynomial $Q(x)$, we define the series $\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}(Q; q)$ and $\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}^{\star}(Q; q)$ using the $N$-th cyclotomic polynomial. To investigate these series, we apply a decomposition formula involving the Eulerian polynomials and express the $N$-th roots of unity in terms of Gauss sums. By combining these results to derive explicit representations, we prove that our series arise as quasimodular forms of higher weight and higher level. Furthermore, we show that they can be expressed as isobaric polynomials. In particular, we show that the one-parameter generalization introduced by C. Nazaroglu, B. V. Pandey, and A. Singh arises as a special case of our theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We initiate a program aimed at classifying thick ideals, Balmer spectra, and submodule categories of various stable categories of bimodules and modules for finite dimensional selfinjective algebras, and at clarifying the relationship between the universal Balmer support and the Hochschild cohomology support. In this paper, we focus mostly on the case of a unipotent Hopf algebra $A$. The stable category $\underline{\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\mathsf{env}})$ of $A$-bimodules that are projective as left and as right $A$-modules is a monoidal triangulated category under $\otimes_A$, and acts naturally on the stable category $\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A)$ of $A$. We show in this case that the Balmer spectrum $\mathsf{Spc}(\mathcal{E})$ of the thick subcategory ${\mathcal E}$ of $\underline{\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\mathsf{env}})$ generated by $A$ is homeomorphic to $\mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A))$ and defines an embedding $\mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A)) \to \mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A^{\mathsf{env}}))$. Subject to a conjectural description of spectra of finite tensor categories, we show that the spectrum of ${\mathcal E}$ is homeomorphic to ${\mathsf{Proj}}$ of the Hochschild cohomology ring of $A$, and that the Hochschild support coincides with the universal Balmer support. We show that any subcategory ${\mathcal K}$ of $\underline{\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\mathsf{env}})$ containing a thick generator admits a surjective continuous map from $\mathsf{Spc}(\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A))$. As a consequence, under the aforementioned conjecture, this spectrum is Noetherian, classifies the thick ideals of ${\mathcal K}$, and classifies thick ${\mathcal K}$-submodule categories of $\underline{\mathsf{mod}}(A)$ via the Stevenson module-theoretic support. As examples, we present in detail the representations of finite $p$-groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(\mathbf{U}, \mathbf{U}^\imath)$ be a quasi-split affine quantum symmetric pair of type $\mathsf{AIII}$. This case is of particular interest thanks to the existence of geometric realizations and Schur--Weyl dualities. We establish factorization and coproduct formulae for the Drinfeld--Cartan series $\boldsymbolΘ_i(z)$ in the Lu--Pan--Wang--Zhang `new Drinfeld'-style presentation, generalizing the split type results from [Prz23, LP25a].

> **Comment:** Submitted to the International Journal of Number Theory. 14 pages. Minor clarifications; no change to results

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove explicit Erdős--Wintner bounds for Cantor numeration systems via a simple trailing-window decomposition. We temporarily discard the last block of digits (the ``window'') and analyze the remaining prefix. The resulting bound has three contributions: (i) a bridge loss from discarding the window; (ii) a variance-type tail for the prefix; and (iii) a regime-dependent smoothing term (Esseen, bounded density, or cancellation of the third cumulant). Optimizing the window length yields rates that are explicit in the sample size. In the fixed-base (q-adic) case we recover Delange's product and obtain effective convergence bounds; the same scheme applies unchanged to Cantor numeration systems. We also include a brief guide indicating when each regime is preferable.</p></details>

Using formal power series, we then give two algebraic semiformal proofs of this result.

The second proof uses improper integrals of formal power series and is due to this author.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We take first steps toward a theory of ``conformal twists'' for superconformal field theories in dimension 3 to 6, extending the well-known analysis of twists for supersymmetric theories. A conformal twist is a square-zero odd element in the superconformal Lie algebra, and we classify all twists and describe their orbits under the adjoint action of the superconformal group. We work mostly with the complexified superconformal algebras, unless explicitly stated otherwise; real forms of the superconformal algebra may have important physical implications, but we only discuss these subtleties in a few special cases. Conformal twists can give rise to interesting subalgebras and protected sectors of operators in a superconformal field theory, with the Donaldson--Witten topological field theory and the vertex operator algebras of 4-dimensional N=2 SCFTs being prominent examples. To obtain mathematical precision, we explain how to extract vertex algebras and E_n algebras from a twisted superconformal field theory using factorization algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we employ contour integration and residue calculus to derive explicit parity formulas for (cyclotomic) multiple zeta values (MZVs). A key innovation lies in applying double shuffle regularization to the contour integrals, which leads to two distinct regularized parity formulas-one via shuffle and one via stuffle regularization. Notably, this demonstrates for the first time that the contour integral method can be extended to the regularized setting (including the case $k_r=1$), thereby overcoming a limitation of previous approaches. Our results not only provide explicit parity relations at arbitrary depths but also lay the groundwork for extending this technique to other variants of multiple zeta values.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In his breakthrough article, Darmon presented a program to study Generalized Fermat Equations (GFE) via abelian varieties of $\text{GL}_2$-type over totally real fields. So far, only Jacobians of some Frey hyperelliptic curves have been used with that purpose. In the present article, we show how most of the known Frey hyperelliptic curves are particular instances of a more general biparametric family of hyperelliptic curves $C(z,s)$. Then, we apply the cluster picture methodology to compute the conductor of $C(z,s)$ at all odd places. As a Diophantine application, we specialize $C(z,s)$ in some particular values $z_0$ and $s_0$, and we find the conductor exponent at odd places of the natural Frey hyperelliptic curves attached to $Ax^p+By^p=Cz^r$ and $Ax^r+By^r=Cz^p$, generalizing the results due to Azon, Curcó-Iranzo, Khawaja, Maistret and Mocanu, and opening the door for future research in GFE with coefficients. Moreover, we show how a new Frey hyperelliptic curve for $Ax^2+By^r=Cz^p$ can be constructed in this way, giving new results on the conductor exponents for this equation. Finally, following the recent approach by Golfieri and Pacetti, we consider the Frey representations attached to a general signature $(q,r,p)$ via hypergeometric motives and, using $C(z,s)$, we compute the wild part of the conductor exponent at primes above $q$ and $r$ of the residual representation modulo a prime above $p$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X\subseteq \mathbb{P}^3$ be a smooth projective surface of degree $d\ge 4$ defined over a number field $K$, and let $N_{X^{\prime}}(B)$ be the number of rational points of $X$ of height at most $B$ that do not lie on lines contained in $X$. Assuming a suitable hypothesis on the size of the rank of Abelian varieties, we show that $N_{X^{\prime}}(B)\ll_{K,d,\varepsilon} B^{4/3+\varepsilon}$ for any fixed $\varepsilon>0$. This improves an unconditional bound from Salberger for $d=4$ and $d=5$. The proof, based on an argument of Heath-Brown, consists of cutting $X$ by projective planes and using a uniform version of Faltings's Theorem, due to Dimitrov, Gao, and Habegger, to bound the number of rational points on the plane sections of $X$. More generally, we prove that if $X\subseteq \mathbb{P}^n$ is a non-degenerate non-uniruled smooth projective surface defined over $K$, then $N_{X^{\prime}}(B)\ll_{K,n,d,\varepsilon}B^{\frac{n+1}{n}+\varepsilon}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the present paper we study the central values of additive twists of Maaß forms $L$-series. In the case of the modular group, we show that the additive twists (when averaged over denominators) are asymptotically normally distributed. This supplements the recent work of Petridis--Risager which settled an averaged version of a conjecture of Mazur--Rubin concerning modular symbols. The methods of the present paper combine dynamical input due to Bettin and the first named author with the new fact that the additive twists define quantum modular forms in the sense of Zagier. This latter property is shown for a general discrete, co-finite group with cusps. Our results also has a number of arithmetic applications; in the case of Hecke congruence groups the quantum modularity implies certain reciprocity relations for twisted moments of twisted ${\rm GL}_2$-automorphic $L$-functions, extending results of Conrey and the second named author. In the case of cuspidal Maaß forms for the modular group, we also obtain a calculation of certain wide moments of twists of the $L$-function of the Maaß form.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this study, we introduce the theory of what we call Hecke vector-forms. A Hecke vector-form can be viewed as a vector function representation of some quasiautomorphic form that transforms like an automorphic form on an arbitrarily chosen Hecke triangle group. In other words, because quasiautomorphic forms have complicated transformation behavior when compared with automorphic forms, the construction of a Hecke vector-form is to retrieve a transformation behavior analogous to the simpler, automorphic case. In this way, a Hecke vector-form can be viewed as the vector function analogue of an automorphic form. Since our work is for any quasi-automorphic form over an arbitrary Hecke triangle group, we briefly review the construction of such groups. Furthermore, we review the derivation of the hauptmodul, the automorphic forms, and the normalized quasiautomorphic form of weight 2 for any Hecke triangle group. We then proceed to the theory of Hecke vector-forms and establish the desired transformation behavior with respect to the generators of the associated group. A proof of this fact is strictly elementary, relying on fine properties of binomial coefficients. Lastly, we relate the vector-forms to Hecke automorphic linear differential equations, which are analogues of the frequently researched modular linear differential equations. Our results include Hecke vector-forms of the classical quasimodular forms as the simplest case.</p></details>

We prove a sharp local-to-global principle: for each $p^e\!\parallel n$, the local shape at $p$ is determined by $a\bmod p^{\,e+1}$, and this precision is optimal.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the distribution of $2$-torsion in class groups and narrow class groups of cubic fields and cubic orders subject to prescribed shape conditions. The \emph{shape} of a cubic order in a number field is a natural geometric invariant taking values in the modular surface $\mathbb{H}/\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. Fix a subset $W$ of the modular surface with positive hyperbolic measure and boundary of measure zero. Refining the methods of Bhargava and Varma, we prove that among cubic fields with shape in $W$, the average size of the $2$-torsion subgroup of the class group is $5/4$ for totally real fields and $3/2$ for complex fields, while the average size of the $2$-torsion subgroup of the narrow class group for totally real cubic fields is $2$. We also obtain analogous results for cubic orders satisfying prescribed local conditions at all primes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Representations of vertex operator algebras $V$ (VOAs) have numerous applications, including the construction of sheaves of conformal blocks on moduli spaces of curves. For a $V$-module $W = \oplus W_d$, a sequence of associative algebras $\mathfrak{A}_d$ acts on each graded component $W_d$. When these $d$th-mode transition algebras $\mathfrak{A}_d$ are strongly unital - meaning they are unital with units acting as the identity on $W_d$ - the associated sheaves of conformal blocks are vector bundles rather than merely coherent sheaves. This strong unital property, while difficult to verify in practice, has other important implications as well. Here we construct explicit strong units for $L_{\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}(1,0)$, the simple affine VOA for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at level $1$, and establish that mode transition algebras for universal affine VOAs for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ are never strongly unital at any level $k$ not equal to the critical level $-2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide an affine cellular structure on the extended affine Hecke algebra and affine $q$-Schur algebra of type $A_{n-1}$ that is defined over $\mathbb{Z}\left[q^{\pm1}\right]$, that is, without an adjoined $q^{\frac{1}{2}}$. This is with an eye to applications in the representation theory of $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$ for a $p$-adic field $F$ over coefficient rings in which $p$ is invertible but does not have a square root, which have been a topic of recent interest. This is achieved via a renormalisation of the known affine cellular structure over $\mathbb{Z}\left[q^{\pm\frac{1}{2}}\right]$ at each left and right cell, which is chosen to ensure that the diagonal intersections remain subalgebras and that the left and right cells remain isomorphic. We furthermore show that the affine cellular structure on the Schur algebra has idempotence properties which imply finite global dimension, an important ingredient for the applications to representations of $p$-adic groups.</p></details>

The criterion for the uniqueness of the number representation is established. It is proved that the Hausdorff--Besicovitch dimension of the set of numbers with a unique representation is equal to $\frac{\ln(2s-r-1)}{\ln s}$. An analysis of the quantity of representations of numbers having purely periodic representations with a simple period (a single-digit period) is carried out. It is proved that the set of numbers that admit a continuum of distinct representations has full Lebesgue measure. Conditions for a number to belong to this set are given in terms of one of its representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Geometric and Topological Deep Learning are rapidly growing research areas that enhance machine learning through the use of geometric and topological structures. Within this framework, Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) have emerged as a powerful class of operators for encoding symmetries and designing efficient, interpretable neural architectures. Originally introduced in Topological Data Analysis, GENEOs have since found applications in Deep Learning as tools for constructing equivariant models with reduced parameter complexity. GENEOs provide a unifying framework bridging Geometric and Topological Deep Learning and include the operator computing persistence diagrams as a special case. Their theoretical foundations rely on group actions, equivariance, and compactness properties of operator spaces, grounding them in algebra and geometry while enabling both mathematical rigor and practical relevance. While a previous representation theorem characterized linear GENEOs acting on data of the same type, many real-world applications require operators between heterogeneous data spaces. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a new representation theorem for linear GENEOs acting between different perception pairs, based on generalized T-permutant measures. Under mild assumptions on the data domains and group actions, our result provides a complete characterization of such operators. We also prove the compactness and convexity of the space of linear GENEOs.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove an equivalence between filtrations of primitive bialgebras and filtrations of factorizable perverse sheaves, generalizing the results obtained by Kapranov-Schechtman. Under this equivalence, we find that the word length filtration of quantum shuffle algebras as defined in Ellenberg-Tran-Westerland corresponds to the codimension filtration of factorizable perverse sheaves. Furthermore, we find that the geometric weight filtration of factorizable perverse sheaves corresponds to a filtration on quantum shuffle algebras which has not been previously defined in the literature, and we call this the algebraic weight filtration. To apply this to Hurwitz spaces, we prove a comparison theorem between the weight filtrations for Hurwitz spaces over $\mathbb F_p$ and $\mathbb C$, generalizing the comparison theorem of Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland. This allows us to determine the cohomological weights for Hurwitz spaces explicitly using the algebraic weight filtration of the corresponding quantum shuffle algebra. As a consequence, we find that most weights of Hurwitz spaces are smaller than expected from cohomological degree, and we prove explicit nontrivial upper bounds for weights in some cases, such as when $G=S_3$ and $c$ is the conjugacy class of transpositions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A weight $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$-module with finite-dimensional weight spaces is called a cuspidal module, if every root vector of $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$ acts injectively on it. In \cite{LL}, it has been shown that any block with a generalized central character of the cuspidal $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$-module category is equivalent to a block of the category of finite-dimensional modules over the minimal nilpotent finite $W$-algebra $W(e)$ for $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$. In this paper, using a centralizer realization of $W(e)$ and an explicit embedding $W(e)\rightarrow U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$, we show that every finite-dimensional irreducible $W(e)$-module is isomorphic to an irreducible $W(e)$-quotient module of some finite-dimensional irreducible $\mathfrak{gl}_n$-module. As an application, we can give very explicit realizations of all irreducible cuspidal $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$-modules using finite-dimensional irreducible $\mathfrak{gl}_n$-modules, avoiding using the twisted localization method and the coherent family introduced in \cite{M}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the first moment of cubic Hecke $L$-functions over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ evaluated at any $s$ inside the critical strip. The first moment for $s<\frac{1}{2}$ is particularly interesting, and we show there is a phase transition at $s=\frac{1}{3}$. This extends the analogue result of David-Meisner for the first moment over function fields. As in their work, the computation of the moment at $s=\frac{1}{3}$ relies on a cancellation between two terms which are a priori not related: a main term of the principal sum which comes from cubes, and the contribution from infinitely many residues of Dirichlet series of cubic Gauss sums to the dual sum. The cancellation also improves the error term and exhibits a secondary term for all $s$. In particular, at $s=\frac{1}{2}$, we prove the existence of a secondary term of size $Q^{5/6}$, where the size of the family is $Q$. We conjecture that a similar behaviour would hold for higher order Hecke $L$-functions attached to $\ell^{th}$ order residue symbols, refining a function field conjecture of David and Meisner. The proof follows the steps of writing $L(s,χ)$ as two finite sums with the approximate functional equation. Two main ingredients are then exploited: the bound on the second moment of $L(1/2+it,χ)$ that follows from Heath-Brown's cubic large sieve, and the deep work of Kubota and Patterson which connects the Dirichlet series of cubic Gauss sums to metaplectic forms, and gives a formula for its residues in terms of the Fourier coefficients of metaplectic theta functions. This is only known for cubic Gauss sums, and not for general Gauss sums of order $\ell\geq 4$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Ramanujan's original definition of mock theta functions from 1920 involves their asymptotic behaviors at roots of unity on the boundary of the disk of convergence $|q|<1$. More recently this topic has been related by several authors, including the first author with Ono and Rhoades in 2013, to quantum modular forms, first defined in 2010 by Zagier. In 2021, Lovejoy defined and studied related quantum $q$-series identities, which do not hold as equalities between power series inside the disk $|q|<1$ but which do hold on dense subsets of roots of unity on the boundary. Inspired by this, in our prior joint work from 2024 we further studied quantum $q$-series identities as related to mock theta functions and quantum modular forms; we also defined and studied antiquantum $q$-series identities, between series which are equal inside the disk $|q|<1$ but which hold at dense sets of roots of unity on the boundary for which one of the series diverges and is unnaturally truncated. Here, building from our previous work, we establish antiquantum $q$-series identities for all of Ramanujan's third order mock theta functions. We deduce these results in part by establishing and applying more general identities which are also of independent interest, and by using the theory of modular eta-quotients.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the curves $y^2=x^{2^m} -1$ and $y^2=x^{2^{d}+1}-x$ over the rationals.

One of the principal aims of this paper is to fully describe their Sato-Tate groups and distributions by determining generators of the component groups. In order to do this, we first prove the nondegeneracy of the two families of Jacobian varieties via their Hodge groups. We then use results relating Sato-Tate groups and twisted Lefschetz groups of nondegenerate abelian varieties to determine the generators of the associated Sato-Tate groups. The results of this paper add new examples to the literature of families of nondegenerate Jacobian varieties and of noncyclic component groups of Sato-Tate groups. Furthermore, we compute moment statistics associated to the Sato-Tate groups which can be used to verify the equidistribution statement of the generalized Sato-Tate conjecture by comparing them to moment statistics obtained for the traces in the normalized $L$-polynomials of the curves.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we generalize the following problem, which is called the rational angle bisection problem, to the $n$-dimensional space $k^n$ over a subfield $k$ of $\mathbb R$: on the coordinate plane, for which rational numbers $a$ and $b$ are the slopes of the angle bisectors between two lines with slopes $a$ and $b$ rational? First, we give a few characterizations of when the angle bisectors between two lines with direction vectors in $k^n$ have direction vectors in $k^n.$ To find solutions to the problem in the case when $k = \mathbb Q,$ we also give a formula for the integral solutions of $x_1{}^2+\dots +x_n{}^2 = dx_{n+1}{}^2,$ which is a generalization of the negative Pell's equation $x^2-dy^2 = -1,$ where $d$ is a square-free positive integer. Second, by applying the above characterizations, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the incenter of a given $n$-simplex with $k$-rational vertices to be $k$-rational. On the coordinate plane, we prove that every triangle with $k$-rational vertices and incenter can be obtained by scaling a triangle with $k$-rational side lengths and area, which is a generalization of a Heronian triangle. We also state certain fundamental properties of a few centers of a given triangle with $k$-rational vertices.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 29 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Berry and Tabor conjectured in 1977 that spectra of generic integrable quantum systems have the same local statistics as a Poisson point process. We verify their conjecture in the case of the two-point spectral density for a quantum particle in a three-dimensional box, subject to a Diophantine condition on the domain's proportions. A permissible choice of width, height and depth is for example $1,2^{1/3},2^{-1/3}$. This extends previous work of Eskin, Margulis and Mozes (Annals of Math., 2005) in dimension two, where the problem reduces to the quantitative Oppenheim conjecture for quadratic forms of signature $(2,2)$. The difficulty in three and higher dimensions is that we need to consider the distribution of indefinite forms in shrinking rather than fixed intervals, which we are able to resolve for special diagonal forms of signature $(3,3)$ in various scalings, including a rate of convergence. A key step of our approach is to represent the relevant counting problem as an average of a theta function on $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})^3\backslash\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})^3$ over an expanding family of one-parameter unipotent orbits. The asymptotic behaviour of these unipotent averages follows from Ratner's measure classification theorem and subtle escape of mass estimates.</p></details>

The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $γ+δ/e=\mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $γ^{(n)}+δ^{(n)}/e=η^{(n)}$, $n\ge0$ for sequences of constants $γ^{(n)}$, $δ^{(n)}$, and $η^{(n)}$ (given respectively by raw, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). Investigating the $γ^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations (where $γ^{(0)}=1$ and $γ^{(1)}=γ$), we find that at least one of the pair {$γ,γ^{(2)}$} and -- conditional on a realistic conjecture verified for $2\leq n\leq26$ -- at least two of each set {$γ,γ^{(n)},γ^{(n+1)},\ldots,γ^{(2n)}$} are transcendental, implying that the $γ^{(n)}$ are transcendental infinitely often (with analogous results for the sequence $Γ^{(n)}(1)=\left(-1\right)^{n}γ^{\left(n\right)}$). We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $η^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent, and therefore transcendental, for all $n\ge0$, implying that at least one of each pair, {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e$} and {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e,δ^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n\ge1$. Further analysis of the $γ^{(n)}$ and $η^{(n)}$ reveals that the values $δ^{(n)}/e$ are transcendental infinitely often with positive asymptotic density. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tildeδ^{(n)}$ and $\tildeη^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $γ^{(n)}+\tildeδ^{(n)}/e=\tildeη^{(n)}$.</p></details>
