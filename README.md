After stabilising, we obtain a family triangulated categories which can be regarded as negative Calabi-Yau versions of the Igusa-Todorov discrete cluster categories of type A.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Vivekanand Goswami, Raj Kumar Mistri &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a nonempty finite subset of an additive abelian group $G$. Given a nonnegative integer $h$, the $h$-fold sumset $hA$ is the set of all sums of $h$ elements of $A$, and the restricted $h$-fold sumset $h^\wedge A$ is the set of all sums of $h$ distinct elements of $A$. The union of restricted sumsets $s^\wedge A$, where $s=0, 1, \ldots, h$, is denoted by $[0, h]^\wedge A$. For fixed positive integers $m$ and $h$, the maximum size of the sumset $hA$ of a set $A \subseteq G$ with $m$ elements is denoted by $\nu(G, m, h)$. In other words, $\nu(G, m, h) = \max\{|hA| : A \subseteq G, |A|= m\}$. Analogous quantities can be defined for the sumsets $h^\wedge A$ and $[0, h]^\wedge A$. Optimal upper bounds are known for these quantities. If $G$ is a finite cyclic group of order $n$, then each of these quantities agrees with the optimal upper bound, except in many cases. Bajnok posed the problem of determining all positive integers $n$, $m$, and $h$ for which the value of the function $f(n, m, h)$ is strictly less than the optimal upper bound. He posed similar problems for quantities related to the sumsets $h^\wedge A$ and $[0, h]^\wedge A$. We prove that, for any positive integer $h$, there are infinitely many positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $\nu(\mathbb{Z}_n, m, h)$ is strictly less than the optimal upper bound. We also prove similar results for quantities related to the sumsets $h^\wedge A$ and $[0, h]^\wedge A$ also. These results provide the partial solutions to the problems posed by Bajnok.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13093v1'>2508.13093</a>\]&nbsp; **Counting primitive integral solutions to spherical generalized Fermat equations**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Santiago Arango-Piñeros &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Part of my PhD thesis. Comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A solution $(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{Z}^3-\{(0,0,0)\}$ to a generalized Fermat equation $$ Ax^a + By^b + Cz^c = 0, $$ is called \emph{primitive} if $\gcd(x,y,z) = 1$. By work of Beukers, we know that in the \emph{spherical} regime (that is, when the Euler characteristic $\chi = \tfrac{1}{a} + \tfrac{1}{b} + \tfrac{1}{c} - 1$ is positive), if the equation has one primitive solution, then it has infinitely many. In this work, we use the method of \emph{Fermat descent}, as employed by Poonen--Schaefer--Stoll, to refine Beukers' result to an asymptotic count of the number of primitive integral solutions of bounded height.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Bikram Misra, M. Ram Murty, Biswajyoti Saha &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the triple convolution sum of the divisor function given by $$\sum_{n\leq x} d(n)d(n-h)d(n+h)$$ for $h\neq 0$ and $d(n)$ denotes the number of positive divisors of $n$. Based on algebraic and geometric considerations, Browning conjectured that the above sum is asymptotic to $c_hx(\log x)^3$, for a suitable constant $c_h\neq 0$, as $x\to \infty$. This conjecture is still unproved. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, we show that there are positive constants $A,B$ such that $$Ax(\log x)^3 \leq \sum_{n\leq x} d(n)d(n-h)d(n+h) \leq Bx(\log x)^3,$$ as $x\to \infty$. Second, we provide theoretical basis for Browning's conjectured constant $c_h$ emanating from the theory of Dirichlet series of several complex variables.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13063v1'>2508.13063</a>\]&nbsp; **Generalized Symmetries From Fusion Actions**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Chongying Dong, Siu-Hung Ng, Li Ren, Feng Xu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.QA &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a condensable algebra in a modular tensor category $\EuScript{C}$. We define an action of the fusion category $\EuScript{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\EuScript{C}$ on the morphism space $\mbox{Hom}_{\EuScript{C}}(x,A)$ for any $x$ in $\EuScript{C}$, whose characters are generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\EuScript{B}$ of $\EuScript{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\EuScript{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\EuScript{B}$ to $A^\EuScript{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\EuScript{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOA, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\EuScript{C}_A}$ where $\EuScript{C}=\EuScript{M}_U$ is the $U$-module category. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\EuScript{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Descent theory (a modern formulation of Fermat's classical method of infinite descent) is a powerful tool in arithmetic geometry. In this article, we reinterpret descent theory through the lens of quotient stacks and apply it in the setting where it first arose: the Diophantine study of generalized Fermat equations (1) $$ Ax^a + By^b + Cz^c = 0. $$ We focus on understanding the arithmetic of the stacks that arise from the study of primitive integral solutions to general Fermat equations, rather than on solving any particular instance of the equation.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages. Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate certain generalizations of Camina pairs. Let $H$ be a nontrivial proper subgroup of a finite group $G$. We first show that every nontrivial irreducible complex character of $H$ induces homogeneously to $G$ if and only if for every $x\in G\setminus H$, the element $x$ is conjugate to $xh$ for all $h\in H$. Furthermore we prove that if $xh$ is conjugate to either $x$ or $x^{-1}$ for all $h\in H$ and all $x\in G\setminus H$, then the normal closure $N$ of $H$ in $G$ also satisfies the same condition, and $N$ is nilpotent. Finally, we determine the structure of $H$ under the assumption that for every element $x\in G\setminus H$ of odd order, the coset $xH$ consists entirely of elements of odd order.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 45 pages; comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish the limiting distribution of $\frac{{(\log \log x)}^{1/4}}{\sqrt{x}} \sum_{n\le x}\alpha(n)$ where $\alpha$ is a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, answering a question of Harper. The distributional convergence is proved by applying the martingale central limit theorem to a suitably truncated sum. This truncation is inspired by work of Najnudel, Paquette, Simm and Vu on subcritical holomorphic multiplicative chaos setting, but analysed with a different conditioning argument generalised from Harper's work on fractional moments to circumvent integrability issues at criticality. A significant part of the proof is devoted to the convergence in probability of the associated partial Euler product to a critical multiplicative chaos measure, independent of the mild shift away from the critical line. Our approach to the universality of critical non-Gaussian multiplicative chaos bypasses the barrier analysis with the help of a modified second moment method, and employs a novel argument based on coupling and homogenisation by change of measure, which could be of independent interest.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Francis Brown, Tiago J. Fonseca &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Some references added in v2

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A well-known conjecture of Gross and Zagier states that the values of the higher automorphic Green's function at pairs of points with complex multiplication in the upper half-plane are proportional to the logarithm of an algebraic number. It was recently settled in the case of congruence subgroups of the form $\Gamma_0(N)$ by analytic methods. In this paper we provide a geometric and motivic interpretation of the general conjecture, and show that it is a consequence of a standard conjecture in the theory of motives. In addition, we define a new class of matrix-valued higher Green's functions for both odd and even weight modular forms, and show that they are single-valued periods of a motive constructed from a suitable moduli stack of elliptic curves with marked points. The motive has the structure of a biextension involving symmetric powers of the motives of elliptic curves. This suggests a very general extension of the Gross-Zagier conjecture relating values of matrix-valued higher Green's functions at points which do not necessarily have complex multiplication to special values of $L$-functions. In particular, our motivic interpretation of the Gross-Zagier log-algebraicity conjecture enables us to give a completely geometric proof in level 1 and weight 4 by showing that the motive of the moduli stack $\mathcal{M}_{1,3}$ of elliptic curves with 3 marked points is mixed Tate. In the course of this paper we develop many new foundational results on: the theory of weak harmonic lifts, meromorphic modular forms, biextensions of modular motives, and their corresponding algebraic de Rham cohomology and single-valued periods, which may all be of independent interest.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, using crystal theory we prove the existence of a new family of irreducible components appearing in the tensor product of two irreducible integrable highest weight modules over symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras motivated by the Schur positivity conjecture, Kostant conjecture and Wahl conjecture. We also prove Schur positivity conjecture in full generality when the Lie algebra is a simple Lie algebra under the assumption that $\lambda > > \mu$, i.e. if $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are the two dominant weights appearing in the tensor product then $\lambda+w\mu$ is a dominant weight for all the Weyl group elements $w$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 27 pages, 8 figures. Accepted version. To appear in Documenta Mathematica

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the wrapped Fukaya category $\mathcal{W}(T^*S^1, D)$ of a cylinder relative to a divisor $D= \{p_1,\ldots, p_n\}$ of $n$ points, proving a mirror equivalence with the category of perfect complexes on a crepant resolution (over $k[t_0,\ldots, t_n]$) of the singularity $uv=t_0t_1\ldots t_n$. Upon making the base-change $t_i= f_i(x,y)$, we obtain the derived category of any crepant resolution of the $cA_{n}$ singularity given by the equation $uv= f_0\ldots f_n$. These categories inherit braid group actions via the action on $\mathcal{W}(T^*S^1,D)$ of the mapping class group of $T^*S^1$ fixing $D$. We also give a geometric model of the derived contraction algebra of a $cA_n$ singularity in terms of the relative Fukaya category of the disc.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Henning Haahr Andersen &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 16p

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $U_q$ be the quantum group corresponding to a complex simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ with root system $R$. Assume the quantum parameter $q\in \C$ is a root of unity. In this paper we study the extensions between simple modules in the category consisting of the finite dimensional modules for $U_q$. We first prove that this problem is equivalent to finding the extensions between the finitely many simple modules for the small quantum group $u_q$ in $U_q$. Then we show that the extension groups in question are determined by a finite subset with small highest weights. When the order of $q^2$ is at least the Coxeter number for $R$ we prove that the dimensions of such extension groups equal the top degree coefficients of some associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial for the affine Weyl group for $R$. We relate all this to similar (old) results for almost simple algebraic groups and their Frobenius subgroup schemes over fields of large prime characteristics.</p></details>

### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12836v1'>2508.12836</a>\]&nbsp; **Silting correspondences and Calabi-Yau dg algebras**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Norihiro Hanihara, Osamu Iyama &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 37 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper is devoted to studying two important classes of objects in triangulated categories; silting objects and $d$-cluster tilting objects, and their correspondences. First, we introduce the notion of $d$-silting objects as a generalization tilting objects whose endomorphism algebras have global dimension at most $d$. For a smooth dg algebra $A$ and its $(d+1)$-Calabi-Yau completion $\Pi$, we show that the induction functor gives an embedding from the poset $\mathrm{silt}^dA$ of $d$-silting objects of $A$ to the poset $\mathrm{silt}\Pi$ of silting objects of $\Pi$. Moreover, when $H^0\Pi$ is finite dimensional, this functor identifies the Hasse quiver of $\mathrm{silt}^dA$ as a full subquiver of the Hasse quiver of $\mathrm{silt}\Pi$. In this case, we also prove that each $d$-silting object $P$ of $A$ gives a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of $\mathrm{per} A$ as the $\nu[-d]$-orbit of $P$. Secondly, for a connective Calabi-Yau dg algebra $\Pi$, we study the map from $\mathrm{silt}\Pi$ to the set $d\text{-}\mathrm{ctilt}\mathcal{C}(\Pi)$ of $d$-cluster tilting objects in the cluster category $\mathcal{C}(\Pi)$. We call $\Pi$ $\mathcal{F}$-liftable if the induced map $\mathrm{silt}\Pi\cap\mathcal{F}\to d\text{-}\mathrm{ctilt}\mathcal{C}(\Pi)$ is bijective, where $\mathcal{F}$ is the fundamental domain in $\mathrm{per}\Pi$. We prove that $\mathcal{F}$-liftable Calabi-Yau dg algebras $\Pi$ such that $H^0\Pi$ is hereditary are precisely the Calabi-Yau completions of hereditary algebras. As an application, we obtain counter-examples to an open question posed in [IYa1]. We also study Calabi-Yau dg algebras such that the map $\mathrm{silt}\Pi\to d\text{-}\mathrm{ctilt}\mathcal{C}(\Pi)$ is surjective, which we call liftable. We explain our results by polynomial dg algebras and Calabi-Yau completions of type $A_2$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 50 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is an introduction to cluster algebras and their common triangular bases. These bases are Kazhdan-Lusztig-type and serve as the canonical bases of cluster algebras from the representation-theoretic point of view. We review seeds associated with signed words, cluster operations (freezing and base change), the extension technique from finite to infinite rank, which are convenient tools to study these algebras and their bases. We present recent results on the topic and provide examples. An appendix collects detailed examples of some cluster algebras from Lie theory, including those from Lie groups and representations of quantum affine algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1973, Calder\'{o}n proved that an $m \times 2$ positive semidefinite (psd) biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of ${3m(m+1) \over 2}$ squares of quadratic forms. Very recently, by applying Hilbert's theorem, we proved that a $2 \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of three squares of bilinear forms. This improved Calder\'{o}n's result for $m=2$, and left the sos (sum-of-squares) rank problem of $m \times 2$ biquadratic forms for $m \ge 3$ to further exploration. In this paper, we show that a $3 \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as four squares of bilinear forms. For $m \ge 4$, we make a conjecture that an $m \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as $m+1$ squares of bilinear forms.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-08-18 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Farzin Renan &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** cs.CR &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Digital signatures are fundamental cryptographic tools that provide authentication and integrity in digital communications. However, privacy-sensitive applications, such as e-voting and digital cash, require more restrictive verification models to ensure confidentiality and control. Strong Designated Verifier Signature (SDVS) schemes address this need by enabling the signer to designate a specific verifier, ensuring that only this party can validate the signature. Existing SDVS constructions are primarily based on number-theoretic assumptions and are therefore vulnerable to quantum attacks. Although post-quantum alternatives, particularly those based on lattices, have been proposed, they often entail large key and signature sizes. In this work, we present $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$, a novel isogeny-based SDVS scheme that offers a compact, quantum-resistant alternative to existing SDVS constructions. The scheme leverages the ideal class group action on $\mathbb{F}_p$-isomorphism classes of supersingular elliptic curves and is founded on the hardness of the Multi-Target Group Action Inverse Problem (MT-GAIP). $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$ achieves strong security guarantees, Strong Unforgeability under Chosen-Message Attacks (SUF-CMA), Non-Transferability (NT), and Privacy of Signer's Identity (PSI), in the random oracle model, thereby making it among the most compact PQC-based SDVS schemes and the only post-quantum secure construction based on isogenies.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite set $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$, the $h$-fold sumset is $hA :=\{x_1+\dots+x_h:x_i\in A\}$. We interpret the beginning of the sequence of sumset sizes $(|hA|)_{h=1}^\infty$ in terms of the successive $L^1$-minima of a lattice (specifically, the points in $\mathbb{Z}^{|A|}$ whose coordinates sum to 0 and which are perpendicular to $\langle a_1,\dots,a_{|A|}\rangle$). In particular, if $h_1,h_2$ are the first and second minima, and $1\le h<h_1$, then $|hA|=\binom{h+|A|-1}{|A|-1}$, while if $h_1\le h <h_2$, then $|hA|=\binom{h+|A|-1}{|A|-1}-\binom{h-h_1+|A|-1}{|A|-1}$. This explains the appearance of triangular numbers in the sequence of sumset sizes, an observation related to a recent experiment of Nathanson.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It was shown by Buchweitz, the first author, and Yamaura that any $\mathbb{N}$-graded commutative Gorenstein ring $R$ of Krull dimension one with $R_0$ a field admits a standard silting object $V$ in the stable category $\underline{\mathrm{CM}\, \!}_0^{\mathbb{Z}}R$. Moreover, they proved that the object $V$ is tilting if and only if the $a$-invariant $a$ is non-negative. In this article, under the additional assumption that $R$ is a hypersurface singularity, we give an explicit description of the endomorphism algebra of $V$ and prove that it is Iwanaga-Gorenstein of self-injective dimension at most $2$. In the case of where $a$ is negative, we give an explicit description of the endomorphism dg algebra of $V$ and prove that it is Gorenstein. Moreover, we give a characterization of Gorensteinness of homologically finite dg algebras in terms of Serre functors.</p></details>

It is shown that if $Wg \cong W$ for all $ g \in g $ then the action of the group $G$ by conjugations on $N$ can be extended to an action of the group $G$ on the set $M$. The results allow us to apply methods of commutative algebra to the study of $W$.</p></details>

A similar classification over the complex numbers is also carried out. We follow the general approach by Patera, Winternitz and Zassenhaus but in addition enhance it and rigorously prove its theoretical basis for the required specific cases of classifying subalgebras of real or complex finite-dimensional Lie algebras. As a byproduct, we first construct complete lists of inequivalent subalgebras of the rank-two affine Lie algebra over both the real and complex fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a new family $(\mathcal{T}_n)_{n\geq1}$ of aperiodic sets of Wang tiles and we describe the dynamical properties of the set $\Omega_n$ of valid configurations $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. The tiles can be defined as the different instances of a square-shaped computer chip whose inputs and outputs are 3-dimensional integer vectors. The family include the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles and gathers the hallmarks of other small aperiodic sets of Wang tiles. Notably, the tiles satisfy additive versions of equations verified by the Kari--Culik aperiodic sets of 14 and 13 Wang tiles. Also configurations in $\Omega_n$ are the codings of a $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action on a 2-dimensional torus like the Jeandel--Rao aperiodic set of 11 Wang tiles. The family broadens the relation between quadratic integers and aperiodic tilings beyond the omnipresent golden ratio as the dynamics of $\Omega_n$ involves the positive root $\beta$ of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$, also known as the $n$-th metallic mean. We show the existence of an almost one-to-one factor map $\Omega_n\to\mathbb{T}^2$ which commutes with the shift action on $\Omega_n$ with horizontal and vertical translations by $\beta$ on $\mathbb{T}^2$. The factor map can be explicitly defined by the average of the top labels from the same row of tiles as in Kari and Culik examples. The proofs are based on the minimality of $\Omega_n$ (proved in a previous article) and a polygonal partition of $\mathbb{T}^2$ which we show is a Markov partition for the toral $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action. The partition and the sets of Wang tiles are symmetric which makes them, like Penrose tilings, worthy of investigation.</p></details>

They are discovered by applying the lift-dual operation to some modular rank three Nahm sums in the works of Zagier and the authors. We prove the modularity of four sets of these Nahm sums by establishing Rogers--Ramanujan type identities which express them as modular infinite products. We use various $q$-series techniques including the constant term method and Bailey pairs to prove these identities. Meanwhile, we present some conjectural identities expressing several Nahm sums as modular infinite products.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recurrences of the form \begin{equation*} T(n,k) = (\alpha n+\beta k +\gamma) \ T(n-1,k) + (\alpha'n+\beta'k+\gamma')\ T(n-1,k-1)+\delta_{n,0}\delta_{k,0}. \end{equation*} show up as the recurrence for many well-studied combinatorial sequences such as the Stirling numbers of first and second kind, the Lah numbers, Eulerian numbers etc. Recently, many of these sequences have received generalisations that obey a recurrence of the form \begin{equation*} T(n,k) = (\alpha n+\beta k +\gamma)^l \ T(n-1,k) + (\alpha'n+\beta'k+\gamma')^l\ T(n-1,k-1)+\delta_{n,0}\delta_{k,0}. \end{equation*} where $l$ is a positive integer. Many of these generalised sequences also satisfy properties such as unimodality, log-concavity, gamma-nonnegativity, real-rootedness that the original sequences satisfy. In this article, we give sufficient conditions for rows of triangular arrays, arising from the recurrence stated above, to be log-concave. We show that our sufficient condition is satisfied by many of the classical examples, thereby giving a new unified approach to proving their log-concavity. This sufficient condition also confirms a conjecture of Tankosic about the log-concavity of generalised Lah numbers. Our main technique will be to interpret the triangular array $(T(n,k))$ as weighted lattice paths and produce an injection that is increasing in weight. Finally, we introduce a two-parameter generalisation of the Eulerian numbers analogous to the generalised Stirling and Lah counterparts. We prove that this sequence is palindromic and make some remarks about their gamma-nonnegativity and real-rootedness.</p></details>

We give several examples and prove basic properties of ghosts and pictures for torsion and torsion-free classes. We also introduce a third kind of ghost which we call "extension ghosts". In the next paper we will explain how these new ghosts can be used to visualize the computation of other invariants of $K_3$ of group rings.</p></details>

I show that for $p\equiv 3,5\bmod 8$, the analytic rank of $E_p$ is at least one (Theorem 1.1.2) in line with Beers' predictions. This is done by finding a formula (Theorem 4.1.1) for the global root number of $E_p$ for all twin prime pairs. I also show that Beers' conjecture, that for $p\equiv 1\bmod 8$ the rank of $E_p$ is two, is false as stated because $E_{73}$ has rank zero. In the light of Theorem 4.1.1, Beers' conjecture needs to be modified: if $p\equiv 1\bmod 8$ then the rank of $E_p$ is zero or two (Conjecture 5.3.1).</p></details>

The construction is based on the group algebra of the free group $F_2$, endowed with a filtration relative to a morphism $F_2 \to \mu_N$ (where $\mu_N$ is the group of $N$-th roots of unity). One of the main results therein is the construction of a complete Hopf algebra coproduct $\widehat{\Delta}^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}_N$ on the relative completion of a specific subalgebra $\mathcal{W}^\mathrm{B}$ of the group algebra of $F_2$. However, an explicit formula for this coproduct is missing. In this paper, we show that the discrete Betti harmonic coproduct $\Delta^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}$ defined in \cite{EF1} for the classical case ($N=1$) by the first author and Furusho remains compatible with the filtration structure on $\mathcal{W}^\mathrm{B}$ induced by the relative completion for arbitrary $N$. This compatibility suggests that the completion corresponding to $\Delta^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}$ is a candidate for an explicit realization of $\widehat{\Delta}^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}_N$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1988, Andrews, Dyson, and Hickerson showed that a $q$-series $\sigma$ found in Ramanujan's lost notebook and related to partitions could be interpreted as counting ideals in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})$, and found similar formulas for $\sigma$ in terms of ideals of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$. Cohen followed this by showing more generally that for certain triples of quadratic fields, there is abelian extension and conductor so that the ray class character theta series for all three fields coincide. In the intervening years, several $q$-series counting ideals in quadratic fields have been explored, nearly all relating to the fields explored by Andrews et al. In this paper we give an example of a ray class character theta series which stems from $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-6})$, $\mathbb{Q}(i)$, and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})$. We use recent work of Okano to give explicit formulas via quadratic form theta series with congruence conditions stemming from each field. We isolate an analogue of $\sigma$ for this series and show that it has coefficients also given by a partition generating function.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $p$ be a large prime number. We prove that any integer $\lambda$ modulo $p$ can be represented in the form $$ m!n! +\sum_{i=1}^{47}n_i!\equiv \lambda \pmod p, $$ with $\max\{m,n,n_1,\ldots,n_{47}\}\ll p^{1300/1301}.$ This improves the exponent $1350/1351$ of Garaev, Luca and Shparlinski (2005). Furthermore, we prove that any integer $\lambda$ can be represented in the form $$ m_1!n_1! +m_2!n_2!+m_3!n_3! +m_4!n_4!+m_5!n_5! \equiv \lambda \pmod p $$ with $\max\{m_1,n_1,\ldots,m_5,n_5\}\le p^{97/113 +o(1)}.$ This improves the exponent $27/28$ of Garaev and Garcia (2007). The proofs of these two results are based on the recent work of Grebennikov, Sagdeev, Semchankau and Vasilevskii (2024). We also obtain some lower bound estimates on the cardinality of the product set of two factorials modulo a prime. For instance, we prove that if $0<c<3/20,$ then for $N=[p^{1/2 + c}]$ we have $$ \#\{m!n!\pmod p; \, 1\le m,n\le N\}\gg p^{1/2+2c/3-o(1)}. $$ The proof of this result is based on the work of Banks and Shparlinski (2020) and the work of Katz and Shen (2008) related to the Ruzsa-Pl\"unnecke inequality from additive combinatorics.</p></details>

We analyze three distinct limits of the PT 3-vertex, recovering the unrefined topological vertex, the refined topological vertex, and the Macdonald refined topological vertex. Higher-rank extensions of PT counting and the DT/PT correspondence are also explored. From a quantum algebraic perspective, we construct an operator version of the equivariant PT 3-vertex and term it the Pandharipande--Thomas $qq$-character.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, \gamma=0.577215\ldots , nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, \delta=0.596347\ldots , is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that these two numbers are disjunctively transcendental; that is, at least one of them must be transcendental. The two constants are related through a well-known equation of Hardy, which recently has been generalized to a pair of infinite sequences (\gamma^{\left(n\right)},\delta^{\left(n\right)}) based on moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution. In the present work, we demonstrate the algebraic independence of the set \{\tfrac{\delta^{\left(n\right)}}{e}+\gamma^{\left(n\right)}\}_{n\geq0}, and thus the transcendence of \tfrac{\delta^{\left(n\right)}}{e}+\gamma^{\left(n\right)} for all n\geq0. This further implies the disjunctive-transcendence of each pair (\gamma^{\left(n\right)},\tfrac{\delta^{\left(n\right)}}{e}).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The profinite iterated monodromy group (pfIMG) is a self-similar group associated to dynamical systems. We show that its proper open self-similar subgroups correspond to highly rigid semiconjugacies, which we partly classify in general. For polynomials, we show that only the twisted Chebyshev maps can arise. Next, we define and construct self-similar closures of subgroups of pfIMGs, and show that this preserves many group-theoretic properties of the original subgroup. As a consequence, we conclude that pfIMGs with open subgroups satisfying certain properties (e.g. prosolvable or pronilpotent) either satisfy that property themselves, or arise from one of these exceptional semiconjugacies. This is applied to answer some questions posed in [BGJT25] about open Frattini subgroups of pfIMGs: unicritical polynomials of composite degree do not have an open Frattini subgroup, and a polynomial with an open Frattini subgroup is often pro-\(p\).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a comprehensive generalization of Lusztig's braid group symmetries for quasi-split iquantum groups. Specifically, we give 3 explicit rank one formulas for symmetries acting on integrable modules over a quasi-split iquantum group of arbitrary Kac-Moody type with general parameters. These symmetries are formulated in terms of idivided powers and iweights of the vectors being acted upon. We show that these symmetries are consistent with the relative braid group symmetries on iquantum groups, and they are also related to Lusztig's symmetries via quasi $K$-matrices. Furthermore, through appropriate rescaling, we obtain compatible symmetries for the integral forms of modified iquantum groups and their integrable modules. We verify that these symmetries satisfy the relative braid group relations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study various categories of Whittaker modules over a type I Lie superalgebra realized as cokernel categories that fit into the framework of properly stratified categories. These categories are the target of the Backelin functor $\Gamma_\zeta$. We show that these categories can be described, up to equivalence, as Serre quotients of the BGG category $\mathcal O$ and of certain singular categories of Harish-Chandra $(\mathfrak g,\mathfrak g_{\bar 0})$-bimodules. We also show that $\Gamma_\zeta$ is a realization of the Serre quotient functor. We further investigate a $q$-symmetrized Fock space over a quantum group of type A and prove that, for general linear Lie superalgebras our Whittaker categories, the functor $\Gamma_\zeta$ and various realizations of Serre quotients and Serre quotient functors categorify this $q$-symmetrized Fock space and its $q$-symmetrizer. In this picture, the canonical and dual canonical bases in this $q$-symmetrized Fock space correspond to tilting and simple objects in these Whittaker categories, respectively.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The presence of large partial quotients can invalidate many classical limit theorems in the metric theory of continued fractions. A commonly employed strategy to overcome this problem is to discard the largest partial quotient when formulating variant forms of such theorems. However, this method will fail when dealing with at least two large partial quotients. Motivated by recent work of Tan, Tian, and Wang [Sci. China Math., 2023], we investigate the metric theory of real numbers that contain at least $r$ large partial quotients among the first $n$ terms of their continued fraction expansions. Specifically, let $[a_1(x), a_2(x), \ldots ]$ be the continued fraction expansion of a real number $x \in [0, 1)$. We determine the Lebesgue measure and Hausdorff dimension of the following set: $$ F(r, \psi)=\Big\{ x \in [0,1): \exists 1 \leq k_1< \cdots < k_r \leq n, a_{k_i} (x) \geq \psi(n)~(i=1, \ldots, r)\ \text{for i.m.}~n \in \mathbb{N} \Big\}, $$ where `i.m.' stands for `infinitely many', $r \geq 1$ and $\psi$ is a positive function defined on $\mathbb{N}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Based on comments received, I have added two results to this version. 1) This paper now gives the moduli interpretation of p(n) directly in terms of the location of J in X(1), combined with a CM-isogeny slope. These are the invariants that sum up to p(n). 2) Instead of only proving Ramanujan's congruences mod 5, 7, and 11, the revision proves the congruences mod all powers of 5, 7, and 11

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For each $n\geq 1$, we express the partition function $p(n)$ as a CM trace on $X_0(6)$ of the discriminant $\Delta_n:=1-24n$ invariants of a weight 0 weak Maass function $P$ that records where CM elliptic curves sit on $X(1)$, together with their canonical first-order "CM tangent'', the diagonal local slope of the CM isogeny relation on $X(1)\times X(1)$. In this viewpoint, we obtain a formula for $p(n)\!\!\pmod{\ell},$ when $\ell$ is inert in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta_n}),$ as a Brandt-module pairing $\langle u_{\Delta_n},v_P\rangle$ that is assembled from oriented optimal embeddings of Eichler orders. For $\ell \in \{5, 7, 11\}$ and $j\geq 1$, we obtain a new proof of the Ramanujan congruences $$ p(5^j n +\beta_5(j))\equiv 0\pmod{5^j}, $$ $$ p(7^j n +\beta_7(j))\equiv 0\pmod{7^{ [ j/2]+1}}, $$ $$ p(11^jn+\beta_{11}(j))\equiv 0\pmod{11^j}, $$ where $\beta_m(j)$ is the unique residue $0\le \beta<m^j$ with $24\,\beta_m(j)\equiv 1\pmod{m^j}$. The key point is a "bonus valuation" that stems from the fact that the supersingular locus of $X_0(6)_{\mathbb{F}_{\ell}}$ lies over $\{0, 1728\}$ for $\ell \in \{5, 7, 11\}.$ This special property, combined with the uniform growth of the $\lambda$-adic valuations of the number of oriented optimal embeddings, explains these congruences. More generally, we give a portable genus 0 template showing that the Watson--Atkin $U_\ell$-contraction works uniformly for suitable traces of singular moduli for genus 0 modular curves with $\ell\nmid N.$</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we show that the classical Cassini and Catalan identities for Fibonacci numbers arise naturally from a single quadratic theta-function identity of Ramanujan. Expanding the identity $\psi(q)\psi(q^{3})=\psi(q^{4})\varphi(q^{6})+q\,\varphi(q^{2})\psi(q^{12})$ via the Jacobi triple product and equating coefficients yields the unified $q$-determinant $F_{n+r}(q)F_{n-r}(q)-F_{n}(q)^{2}=(-q)^{\,n-r}F_{r}(q)^{2}$, $n\ge r\ge 1$, where $\psi(q)$ and $\varphi(q)$ are Ramanujan's theta functions with $q$ a complex parameter in the unit disc $(\lvert q \rvert < 1)$ and $F_n(q)$ denotes the Carlitz $q$-Fibonacci polynomials. The radial limit $q\to1^{-}$ recovers Cassini's formula ($r=1$) and Catalan's one-parameter extension, while the same derivation with an auxiliary weight produces new partition-refined versions. The argument uses only standard $q$-series algebra (triple-product expansions, $q$-Pochhammer cancellations, and coefficient extraction), providing a transparent modular explanation of the alternating sign $(-1)^{\,n-r}$ in Catalan's identity through the level-6 provenance of $\varphi$ and $\psi$. Beyond unifying Cassini\textendash Catalan in a single framework, the method lifts seamlessly to higher-order recurrences, giving a template for Tribonacci-type determinants and suggesting congruence phenomena obtained from modular dissections and root-of-unity limits. The results place familiar Fibonacci determinants within Ramanujan's analytic landscape, indicate routes to combinatorial bijections that mirror the analytic cancellations, and connect with themes in modern $q$-series\textemdash ranging from colored partition identities to quantum-modular and exactly solvable models\textemdash thereby highlighting both the explanatory power and the ongoing relevance of Ramanujan's theta identities.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct an fpqc gerbe $\mathcal{E}_{\dot{V}}$ over a global function field $F$ such that for a connected reductive group $G$ over $F$ with finite central subgroup $Z$, the set of $G_{\mathcal{E}_{\dot{V}}}$-torsors contains a subset $H^{1}(\mathcal{E}_{\dot{V}}, Z \to G)$ which allows one to define a global notion of ($Z$-)rigid inner forms. There is a localization map $H^{1}(\mathcal{E}_{\dot{V}}, Z \to G) \to H^{1}(\mathcal{E}_{v}, Z \to G)$, where the latter parametrizes local rigid inner forms (cf. [Kal16, Dil23]) which allows us to organize local rigid inner forms across all places $v$ into coherent families. Doing so enables a construction of (conjectural) global $L$-packets and a conjectural formula for the multiplicity of an automorphic representation $\pi$ in the discrete spectrum of $G$ in terms of these $L$-packets. We also show that, for a connected reductive group $G$ over a global function field $F$, the adelic transfer factor $\Delta_{\mathbb{A}}$ for the ring of adeles $\mathbb{A}$ of $F$ serving an endoscopic datum for $G$ decomposes as the product of the normalized local transfer factors from [Dil20].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This manuscript treats the diverse applications of bricks within modern representation theory and several related domains, and reviews the recent developments and new results on bricks (a.k.a Schur representations). The current survey is an extended version of a mini-course by the second-named author, delivered in the research school on ``New Developments in Representation Theory of Algebras", held in November of 2024, at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST), Japan. The review is mainly oriented towards the direction of research developed by the authors, which has evolved around the algebraic and geometric properties of bricks. More specifically, we discuss the emergence of bricks in $\tau$-tilting theory, torsion theory, geometric representation theory and invariant theory, while providing some links between those. Although we review the applications and properties of bricks from many different areas, the article is not meant to be an exhaustive survey on bricks in representation theory. In the setting of finite dimensional algebras over an algebraically closed field, this manuscript (and many of the recent works of the authors) is strongly motivated by an open conjecture originally posed by the first-named author in 2019, the so-called \emph{second brick Brauer-Thrall conjecture}. In the later sections, where the main focus is on the tame algebras and some other new notions of tameness, we prove some new results on the aforementioned conjecture.</p></details>

> **Comment:** A handful of minor corrections due to helpful readers

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Many problems of arithmetic nature rely on the computation or analysis of values of $L$-functions attached to objects from geometry. Whilst basic analytic properties of the $L$-functions can be difficult to understand, recent research programs have shown that automorphic $L$-values are susceptible to study via algebraic methods linking them to Selmer groups. Iwasawa theory, pioneered first by Iwasawa in the 1960s and later Mazur and Wiles provides an algebraic recipe to obtain a $p$-adic analogue of the $L$-function. In this work we aim to adapt Iwasawa theory to a new context of representations of the unitary group GU(2,1) at primes inert in the respective imaginary quadratic field. This requires a novel approach using the Schneider--Venjakob regulator map, working over locally analytic distribution algebras. Subsequently, we show vanishing of some Bloch--Kato Selmer groups when a certain $p$-adic distribution is non-vanishing. These results verify cases of the Bloch--Kato conjecture for GU(2,1) at inert primes in rank 0.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study line operators and their OPE's in perturbative 3d holomorphic-topological QFT's, including holomorphic-topological twists (quarter-BPS sectors) of 3d $N=2$ theories. In particular, we develop the representation theory of the category $C$ of perturbative line operators and its chiral tensor product, by generalizing techniques introduced by Costello and collaborators. We argue that lines are equivalent to modules for an $A_\infty$ algebra $A^!$ that's Koszul-dual to bulk local operators. We further establish a non-renormalization theorem for the OPE's of lines in a large class of theories (dubbed quasi-linear), allowing an exact resummation of quantum corrections. Based on physics arguments, we propose axioms for the full algebraic structure on $A^!$, calling it a "dg-shifted Yangian," which controls the OPE of lines. A key part of the structure is a Maurer-Cartan element $r(z)\in A^!\otimes A^!(\!(z^{-1})\!)$ that satisfies an $A_\infty$ generalization of the Yang-Baxter equation. As examples, we consider 3d $N=2$ gauge theories with arbitrary Chern-Simons levels, linear matter, and superpotential, and explicitly compute 1) perturbative bulk local operators (as $A_\infty$-chiral algebras); and 2) the Koszul-duals $A^!$ (proving they are dg-shifted Yangians).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>$\widehat{Z}$ invariants, rigorously defined for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds, are expected--on physical grounds--to exist for every closed, oriented 3-manifold. Several prescriptions have been proposed to extend their definition to generic plumbings by reversing the orientation of a negative definite plumbing, thus turning it into a positive definite one. Two existing proposals are relevant for this paper: (i) the regularized $+1/r$-surgery conjecture combined with the false-mock modular conjecture, and (ii) a construction based on resurgence and a false theta function duality. In this note, we compare these proposals on the class of Brieskorn homology spheres $\Sigma\left(s,t,rst\pm1\right)$ and find that they are incompatible in general. Our diagnostic is the effective central charge, $c_{\text{eff}}$, which governs the asymptotic growth of coefficients of $\widehat{Z}$. First, we prove that the upper bound on $c_{\text{eff}}$ from prescription (i) is governed by the Ramanujan theta function, which regularizes the surgery formula. Second, we develop numerical and modular tools that deliver the lower bounds as well as exact values via mixed mock-modular analysis. Complementing this, we also study $c_{\text{eff}}$ for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds which allow for a better comparison of pairs of 3-manifolds related by orientation reversal. As a result, we find that for some Brieskorn spheres the surgery and false-mock prescriptions violate the expected relation between $c_{\text{eff}}$, Chern-Simons invariants and non-abelian flat connections. These findings underscore $\widehat{Z}$ as a sensitive probe of the "positive side" of $\widehat{Z}$-theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We revisit the classical constructions of tensor-triangular geometry in the setting of stably symmetric monoidal idempotent-complete $\infty$-categories, henceforth referred to as 2-rings. In this setting, we produce a Zariski topology, a Zariski spectrum, a category of locally 2-ringed spaces (more generally $\infty$-topoi), and an affine spectrum-global sections adjunction, based on the framework of ``$\infty$-topoi with geometric structure'' as developed by Lurie in \cite{LurieDAG5}. Using work of Kock and Pitsch, we compute that the underlying space of the Zariski spectrum of a 2-ring recovers the Balmer spectrum of its homotopy category. These constructions mirror the analogous structures in the classical Zariski geometry of commutative rings (and commutative ring spectra), and we also demonstrate additional compatibility between classical Zariski and higher Zariski geometry. For rigid 2-rings, we show that the descent results of Balmer and Favi admit coherent enhancements. As a corollary, we obtain that the Zariski spectrum fully faithfully embeds rigid 2-rings into locally 2-ringed $\infty$-topoi. In an appendix, we prove a ``stalk-locality principle'' for the telescope conjecture in the rigid setting, extending earlier work of Hrbek.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the theory of inscribed $v$-sheaves, a differentiable extension of the theory of diamonds and $v$-sheaves with internal tangent bundles that are often relative inscribed Banach-Colmez spaces, then apply this theory to the study of $p$-adic periods. In particular, we construct natural inscribed versions of the Hodge and Hodge-Tate period maps and their lattice refinements for de Rham torsors, then compute the derivatives of these period maps in terms of classical structures in $p$-adic Hodge theory. These torsors include infinite level global Shimura varieties and infinite level local Shimura varieties, and for these spaces we also give another moduli-theoretic construction of the inscribed structure; the construction in the local Shimura case applies more generally to the non-minuscule moduli of mixed characterisic local shtukas with one leg. The key new ingredients in our study of inscribed structures on $p$-adic Lie group torsors over smooth rigid varieties over a $p$-adic field are the Liu-Zhu period map, a refinement of the Hodge period map whose derivative is the geometric Sen morphism/canonical Higgs field, and a closely related exact tensor functor from $\mathbb{Q}_p$-local systems to a category of twistor bundles on the relative thickened Fargues-Fontaine curve. These new structures are only visible after passing to the inscribed setting. We also discuss some possible implications of our computations in the vein of ``differential topology for diamonds."</p></details>

> **Comment:** 14 pages Some minor changes. The statement and proof of Proposition 3.8 have been adjusted

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we introduce, according to one of the main ideas of $\tau$-tilting theory, the $\tau$-Hochschild cohomology in degree one of a finite dimensional $k$-algebra $\Lambda$, where $k$ is a field. We define the excess of $\Lambda$ as the difference between the dimensions of the $\tau$-Hochschild cohomology in degree one and the dimension of the usual Hochschild cohomology in degree one. One of the main results is that for a zero excess bound quiver algebra $\Lambda=kQ/I$, the Hochschild cohomology in degree two $\mathsf{HH}^2(\Lambda) $ is isomorphic to the space of morphisms $\mathsf{Hom}_{kQ-kQ}(I/I^2, \Lambda).$ This is useful to determine when $\mathsf{HH}^2(\Lambda)=0$ for these algebras. We compute the excess for hereditary, radical square zero and monomial triangular algebras. For a bound quiver algebra $\Lambda$, a formula for the excess of $\Lambda$ is obtained. We also give a criterion for $\Lambda$ to be $\tau$-rigid.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Chabauty--Coleman--Kim method in depth two describes the rational points on a curve in terms of a generalisation of Nekov\'a\v{r}'s $p$-adic height pairing which replaces $\mathbb{G}_m$ with a higher Chow group. It is unclear both what the domain of definition of this pairing is, and how to compute it. This paper explores the relevance of the Beilinson--Bloch conjectures to this problem. In particular, it is shown that if $X$ is a smooth projective curve and the Albanese kernel of $X\times X$ is torsion, then there is an algorithm to compute the generalised height pairing on a pair of rational points on the Jacobian. This leads to the consideration of certain `motivic refinements' of the nonabelian cohomology varieties which arise in nonabelian Chabauty.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $q$ be an odd power of a prime $p$, and $S \subset \mathbb{F}_q^*$ such that $S=-S$ and $S/S \neq \mathbb{F}_q^*$. We show that the clique number of the Cayley graph $\mathrm{Cay}(\mathbb{F}_q^+,S)$ is at most $\sqrt{|S/S|}+\sqrt{q/p}$, improving the best-known $\sqrt{q}$ upper bound for many families of such graphs substantially. Such a new bound is strongest for cyclotomic graphs and in particular, it implies the first nontrivial upper bound on the clique number of all generalized Paley graphs of non-square order, extending the work of Hanson and Pertidis. Moreover, our new bound is asymptotically sharp for an infinite family of generalized Paley graphs, and we further discover the first nontrivial family among them for which the clique number can be exactly determined. We also obtain a new lower bound on the number of directions determined by a large Cartesian product in the affine Galois plane $AG(2,q)$, which is sharp for infinite families.</p></details>

We introduce the concept of intersection indicium as a generalization of the concept of ascending index introduced in [2] and prove some of its properties. We then establish the Inverse intersection indicium problem for number fields (excluding certain cases) which is a generalization of Inverse ascending index problem for number fields proved in [2]. We give a field theoretic formulation for the concept of minimal generating sets of splitting fields which was introduced by the author and Vanchinathan in [10] and generalize a result in [10] for number fields and also establish the existence of field extensions over number fields for given degree and given cardinality of minimal generating set of Galois closure dividing the degree. We generalize a result in [6] by establishing that a certain family of triplets is compositum feasible over any number field and we also list all the irreducible triplets in this family. We also prove a partial case of a conjecture in [6]. In the concluding section of this article, we improve on the inverse problems proved in [2] and this article by proving that there exist arbitrarily large finite families of pairwise non-isomorphic extensions having additional properties that satisfy the given conditions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A single closed expression $f_{\text{Alpay},U}(x)$ is presented which, for every integer $x\ge 0$, returns the $(x+1)$-th prime $p_{x+1}$. The construction uses only integer arithmetic, greatest common divisors, and floor functions. A prime indicator $I(j)$ is encoded through a short $\gcd$-sum; a cumulative counter $S(i)=\sum_{j\le i}I(j)$ equals $\pi(i)$; and a folded step $A(i,x)$ counts precisely up to the next prime index without piecewise branching. A corollary shows that for any fixed integer $L\ge 2$, the integer $P^\star=f_{\text{Alpay},U}(L)$ is prime and $P^\star>L$. Two explicit schedules $U(x)$ are given: a square schedule $U_{\text{sq}}(x)=(x+1)^2$ and a near-linear schedule $U_{\text{Alpay-lin}}(x)=\Theta(x\log x)$ justified by explicit bounds on $p_n$. We include non-synonymy certificates relative to Willans-type enumerators (schedule and operator-signature separation) and prove an asymptotic minimality bound: any forward-count enumerator requires $U(x)=\Omega(x\log x)$ while $U_{\text{Alpay-lin}}$ achieves $O(x\log x)$. We also provide explicit operation counts (''form complexity'') of the folded expression.</p></details>

Fixing a non-empty finite set $\mathcal{S}$ of primes, we consider the simultaneous supersingular reduction modulo $\ell\in\mathcal{S}$ of (several copies of) $p$-adic Hecke orbits of $A_0$. We give a precise description of the image of this map. As an application, we give a more conceptual proof of Mazur's conjecture on non-torsionness of higher Heegner points on an abelian variety which is a quotient of the Jacobian of a Shimura curve. Our arguments simplify those of C.Cornut and V.Vatsal in two important aspects: (1) we do not need to assume the $p$-adic group $G^1(\mathbb{Q}_p)/Z_{G^1(\mathbb{Q}_p)}$ to be simple; (2) we do not need to consider separately the ``geometric" part and ``chaotic" part in the Hecke orbits.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using a geometric argument building on our new theory of graded sheaves, we compute the categorical trace and Drinfel'd center of the (graded) finite Hecke category $\mathsf{H}_W^\mathsf{gr} = \mathsf{Ch}^b(\mathsf{SBim}_W)$ in terms of the category of (graded) unipotent character sheaves, upgrading results of Ben-Zvi-Nadler and Bezrukavninov-Finkelberg-Ostrik. In type $A$, we relate the categorical trace to the category of $2$-periodic coherent sheaves on the Hilbert schemes $\mathsf{Hilb}_n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$ (equivariant with respect to the natural $\mathbb{C}^* \times \mathbb{C}^*$ action), yielding a proof of (a $2$-periodized version of) a conjecture of Gorsky-Negut-Rasmussen which relates HOMFLY-PT link homology and the spaces of global sections of certain coherent sheaves on $\mathsf{Hilb}_n(\mathbb{C}^2)$. As an important computational input, we also establish a conjecture of Gorsky-Hogancamp-Wedrich on the formality of the Hochschild homology of $\mathsf{H}_W^\mathsf{gr}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the relationship between almost mathematics, condensed mathematics and the categories of seminormed and Banach modules over a Banach ring $A$, with submetric (norm-decreasing) $A$-module homomorphisms for morphisms. If $A$ is a Banach ring with a norm-multiplicative topologically nilpotent unit $\varpi$ contained in the closed unit ball $A_{\leq1}$ such that $\varpi$ admits a compatible system of $p$-power roots $\varpi^{1/p^{n}}$ with \begin{equation*}\lVert\varpi^{1/p^{n}}\rVert=\lVert\varpi\rVert^{1/p^{n}}\end{equation*}for all $n$, we prove that the "almost closed unit ball" functor \begin{equation*}M\mapsto M_{\leq1}^{a}\end{equation*}is an equivalence between the category of Banach $A$-modules and submetric $A$-module maps and the category of $\varpi$-adically complete, $\varpi$-torsion-free almost $(A_{\leq1}, (\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-modules. We also obtain an analogous result for Banach algebras and almost algebras. The main novelty in our approach is that we show that the norm on the Banach module $M$ is completely determined by the corresponding almost $A_{\leq1}$-module $M_{\leq1}^{a}$, rather than being determined only up to equivalence. We deduce from our results the existence of a natural fully faithful embedding of the category of Banach $A$-modules and submetric $A$-module maps into the category of (static) condensed almost $(A_{\leq1}, (\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-modules in the sense of Mann, which factors through the full subcategory of solid condensed $(A_{\leq1}, (\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-almost modules. If $A$ is perfectoid and the adic spectrum of $(A, A^{\circ})$ is totally disconnected, we show that this embedding transforms the complete tensor product of Banach $A$-modules into (an almost analog of) the solid tensor product of solid condensed almost modules.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The u-invariant of a field is the largest dimension of an anisotropic quadratic torsion form over the field. In this article we obtain a bound on the u-invariant of function fields in one variable over a henselian valued field with arbitrary value group and with residue field of characteristic different from 2. This generalises a theorem due to Harbater, Hartmann and Krashen and its extension due to Scheiderer. Their result covers the special case where the valuation is discrete. We further give a new proof of a theorem due to Parimala and Suresh bounding by 8 the u-invariant of a function field in one variable over any henselian discretely valued field of characteristic 0 with perfect residue field of characteristic 2.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The local converse theorem for Rankin-Selberg gamma factors of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ proved by Piatetski-Shapiro over $\mathbb{C}$ no longer holds after reduction modulo $\ell \neq p$. To remedy this, we construct new $\mathrm{GL}_n \times \mathrm{GL}_m$ gamma factors valued in arbitrary $\mathbb{Z}[1/p, \zeta_p]$-algebras for Whittaker-type representations, show that they satisfy a functional equation, and then prove a $\mathrm{GL}_n \times \mathrm{GL}_{n-1}$ converse theorem for irreducible cuspidal representations. In the $\mathrm{GL}_2 \times \mathrm{GL}_1$ case, we define an alternative "new" gamma factor, which takes values in $k$ and satisfies a converse theorem that matches the converse theorem in characteristic $0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By a result of Serre, if $A$ is an elliptic curve without CM defined over a number field $L$, then the set of primes of $L$ for which $A$ has ordinary reduction has density $1$. Katz and Ogus proved the same is true when $A$ is an abelian surface, after possibly passing to a finite extension of $L$. More recently, Sawin computed the density of the set of primes of $L$ for which an abelian surface $A$ has ordinary reduction, depending on the endomorphism algebra of $A$. In this paper, we prove some generalizations of these results when $A$ is an absolutely simple abelian variety of arbitrary dimension whose endomorphism algebra is a CM field $F$, under specific conditions on the signature of the multiplication action of $F$ on $A$. We include explicit examples from Jacobians of curves of genus three through seven admitting cyclic covers to the projective line.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The P\'olya group ${\rm Po}(K)$ of a number field $K$ is the subgroup of the ideal class group ${\rm Cl}(K)$ of $K$ generated by the classes of all the products of the prime ideals of $K$ with the same norm. Motivated by the classical "one class in each genus problem", we prove general finiteness theorems for the number fields $K$ with a fixed P\'olya index $\left[{\rm Cl}(K):{\rm Po}(K)\right]$ in the families of Galois number fields, solvable CM-fields, and real quadratic fields of extended R-D type. We also give classification results for specific families. Most notably, we classify, unconditionally, all imaginary bi-quadratic and imaginary tri-quadratic fields with the P\'olya index one. Furthermore, we classify all real quadratic fields of extended R-D type (with possibly only one more field) with the P\'olya index one. Also, under GRH, we give the complete list of 161 imaginary quadratic fields with the P\'olya index two. Finally, as a byproduct of our results, we extend, from narrow R-D types to the extended R-D types, Dohmae's classification of real quadratic fields of narrow R-D type whose narrow genus numbers equal their narrow class numbers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 19 pages, plus 12 pages appendix

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We apply the calculus of variations to construct a new sequence of linear combinations of derivatives of the Riemann $\zeta$-function adapted to Levinson's method, which yield a positive proportion of zeros of the $\zeta$-function on the critical line, regardless of how short the mollifier is. Our construction extends readily to modular $L$-functions. Even with Levinson's original choice of mollifier, our method more than doubles the proportions of zeros on the critical line for modular $L$-functions previously obtained by Bernard and K\"uhn--Robles--Zeindler, while relying on the same arithmetic inputs. This indicates that optimizing the linear combinations, an approach that has received relatively little attention, has a more pronounced effect than refining the mollifier when it is short. Curiously, our linear combinations provide non-trivial smooth approximations of Siegel's $\mathfrak{f}$-function in the celebrated Riemann--Siegel formula.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notions of local realizability at a prime and algebraic realizability of an integer sequence. After discussing this notion in general we consider it for the Euler numbers, the Bernoulli denominators, and the Bernoulli numerators. This gives, for example, a dynamical characterization of the Bernoulli regular primes. Algebraic realizability of the Bernoulli denominators is shown at every prime, giving a different perspective on the great diversity of congruences satisfied by this sequence. We show that the sequence of Euler numbers cannot be realized on a nilpotent group, which may explain why it is less hospitable to congruence hunting.</p></details>
