<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this short note, we prove the equivalence of Grothendieck-Katz $p$-curvature Conjecture with Conjecture F in Ekedahl-Shepherd-Barron-Taylor. More precisely, we show that Conjecture F implies the $p$-curvature conjecture, and that the $p$-curvature Conjecture implies Conjecture F for the foliation attached to a vector bundle with integrable connection.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The aim of the paper is to define noncommutative cluster structure on several algebras ${\mathcal A}$ related to marked surfaces possibly with orbifold points of various orders, which includes noncommutative clusters, i.e., embeddings of a given group $G$ into the multiplicative monoid ${\mathcal A}^\times$ and an action of a certain braid-like group $Br_{\mathcal A}$ by automorphisms of each cluster group in a compatible way. For punctured surfaces we construct new symmetries, noncommutative tagged clusters and establish a noncommutative Laurent Phenomenon.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We classify the irreducible representations of a family of finite-dimensional pointed liftings $H_\lambda$ of the Nichols algebra associated with the diagram $A_2$ with parameter $q=-1$. We show that these algebras have infinite representation type and construct an indecomposable $H_\lambda$-module of dimension $n$ for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Finally, we study a semisimple category $\underline{\mathrm{Rep}} H_\lambda$ arising as a quotient of $\mathrm{Rep} H_\lambda$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Coh zeta function for a family of inert quadratic orders, which we conjecture to be given by $t$-deformed Bressoud $q$-series. This completes a trilogy connecting the zeta functions of ramified and split quadratic orders to the classical Andrews--Gordon and Bressoud identities, respectively. We provide strong evidence for this conjecture by deriving the first explicit formulas for the finitized Coh zeta function of the simplest order in the family, and for the $t=1$ specialization of the finitized Coh zeta functions for all orders in the family. Our primary tool is a new method based on M\"obius inversion on posets.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Shenghao Hua &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 13 pages. Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we demonstrate that, given an orthonormal basis of holomorphic Hecke cusp forms, conditionally, quadratic forms composed of cusp forms -- each expressed as a bounded linear combination of holomorphic Hecke cusp forms -- are generally not themselves expressible as bounded linear combinations of holomorphic Hecke cusp forms when the sum of the weights exceeds some absolute constant, provided that the coefficients of the quadratic form satisfy appropriate nonvanishing and boundedness conditions. This illustrates the finiteness of the number of solutions to the linear equation of modular forms equated to a quadratic form of large weight. We also show that, conditionally, for $0 < p < 2$, the $\ell^p$-norm of such quadratic forms in holomorphic Hecke cusp forms tends to zero asymptotically with respect to expansion in this orthonormal basis of Hecke eigenforms.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 38 pages. Various changes to the structure and contents following referees suggestions. Accepted for publication in GAFA

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that one hundred percent of the closed geodesic periods of a Hecke--Maa{\ss} cusp form for the modular group are non-vanishing when ordered by length. We present applications to the non-vanishing of central values of Rankin--Selberg $L$-functions. Similar results for holomorphic forms for general Fuchsian groups of finite covolume with a cusp are also obtained, as well as results towards normal distribution. Our new key ingredient is to relate the distributions of closed geodesic periods and vertical line integrals via graph theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates simple modules of the semi-direct product algebra $\mathcal{W}\ltimes\widehat{H_4}$, where $\mathcal{W}$ is the Witt algebra and $\widehat{H_4}$ is the loop Diamond algebra. We first use simple modules over the Weyl algebra to construct a family of simple $\mathcal{W}\ltimes\widehat{H_4}$-modules. Then, we classify simple $\mathcal{W}\ltimes\widehat{H_4}$-modules that are free $U(\mathbb{C}L_0\oplus\mathbb{C} a_0)$-modules of rank 1. Finally, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for finitely many simple $U(\mathbb{C}L_0\oplus\mathbb{C}a_0)$-free modules to be simple, and then determine their isomorphism classes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G=\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F})$, $\mathrm{O}_n(\mathbb{F})$, or $\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{F})$ be one of the classical groups over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $0$, let $\breve{G}$ be the MVW-extension of $G$, and let $\mathfrak{g}$ be the Lie algebra of $G$. In this paper, we classify the closed orbits in the enhanced standard representation $\mathfrak{g}\times E$ of $G$, where $E$ is the natural representation if $G=\mathrm{O}_n(\mathbb{F})$ or $\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{F})$, and is the direct sum of the natural representation and its dual if $G=\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F})$. Additionally, for every closed $G$-orbit in $\mathfrak{g}\times E$, we prove that it is $\breve{G}$-stable, and determine explicitly the corresponding stabilizer group as well as the action on the normal space.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages; minor typos are fixed and important references added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Previously introduced the $GL_{\ell+1}(\mathbb{R})$ Hecke-Baxter operator is a one-parameter family of elements in the commutative spherical Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(GL_{\ell+1}(\mathbb{R}),O_{\ell+1})$. Its action on spherical vectors in spherical principle series representations of $GL_{\ell+1}(\mathbb{R})$ is given by multiplication by the Archimedean $L$-factors associated to these representations. In this note we propose an extension of the construction to other (non-spherical) $GL_{\ell+1}(\mathbb{R})$ principle series representations providing a relevant generalization of the notions of spherical vector, commutative spherical Hecke algebra and the Hecke-Baxter operator to the general case. Action of the introduced Hecke-Baxter operator on the generalized spherical vectors is given by multiplication by the Archiemdean $L$-factor associated to the corresponding principle series representation of $GL_{\ell+1}(\mathbb{R})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish character rigidity for all non-uniform higher-rank irreducible lattices in semisimple groups of characteristic other than 2. This implies stabilizer rigidity for probability measure preserving actions and rigidity of invariant random subgroups, confirming a conjecture of Stuck and Zimmer for non-uniform lattices in full generality.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-29 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zhenxing Di, Liping Li, Li Liang &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** A small technical issue in Theorem 1.4 fixed; new results on infinite subcategories of FI/VI added into Theorem 1.8

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that every Grothendieck topology induces a hereditary torsion pair in the category of presheaves of modules on a ringed site, and obtain a homological characterization of sheaves of modules: a presheaf of modules is a sheaf of modules if and only if it is saturated with respect to torsion presheaves, or equivalently, it is right perpendicular to torsion presheaves in the sense of Geigle and Lenzing. We also study Grothendieck topologies on directed categories $\mathscr{C}$ satisfying certain finiteness condition, and show that every Grothendieck topology on $\mathscr{C}$ is a subcategory topology if and only if $\mathscr{C}$ is an artinian EI category. Consequently, in this case every sheaf category is equivalent to the presheaf category over a full subcategory of $\mathscr{C}$. Finally, we classify all Grothendieck topologies on a special type of noetherian EI categories, and extend the locally self-injective property of representations of $\mathrm{F}$ and $\mathrm{VI}$ to representations of their infinite full subcategories. Some potential applications in group representation theory are given at the end of this paper.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 52 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that the vanishing of the module of universal norms associated with certain de Rham Galois representations characterises the algebraic extensions of the field of $p$-adic numbers whose completion is a perfectoid field. We thereby generalise results by Coates and Greenberg for abelian varieties, and by Bondarko for $p$-divisible groups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 54 pages, 6 figures, several appendices

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Multiple zeta values arise as special values of polylogarithms defined on Riemann surfaces of various genera. Building on the vast knowledge for classical and elliptic multiple zeta values, we explore a canonical extension of the formalism to Riemann surfaces of higher genera, which yields higher-genus multiple zeta values. We provide a regularization prescription for higher-genus polylogarithms, which we extend to higher-genus multiple zeta values. Our regularization uses the Schottky uniformization to trace back higher-genus endpoint regularization to known regularization at genus one. Additionally, we are commenting on relations among higher-genus multiple zeta values implied by degeneration of the underlying geometry, where we distinguish between the two types of separating and non-separating degeneration. Finally, employing functional relations for higher-genus polylogarithms in the Schottky uniformization, we explore relations among higher-genus multiple zeta values and check them against our numerical testing setup. We identify relations for higher-genus multiple zeta values beyond those implied by polylogarithm identities, thereby matching the situation for genus zero and genus one. While we find several known structures for elliptic multiple zeta values to generalize to relations for higher-genus multiple zeta values, there are further classes of relations arising from the interplay and combinatorics of different cycles.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$, and let $f_1(z),\ldots, f_m(z) \in K[[z]]$ such that, for every $1 \leq i \leq m$, $f_i(z)$ is a solution of a differential operator $\mathcal{L}_i \in E_p[d/dz]$, where $E_p$ is the field of analytic elements. Suppose that $K$ is totally ramified over $\mathbb{Q}_p$, and that for every $1 \leq i \leq m$, the operator $\mathcal{L}_i$ has a strong Frobenius structure and satisfies the maximal order multiplicity (MOM) condition at zero. Then, we show that $f_1(z),\ldots, f_m(z)$ are algebraically dependent over $E_p$ if and only if there exist integers $a_1,\ldots, a_m$, not all zero, such that $f_1(z)^{a_1} \cdots f_m(z)^{a_m}\in E_p$. The main consequence of this result is that it provides a tool to study the algebraic independence of a broad class of $G$-functions and certain $E$-functions over the field of analytic elements.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 33 pages. See 2507.04572, as well

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There is a homomorphism of associative superalgebras from the enveloping algebra of the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ to the Weyl-Clifford superalgebra $W(2n|n)$ with $2n$ even Weyl algebra generators and $n$ odd Clifford algebra generators. Under this homomorphism, the positive odd root vector $x\in\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ is sent to the Dirac operator $\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\in W(2n|n)$ and generates a left ideal $I$. The corresponding reduction (super)algebra, denoted $Z_n$, is the normalizer of $I$ in $W(2n|n)$ modulo $I$. By construction, $Z_n$ acts on the space of all Clifford algebra-valued polynomial solutions to the (massless) Dirac equation. In this paper, we find a complete presentation of (a localization of) this so-termed Dirac reduction algebra. Furthermore, we use the Dirac reduction algebra to generate all polynomial solutions to the Dirac equation in $n$-dimensional flat spacetime.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a compatibility between parabolic restriction of Whittaker sheaves and restriction of representations under the geometric Casselman-Shalika equivalence. To do this, we establish various Hecke structures on geometric Eisenstein series functors, generalizing results of Braverman-Gaitsgory in the case of a principal parabolic. Moreover, we relate compactified and non-compactified geometric Eisenstein series functors via Koszul duality. We sketch a proof that the spectral-to-automorphic geometric Langlands functor commutes with constant term functors.</p></details>

Further, a stronger bound of $N=O(((n-k)!)^{1/2})$, where $k\gg\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}$ is shown for colourings avoiding solutions to the equation $x_1+x_2+...+x_{12}=y_1+y_2+...+y_9$.

> **Comment:** 19 pages. Comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide an algorithmic framework for the computation of explicit representing matrices for all irreducible representations of a generalized symmetric group $\Grin_n$, i.e., a wreath product of cyclic group of order $r$ with the symmetric group $\Symm_n$. The basic building block for this framework is the Specht matrix, a matrix with entries $0$ and $\pm1$, defined in terms of pairs of certain words. Combinatorial objects like Young diagrams and Young tableaus arise naturally from this setup. In the case $r = 1$, we recover Young's natural representations of the symmetric group. For general $r$, a suitable notion of pairs of $r$-words is used to extend the construction to generalized symmetric groups. Separately, for $r = 2$, where $\Grin_n$ is the Weyl group of type $B_n$, a different construction is based on a notion of pairs of biwords.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The diagonal reduction algebra of a reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is a localization of the Mickelsson algebra associated to the symmetric pair $(\mathfrak{g}\times\mathfrak{g},\, \mathfrak{g})$. In 2010, Khoroshkin and Ogievetsky introduced the methods of stabilization and cutting, which relate the commutation relations in the diagonal reduction algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_m\oplus\mathfrak{gl}_n$ with those in the diagonal reduction algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_{m+n}$. We extend this method to a wide range of reduction algebras, including all diagonal and differential reduction algebras for basic classical Lie superalgebras. We show how the method can be used for computing relations in the diagonal reduction algebra of $\mathfrak{so}_8$ and differential reduction algebra of $\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite group $\Gamma$, we study the distribution of the Galois group $G_{\emptyset}^{\#}(K)$ of the maximal unramified extension of $K$ that is split completely at $\infty$ and has degree prime to $|\Gamma|$ and $\textit{Char}(K)$, as $K$ varies over imaginary $\Gamma$-extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$. In the function field case, we compute the moments of the distribution of $G_{\emptyset}^{\#}(K)$ by counting points on Hurwitz stacks. In order to understand the probability of the distribution, we prove that $G_{\emptyset}^{\#}(K)$ admits presentations of a specific form, then use this presentation to build random groups to simulate the behavior of $G_{\emptyset}^{\#}(K)$, and make the conjecture to predict the distribution using the probability measures of these random groups. Our results provide the imaginary analog of the work of Wood, Zureick-Brown, and the first author on the nonabelian Cohen--Lenstra heuristics.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent paper, Aistleitner, Gantert, Kabluchko, Prochno and Ramanan studied large deviation principles (LDPs) for lacunary trigonometric sums $\sum_{n=1}^N \cos(2 \pi n_k x)$, where the sequence $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ satisfies the Hadamard gap condition $n_{k+1} / n_k \geq q > 1$ for $k \geq 1$. A crucial ingredient in their work were asymptotic estimates for the moment generating function (MGF) of such sums, which turned out to depend on the fine arithmetic structure of the sequence $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ in an intricate way. In the present paper we carry out a detailed study of the MGF for lacunary trigonometric sums (without any structural assumptions on the underlying sequence, other than lacunarity), and we determine the sharp threshold where arithmetic effects start to play a role. As an application, we prove moderate deviation principles for lacunary trigonometric sums, and show that the tail probabilities are in accordance with Gaussian behavior throughout the whole range between the central limit theorem and the LDP regime.</p></details>

Consider the problem of showing existence of primitive elements in a subset $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^r}$. We prove a sieve criterion for existence of such elements, dependent only on an estimate for the character sum $\sum_{\gamma \in \mathcal{A}}\chi(\gamma)$. The flexibility and direct applicability of our criterion should be of considerable interest for problems in this field. We demonstrate the utility of our result by tackling a problem of Fernandes and Reis (2021) with $\mathcal{A}$ avoiding affine hyperplanes, obtaining significant improvements over previous knowledge.</p></details>

This article presents an algorithm to determine the image of the mod-$3$ Galois representation associated to a principally polarized abelian surface over $\mathbb{Q}$. Conjugacy class distribution of subgroups of $\mathrm{GSp}(4,\mathbb{F}_3)$ is a key ingredient. While this ingredient is feasible to compute for $\mathrm{GSp}(4,\mathbb{F}_{\ell})$ for any small prime $\ell$, distinguishing Gassmann-equivalent subgroups is a delicate problem.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb{R}^m$ be endowed with the Euclidean metric. The covering radius of a lattice $\Lambda \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ is the least distance $r$ such that, given any point of $\mathbb{R}^m$, the distance from that point to $\Lambda$ is not more than $r$. Lattices can occur via the unit group of the ring of integers in an algebraic number field $\mathbb{K}$, by applying a logarithmic embedding $\mathbb{K}^*\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$. In this paper, we examine those lattices which arise from the cyclotomic number field $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)$, for a given positive integer $n\geq5$ such that $n\not \equiv 2\pmod{4}$. We then provide improvements to an upper bound in (de Araujo, 2024), and conclude with an upper bound on the covering radius for this lattice in terms of $n$ and the number of its distinct prime factors. In particular, we improve Lemma 2 of (de Araujo, 2024) and show that, asymptotically, it can be improved no further.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider certain Lambert series as generating functions of divisor sums twisted by Dirichlet characters and compute their exact resurgent transseries expansion near $q=1^-$. For special values of the parameters, these Lambert series are expressible in terms of iterated integrals of holomorphic Eisenstein series twisted by the same characters and the transseries representation is a direct consequence of the action of Fricke involution on such twisted Eisenstein series. When the parameters of the Lambert series are generic the transseries representation provides for a quantum-modular version of Fricke involution which for a particular example we show being equivalent to modular resurgent structures found in topological strings observables.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Adds picture

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>"Murmurations" are a recently-discovered type of fine structure in sums of Dirichlet coefficients averaged over families of $L$-functions. The root cause of this phenomenon remains mysterious. In the present paper, we demonstrate how murmurations arise from the averaging of approximate functional equations. This approach to the study of murmurations explains their empirically observed ubiquity, as well as their characteristic scale invariance and the peculiar normalization they demand. We implement our new approach to the study of murmurations in the case of quadratic twist families of $\mathrm{GL}_1$ automorphic representations, where we exhibit murmurations unconditionally. Our proof centres around estimating mean values of the $L$-functions in our quadratic twist families. In particular, we require estimates valid significantly higher in the critical strip than what existing results provide. To produce these estimates, we construct a variation of the approximate functional equation which is imbued with a mechanism for dynamically rebalancing error terms while preserving holomorphicity. We also generalize and sharpen results of Jutila and Stankus on sums of quadratic characters and fundamental discriminants. Mean value estimates are given for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ quadratic twist families as well.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a large number of analytic evaluations of Euler sums, namely sums such as \begin{align} M(m,n_0,n_1,n_2, \ldots, n_t) &= \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{H(k)^m}{k^{n_0} (k+1)^{n_1} (k+2)^{n_2} \cdots (k+t)^{n_t}}, \nonumber \end{align} for nonnegative integers $m$ and $(n_i)$, with $m \geq 1$ and $n_0 + n_1 + \cdots + n_t \geq 2$, where $H(k) = \sum_{j=1}^k 1/j$ is the harmonic function. These results were obtained either by algebraic derivations, or else by very high-precision numerical evaluations combined with an integer relation algorithm to obtain the analytic formulas. We show how many of these results can be derived from a few basic facts, and that these techniques are applicable to Euler sums of even more general forms than the above cases. We then show that these results permit the calculation of constants for Euler sums resembling the Stieltjes $\gamma$ constants arising in the theory of the Riemann zeta function, and we also present some preliminary results on the asymptotic behavior of these constants.</p></details>

These notions are then naturally extended to subspace arrangements. In particular, we prove that the number of marked multi q-colorings of a subspace arrangement is a polynomial in q. We also define the (marked) independence series for subspace arrangements and prove that the (-q)-th power of the independence series of a hyperplane arrangement has non-negative coefficients.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Every Anderson $A$-motive $M$ over a field determines a compatible system of Galois representations on its Tate modules at almost all primes of $A$. This adapts easily to $F$-isocrystals, which are rational analogues of $A$-motives for the global function field $F:=\mathrm{Quot}(A)$. We extend this compatible system by constructing a Weil group representation associated to $M$ for every place of $F$. To this end we generalize the Tate module construction to a tensor functor on $F_{\mathfrak{p}}$-isocrystals that are not necessarily pure. To prove that this yields a compatible system, we work out how that construction behaves under reduction of $M$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We say that two elliptic curves $E$ and $F$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ are congruent modulo a prime $p$ if their $p$-torsion Galois modules (over the algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Q}$) are isomorphic. Such a congruence is called trivial if there is a rational isogeny between $E$ and $F$ with degree prime to $p$. A version of the Frey-Mazur conjecture states that any congruence modulo any prime $p \geq 19$ is trivial. Given an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ and a prime $p$, it is well-known that there is a twist of the classical modular curve $X(p)$ whose rational points describe the elliptic curves congruent to $E$ modulo $p$. In this article, we apply Mazur's strategy to determine the rational points of such a twisted modular curve under certain assumptions. In particular, we determine an explicit bound on the conductor of any elliptic curve congruent modulo $p$ to $y^2=x^3-p$ when $p$ is prime and congruent to $5$ modulo $9$, and deduce that any congruence modulo $23$ to $y^2=x^3-23$ is trivial.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $X=G/P$ be a partial flag variety, where $G$ is a semi-simple, simply connected algebraic group defined over an algebraically closed field $K$ of positive characteristic. Let $\mathsf{F}\colon X\to X$ be the absolute Frobenius morphism. Given a line bundle $\mathscr{L}$ on $X$ and an integer $r\geq1$, we describe all line bundles that are direct summands of the pushforward $\mathsf{F}_{*}^{r}\mathscr{L}$. For $\mathscr{L}$ corresponding to a dominant weight, we also compute, for $r$ sufficiently large, the multiplicity of $\mathscr{O}_{X}$ as a summand of $\mathsf{F}_{*}^{r}\mathscr{L}$. As an application we answer a question of Gros-Kaneda about the multiplcity of $\mathscr{L}(-\rho)$ as a direct summand of $\mathsf{F}_{*}\mathscr{O}_{G/B}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a complex Kac-Moody algebra, with Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$. Also fix a weight $\lambda\in\mathfrak{h}^*$. For $M(\lambda)\twoheadrightarrow V$ an arbitrary highest weight $\mathfrak{g}$-module, we provide a cancellation-free, non-recursive formula for the weights of $V$. This is novel even in finite type, and is obtained from $\lambda$ and a collection $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_V$ of independent sets in the Dynkin diagram of $\mathfrak{g}$ that are associated to $V$. Our proofs use and reveal a finite family (for each $\lambda$) of "higher order Verma modules" $\mathbb{M}(\lambda,\mathcal{H})$ - these are all of the universal modules for weight-considerations. They (i) generalize and subsume parabolic Verma modules $M(\lambda,J)$, and (ii) have pairwise distinct weight-sets, which exhaust the weight-sets of all modules $M(\lambda)\twoheadrightarrow V$. As an application, we explain the sense in which the modules $M(\lambda)$ of Verma and $M(\lambda,J_V)$ of Lepowsky are respectively the zeroth and first order upper-approximations of every $V$, and continue to higher order upper-approximations $\mathbb{M}_k(\lambda,\mathcal{H}_V)$ (and to lower-approximations). We determine every $k$th order integrability of $V$. We then introduce the category $\mathcal{O}^\mathcal{H}\subset\mathcal{O}$, which is a higher order parabolic analogue that contains the higher order Verma modules $\mathbb{M}(\lambda,\mathcal{H})$. We show that $\mathcal{O}^\mathcal{H}$ has enough projectives, and also initiate the study of BGG reciprocity, by proving it for all $\mathcal{O}^\mathcal{H}$ over $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_2^{\oplus n}$. Finally, we provide a BGG resolution for our universal modules $\mathbb{M}(\lambda,\mathcal{H})$ in certain cases including all rank-3 $\mathfrak{g}$; this yields their Weyl-type character formulas, with the actions of parabolic Weyl semigroups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is an introduction to the group algebras of the symmetric groups, written for a quarter-long graduate course. After recalling the definition of group algebras (and monoid algebras) in general, as well as basic properties of permutations, we introduce several families of elements in the symmetric group algebras $\mathbf{k}[S_n]$ such as the Young--Jucys--Murphy elements, the (sign-)integrals and the conjugacy class sums. Then comes a chapter on group actions and representations in general, followed by the core of this text: a study of the representations of symmetric groups (i.e., of left $\mathbf{k}[S_n]$-modules), including the classical theory of Young tableaux and Young symmetrizers. We prove in detail the main facts including the characterization of irreducible representations (in characteristic $0$), the Garnir relations, the standard basis theorem, the description of duals of Specht modules, and the hook length formula, as well as a number of less known results. Finally, we describe several bases of $\mathbf{k}[S_n]$ that arise from the study of Specht modules, including the Murphy cellular bases. The methods used are elementary and computational. We aim to assume as little as possible of the base ring $\mathbf{k}$, and to use as little as possible from representation theory (nothing more advanced than Maschke and Jordan--H\"older). Over 100 exercises (without solutions) are scattered through the text.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove Hypothesis H in full generality for ${\rm GL}_n$ over any number field. This result is a consequence of our stronger effective bound on Euler products involving Rankin--Selberg coefficients at prime ideal powers. The proof rests on a new analytic method, which employs a power sieve over number fields and an iterative argument to bypass the functoriality barrier that had restricted prior results to $n\leq 4$. As applications, we unconditionally establish the GUE statistics for automorphic $L$-function zeros, provide the first effective polynomial bound for the strong multiplicity one problem for coefficients, and resolve the Selberg orthogonality conjecture with stronger error terms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>When filtering a topological space by a single parameter, the theory of quiver representations provides a complete framework for decomposing the resulting persistence module to obtain its barcode. This is achieved by interpreting the persistence module as a representation of a Type $\mathbb{A}_n$ quiver. The complexity increases significantly when filtering by two or more parameters. In particular, multi-parameter persistence typically yields tame or wild type quivers whose indecomposable representations are more complicated to describe and for which arbitrary representations are much more difficult to decompose. The theme of this work is to provide a framework for restricting to subcategories of quiver representations whose objects can be distinguished from one another through computational means.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we construct a new family of sets via Diophantine approximation, in which the classical examples are endpoints. Our first application is on their Hausdorff dimension. We show a recent result of Ren and Wang, known sharp on orthogonal projections in the plane, is also sharp on $A+cB$, $c\in C$, thus completely settle this ABC sum-product problem. Higher dimensional examples are also discussed. In addition to Hausdorff dimension, we also consider Fourier dimension. In particular, now for every $0\leq t\leq s\leq 1$ we have an explicit construction in $\mathbb{R}$ of Hausdorff dimension $s$ and Fourier dimension $t$, together with a measure $\mu$ that captures both dimensions. In the end we give new sharpness examples for the Mockenhaupt-Mitsis-Bak-Seeger Fourier restriction theorem. In particular, to deal with the non-geometric case we construct measures of "Hausdorff dimension" $a$ and Fourier dimension $b$, even if $a<b$. This clarifies some difference between sets and measures.</p></details>

It is an open problem to study the denseness of $R(A)$ in the $p$-adic numbers when $A$ is the set of values attained by an integral form. In this paper we give a sufficient condition for the existence of infinitely many primes $p$ such that the ratio set of the values of an integral form is dense in $\mathbb{Q}_p$. We prove that if a form is non-singular and has at least three variables, then the ratio set of its values is dense in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for all sufficiently large $p$. We give two counterexamples to this statement if we do not assume non-singularity. The first one happens when the number of variables is equal to the degree. The other works for any number of variables but only for composite degrees, which motivates our conjecture that there are no such counterexamples of prime degree. Finally, we construct integral forms such that the ratio set of its values is dense in at least one $\mathbb{Q}_p$ but only in finitely many of them.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak g$ be a classical simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb F$ of characteristic zero or large enough, and let $\mathfrak n$ be a maximal nilpotent subalgebra of $\mathfrak g$. The main tool in representation theory of $\mathfrak n$ is the orbit method, which classifies primitive ideals in the universal enveloping algebra ${\rm U}(\mathfrak n)$ and unitary representations of the unipotent group $N=\exp(\mathfrak n)$ in terms of coadjoint orbits on the dual space $\mathfrak n^*$. In the paper, we describe explicitly coadjoint orbits of low dimension for $\mathfrak n$ as above. The answer is given in terms of subsets of positive roots. As a corollary, we provide a way to calculate the number of irreducible complex representations of dimensions $q$, $q^2$ and $q^3$ for a maximal unipotent subgroup $N(q)$ in a classical Chevalley group $G(q)$ over a finite field $\mathbb F_q$ with $q$ elements. It turned out that this number is a polynomial in $q-1$ with nonnegative integer coefficients, which agrees with Isaac's conjecture.</p></details>

We first show that when $r$ and $s$ are roots of unity, the algebra becomes a PI algebra, and we compute its PI degree explicitly using De Concini-Procesi method. We construct and classify finite-dimensional simple modules for $U^+_{r,s}(B_2)$ by analyzing a subalgebra $B\subset U^+_{r,s}(B_2)$. Simple modules are categorized into torsion-free and torsion types with respect to a distinguished normal element. We classify all torsion-free simple $B$-modules and lift them to $U^+_{r,s}(B_2)$. The remaining simple modules are constructed in the nilpotent case. This work provides a complete classification of simple $U^+_{r,s}(B_2)$-modules at roots of unity and contributes to the understanding of two-parameter quantum groups in type $B_2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A(q)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n q^n$ and $B(q)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_n q^n$ be two eta quotients. Previously, we considered the problem of when $$ a_n=0 <=> b_n=0. $$ Here we consider the ``mod $m$'' version of this problem, i.e. eta quotients $A(q)$ and $B(q)$ and integers $m>1$ such that $$ a_n \equiv 0 \pmod m <=> b_n \equiv 0 \pmod m? $$ We found results for $m=p^2$, $p=2, 3$ and $5$. For $m=4,9$, we found results which apply to infinite families of eta quotients. For example: Let $A(q)$ have the form \begin{equation} A(q) = f_1^{3j_1+1}\prod_{3\nmid i}f_i^{3j_i}\prod_{3|i}f_i^{j_i} =: \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_nq^n,\,\,B(q) = \frac{f_3}{f_1^3}A(q) =: \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_nq^n \end{equation} with $f_{k}=\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-q^{kn})$. Then \begin{align*} a_{3n}-b_{3n}&\equiv 0\pmod 9,\\ 2a_{3n+1}+b_{3n+1}&\equiv0\pmod 9,\\ a_{3n+2}+2b_{3n+2}&\equiv0\pmod 9. \end{align*} Some of these theorems also had some combinatorial implications, such as the following: Let $p_2^{(3)}(n)$ denote the number of bipartitions $(\pi_1, \pi_2)$ of $n$ where $\pi_1$ is 3-regular. Then \begin{equation*} p_2^{(3)}(n)\equiv0\pmod 9 <=> n\text{ is not a generalized pentagonal number}. \end{equation*} In the case of $m=25$, we do not have any general theorems that apply to an infinite family of eta quotients. Instead we give two tables of results that appear to hold experimentally. We do prove some individual results (using theory of modular forms), such as the following: Let the sequences $\{c_n\}$ and $\{d_n\}$ be defined by \begin{equation*} f_1^{10}=:\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_nq^n, \hspace{25pt} f_1^{5}f_5=:\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}d_nq^n. \end{equation*} Then \begin{equation*} c_n \equiv 0 \pmod{25} <=> d_n \equiv 0 \pmod{25}. \end{equation*}</p></details>

First, employing a transformation formula involving two Bailey pairs, we transform the partial Nahm sums into some specific Hecke-type series. Second, using two distinct approaches, we convert these Hecke-type series to the desired modular infinite products.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the notion of asymptotically positive infinite extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$, in the spirit of the Tsfasman-Vl\u{a}du\c{t} theory of asymptotically exact families of number fields. For asymptotically positive extensions, we obtain lower bounds on the logarithmic Weil height, establishing the Bogomolov property for a wide range of infinite non-Galois extensions. Our result encompasses the famous theorem of E. Bombieri and U. Zannier on Bogomolov property for totally $p$-adic extensions of type $(e,f)$. Additionally, our theorem can be interpreted as a $p$-adic equidistribution result on conjugates of $\alpha$, resonating with the archimedean equidistribution theorem \`{a} la F. Amoroso-M. Mignotte and Y. Bilu. In the parallel setting of elliptic curves, we derive lower bounds on the canonical height for points on an elliptic curve over asymptotically positive extensions, without any restriction on its reduction type. In particular, this extends a result of M. Baker in the context of totally $\nu$-adic extensions, where the elliptic curve is assumed to have semistable reduction at $\nu$.</p></details>

Thus, in each case the obtained structures interpolate between the well-known bases, Newton--Okounkov bodies or degenerations associated with the latter two polytopes.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The solution to the general univariate polynomial equation has been sought for centuries. It is well known there is no general solution in radicals for degrees five and above. The hyper-Catalan numbers $C[m_2,m_3,m_4,\ldots]$ count the ways to subdivide a planar polygon into exactly $m_2$ triangles, $m_3$ quadrilaterals, $m_4$ pentagons, etc. Wildberger and Rubine (2025) show the generating series $\mathbf{S}$ of the hyper-Catalan numbers is a formal series zero of the general geometric polynomial (meaning, general except for a constant of $1$ and a linear coefficient of $-1$). Using a variant of the series solution to the geometric polynomial that has the number of vertices, edges, and faces explicitly shown, We prove their infinite series result may be viewed as a finite identity at each level, where a level is a truncation of $\mathbf{S}$ to a given maximum number of vertices, edges, or faces (bounded by degree). We illustrate this result, as well as the general correspondence between operations on sets of subdivided polygons and the algebra of polynomials, with figures and animations generated using Python.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In recent work, the author, in collaboration with Allen, Long, and Tu, developed the Explicit Hypergeometric Modularity Method (EHMM), which establishes the modularity of a large class of hypergeometric Galois representations in dimensions two and three. One important application of the EHMM is the construction of an explicit family of eta-quotients, which we call the $\mathbb{K}_{2}$ functions, from the hypergeometric background. In this article, we introduce an analogous family of eta-quotients, which we call the $\mathbb{K}_{3}$ functions. These $\mathbb{K}_{3}$ functions are constructed using the theory of weight one cubic theta functions originally developed by Jonathan and Peter Borwein. We then use the $\mathbb{K}_{3}$ functions in the EHMM to resolve several hypergeometric modularity conjectures of Dawsey and McCarthy. Further, we provide applications to special $L$-values of the $\mathbb{K}_{3}$ functions and to the study of generalized Paley graphs.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we generalize the arithmetic degree and its related theory to dynamical systems defined over an arbitrary field $\mathbf{k}$ of characteristic $0$. We first consider a dynamical system $(X,f)$ over a finitely generated field $K$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, we introduce the arithmetic degrees $\alpha(f,\cdot)$ for $\overline{K}$-points by using Moriwaki heights. We study the arithmetic dynamical degree of $(X,f)$ and establish the relative degree formula. The relative degree formula gives a proof of the fundamental inequality, that is, the upper arithmetic degree $\overline{\alpha}(f,x)$ is less than or equal to the first dynamical degree $\lambda_1(f)$ in this setting. By taking spread-outs, we extend the definition of arithmetic degrees to dynamical systems over the field $\mathbf k$. We demonstrate that our definition is independent of the choice of the spread-out. Moreover, in this setting, we prove certain special cases of the Kawaguchi-Silverman conjecture. A main novelty of this paper is that, we give a characterization of arithmetic degrees of "transcendental points" in the case $\mathbf{k}=\mathbb{C}$, from which we deduce that $\alpha(f,x)=\lambda_1(f)$ for very general $x\in X(\mathbb{C})$ when $f$ is an endomorphism.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe a general method for giving $p$-adic interpretations of $G$-functions arising from degenerating periods of smooth projective algebraic varieties. Using this, we are able to implement a strategy due to Andr\'e for bounding heights of moduli points where period functions acquire unusual algebraic relations. This leads to new results on Galois lower bounds for special moduli, and new cases of the Zilber-Pink conjecture. In particular, we establish the first Galois-orbit lower bounds on CM moduli in non-Shimura settings. As a more technical contribution, we introduce a refinement of the Pila-Zannier strategy capable of handling Zilber-Pink-type atypical intersection problems in arbitrary dimension and for arbitrary smooth projective families.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study the restriction of modular forms such as Ikeda type lifts and the Eisenstein series on the exceptional group of type $E_{7,3}$ to the symplectic group $Sp_6$ (rank 3). As an application, we explicitly write down the restriction when modular forms have small weight. The restriction may contain Miyawaki lifts of type I,II (CAP forms) and genuine forms whose description is compatible with Arthur's classification.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate a new theta cycle for $GSp_4/\mathbb{Q}$ by using author's theta operators defined in the previous work. In the course of the construction, we also modify the theta operators so that they work in any characteristic, including $p = 2$, and for any weight. As an application, we discuss an Edixhoven type theorem for $GSp_4/\mathbb{Q}$.</p></details>
