 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Moustapha Diallo, Brian McDonald &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.CO &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The VC-dimension, introduced by Vapnik and Chervonenkis in 1968 in the context of learning theory, has in recent years provided a rich source of problems in combinatorial geometry. Given $E\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$ or $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, finding lower bounds on the VC-dimension of hypothesis classes defined by geometric objects such as spheres and hyperplanes is equivalent to constructing appropriate geometric configurations in $E$. The complexity of these configurations increases exponentially with the VC-dimension. These questions are related to the Erdős distance problem and the Falconer problem when considering a hypothesis class defined by spheres. In particular, the Erdős distance problem over finite fields is equivalent to showing that the VC-dimension of translates of a sphere of radius $t$ is at least one for all nonzero $t\in \mathbb{F}_q$. In this paper, we show that many of the existing techniques for distance problems over finite fields can be extended to a much broader context, not relying on the specific geometry of circles and spheres. We provide a unified framework which allows us to simultaneously study highly structured sets such as algebraic curves, as well as random sets.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Jessica Alessandrì, Daniel Loughran &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the Diophantine equation $x^4 + y^4 - w^2 = n$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, which is related to near misses for the quartic case of Fermat's Last Theorem. For certain $n$ we show that the set of solutions is infinite, or more generally not thin. Our approach is via the geometry of del Pezzo surfaces of degree $2$, and we prove a more general result on non-thinness of integral points on double conic bundle surfaces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe all of the irreducible polynomial $\mathbb{F}_p\mathrm{SL}_2(p^r)$ representations which lift to $(\mathbb{Z}/p^s\mathbb{Z})\mathrm{SL}_2(p^r)$ representations for $s>1$, observing that they almost never do. We also show that two related indecomposable $\mathbb{F}_p \mathrm{SL}_2(p^r)$ representations cannot be lifted to $\mathbb{Z}/p^s\mathbb{Z}$ representations for $s>1$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sebastián Carrillo Santana, Gunther Cornelissen, Berend Ringeling &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 57 pages, 8 figures (v2: many small changes, based on comments of readers)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider a set of generators for the space of Eisenstein series of even weight $k$ for any congruence group $Γ$ and study the set of all of their zeros taken for $Γ(1)$-conjugates of $Γ$ in the standard fundamental domain for $Γ(1)$. We describe (a) an upper bound $κ_Γ+ O(1/k)$ for their imaginary part; (b) a finite configuration of geodesics segments to which all zeros converge in Hausdorff distance as $k \rightarrow \infty$; (c) a finite set containing all algebraic zeros for all weights. The bound in (a) depends on the (non-)vanishing of a new generalization of Ramanujan sums. The proof of (b) originates in a method used to study phase transitions in statistical physics. The proof of (c) relies on the theory of complex multiplication. The results can be made quantitative for specific groups. For $Γ=Γ(N)$ with $4 \nmid N$, $κ_Γ=1$ and the zeros tend to the unit circle, whereas if $4 \mid N$, $κ_Γ=2$ and the limit configuration includes parts of vertical geodesics and circles of radius $2$. In both cases, the only algebraic zeros are at $\mathrm{i}$ and $\exp(2π\mathrm{i}/3)$ for sufficiently large $k$. For $Γ(N)$ with $N$ odd, we use finer estimates to prove a trichotomy for the exact `convergence speed' of the zeros to the unit circle, as well as angular equidistribution of the zeros as $k \rightarrow \infty$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Daniel E. Martin &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 62 pages. Typos from version 1 have been fixed, and further explanation has been added to certain proofs. Sage code for Algorithm 1 is on the author's webpage: dem6.people.clemson.edu

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2013, Darryl McCullough and Marcus Wanderley made a series of conjectures that describe the Nielsen equivalence classes and $T_2$-equivalence classes of pairs of generators for $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and the Markoff equivalence classes of triples in $\mathbb{F}_q^3$ that solve $x^2+y^2+z^2=xyz+κ$ for some $κ\in\mathbb{F}_q$. (The case $κ=0$ was originally conjectured by Baragar in 1991.) We prove that one of the McCullough-Wanderley conjectures, the "Q-Classification Conjecture" on Markoff triples, implies the others. Then we prove that the Q-Classification Conjecture holds if $q=p$ is a prime such that $24{,}504{,}480$ does not divide $p^2-1$. More generally, for any integer $d$, we reduce the Q-Classification Conjecture for all primes $p\not\equiv \pm 1\,\text{mod}\,d$ to checking whether a roughly $2d\times 2d$ matrix with entries in $\mathbb{Q}[κ]$ is invertible. We (and SageMath) perform this invertibility check for all prime powers $d$ up to $17$, hence the modulus $24{,}504{,}480=2\text{lcm}(1,2,\dots,17)$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sidney A. Morris, Marcelo O. Ribeiro, Diego Marques &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the arithmetic behavior of self-powers $x^x$ when $x$ is a Liouville number. Using recent ideas on strengthened Liouville approximation, we develop flexible constructions that illuminate how transcendence, Liouville properties, and "large" topological size interact in this setting. As a concrete outcome, we build a perfect set of Liouville numbers of continuum cardinality whose finite sums, finite products, and self-powers all remain Liouville. These results show that rich algebraic and topological structures persist inside the Liouville universe for the map $x\mapsto x^x$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 59 pages, corrections taking into account referee reports, treatment of Eisenstein series simplified, to appear in Annales Scientifiques de l'ENS

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the Mixing Conjecture of Michel--Venkatesh for the class group action on Heegner points of large discriminant on compact arithmetic surfaces attached to maximal orders in rational quaternion algebras. The proof is conditional on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, and when the division algebra is indefinite we furthermore assume the Ramanujan conjecture. Our methods, which provide an effective rate, are based on the spectral theory of automorphic forms and their $L$-functions, as well as techniques in classical analytic number theory.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kestutis Cesnavicius, Roman Fedorov &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 24 pages; final version, to appear in the Journal of the European Mathematical Society; updated the numbering scheme to match the journal version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Grothendieck-Serre conjecture predicts that every generically trivial torsor under a reductive group $G$ over a regular semilocal ring $R$ is trivial. We establish this for unramified $R$ granted that $G^{\mathrm{ad}}$ is totally isotropic, that is, has a "maximally transversal" parabolic $R$-subgroup. We also use purity for the Brauer group to reduce the conjecture for unramified $R$ to simply connected $G$--a much less direct such reduction of Panin had been a step in solving the equal characteristic case of Grothendieck-Serre. We base the group-theoretic aspects of our arguments on the geometry of the stack $\mathrm{Bun}_G$, instead of the affine Grassmannian used previously, and we quickly reprove the crucial weak $\mathbb{P}^1$-invariance input: for any reductive group $H$ over a semilocal ring $A$, every $H$-torsor $\mathscr{E}$ on $\mathbb{P}^1_A$ satisfies $\mathscr{E}|_{\{t = 0\}} \simeq \mathscr{E}|_{\{t = \infty\}}$. For the geometric aspects, we develop reembedding and excision techniques for relative curves with finiteness weakened to quasi-finiteness, thus overcoming a known obstacle in mixed characteristic, and show that every generically trivial torsor over $R$ under a totally isotropic $G$ trivializes over every affine open of $\mathrm{Spec}(R) \setminus Z$ for some closed $Z$ of codimension $\ge 2$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ryuji Tanimoto &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic $p$ and let $\mathbb{G}_a$ denote the additive group of $k$. Let $n \geq 1$ and let ${\rm Mat}(n, k[T])^E$ denote the set of all exponential matrices of ${\rm Mat}(n, k[T])$. Let $\mathbb{E}_{\geq 0}(n, k)$ denote the set of all group homomorphisms from $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^r$ to ${\rm GL}(n, k)$, where $r$ ranges over all non-negative integers. In the first, we show that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the set ${\rm Mat}(n, k[T])^E$ and the set of all $\mathbb{G}_a$-actions on $\mathbb{P}^{n - 1}$. In the second, we show that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between $\mathbb{E}_{\geq 0}(n, k)$ and the set ${\rm Mat}(n, k[T])^E \times \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** presented at the 25th Conference Applications of Logic in Philosophy and the Foundations of Mathematics, arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1109.3826, arXiv:1404.5975

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $n \in N$, let $E_n=\{1=x_k,~x_i+x_j=x_k,~x_i \cdot x_j=x_k:~i,j,k \in \{0,...,n\}\}$. For $n \in N$, $f(n)$ denotes the smallest $b\in N$ such that if a system of equations $S \subseteq E_n$ has a solution in $N^{n+1}$, then $S$ has a solution in $\{0,...,b\}^{n+1}$. The author proved earlier that the function $f:N \to N$ is computable in the limit and eventually dominates every computable function $g:N \to N$. We present a short program which for $n \in N$ prints the sequence $\{f_i(n)\}_{i=0}^\infty$ of non-negative integers converging to $f(n)$. Since $f$ is not computable, no algorithm takes as input non-negative integers $n$ and $m$ and decides whether or not $\forall (x_0,...,x_n) \in N^{n+1}$ $\exists (y_0,...,y_n) \in \{0,...,m\}^{n+1}$ $(\forall k \in \{0,...,n\}$ $(1=x_k \Rightarrow 1=y_k))~\wedge$ $(\forall i,j,k \in \{0,...,n\}$ $(x_i+x_j=x_k \Rightarrow y_i+y_j=y_k))~\wedge$ $(\forall i,j,k \in \{0,...,n\}$ $(x_i \cdot x_j=x_k \Rightarrow y_i \cdot y_j=y_k))$. Similarly, no algorithm takes as input non-negative integers $n$ and $m$ and decides whether or not $\forall (x_0,...,x_n) \in N^{n+1}$ $\exists (y_0,...,y_n) \in \{0,...,m\}^{n+1}$ $(\forall j,k \in \{0,...,n\}$ $(x_j+1=x_k \Rightarrow y_j+1=y_k)) ~\wedge$ $(\forall i,j,k \in \{0,...,n\}$ $(x_i \cdot x_j=x_k \Rightarrow y_i \cdot y_j=y_k))$. For $n \in N$, $β(n)$ denotes the smallest $b \in N$ such that if a system of equations $S\subseteq E_n$ has a unique solution in $N^{n+1}$, then this solution belongs to $\{0,...,b\}^{n+1}$. The author proved earlier that the function $β: N \to N$ is computable in the limit and eventually dominates every function $δ: N \to N$ with a single-fold Diophantine representation. The computability of $β$ is unknown. We present a short program which for $n \in N$ prints the sequence $\{β_i(n)\}_{i=0}^\infty$ of non-negative integers converging to $β(n)$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 47 pages. The article "Fedder type criterion for quasi-$F$-splitting" has been split into two parts. To appear in Amer. J. Math

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Yobuko recently introduced the notion of quasi-$F$-splitting and quasi-$F$-split heights, which generalize and quantify the notion of Frobenius-splitting, and proved that quasi-$F$-split heights coincide with Artin-Mazur heights for Calabi-Yau varieties. In this paper, we prove Fedder type criteria for quasi-$F$-splittings of complete intersections, and in particular, obtain a simple formula to compute Artin-Mazur heights of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces. As one of its applications, we prove that there exist Calabi-Yau varieties of arbitrarily high Artin-Mazur height over $\mathbb{F}_2$. We also give explicit defining equations of quartic K3 surfaces over $\mathbb{F}_{3}$ realizing all the possible Artin-Mazur heights.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we give an expository presentation of the paper of Olivier Mathieu.

To give Mathieu's proof, we first review the required literature on representation theory in an expository way. We continue to prove some results on the irreducible subrepresentations of the tensor algebra of the standard representation of $SL(N,\mathbb{C})$. The last part of the paper is dedicated to Mathieu's proof.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We determine the structure of the BPS algebra of 2-Calabi-Yau Abelian categories for which the stack of objects admits a good moduli space. We prove that this algebra is isomorphic to the positive part of the enveloping algebra of a generalised Kac-Moody Lie algebra generated by the intersection cohomology of certain connected components (corresponding to roots) of the good moduli space. Some major examples include the BPS algebras of (1) the category of semistable coherent sheaves of given slope on a K3 surface or, more generally, quasiprojective symplectic surface, (2) semistable Higgs bundles on a smooth projective curve, (3) preprojective algebras of quivers, (4) multiplicative preprojective algebras and (5) fundamental groups of (quiver) Riemann surfaces. We define the BPS Lie algebras of 2-Calabi-Yau categories and prove that they coincide with the ones obtained by dimensional reduction from the critical cohomological Hall algebra in the case in which the 2-Calabi-Yau category is the category of representations of a preprojective algebra. Consequences include (1) A proof in full generality of the Bozec-Schiffmann positivity conjecture for absolutely cuspidal polynomials, a strengthening of the Kac positivity conjecture (2) A proof of the cohomological integrality conjecture for the category of semistable coherent sheaves on local K3 surfaces (3) A description of the cohomology (in all degrees) of Nakajima quiver varieties as direct sums of irreducible lowest weight representations over the BPS Lie algebra.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-11-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Ben Davison, Lucien Hennecart, Sebastian Schlegel Mejia &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** v3: 78 pages, lots of improvements. v2: 77 pages, minor corrections. v1: 76 pages all comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define and study a sheaf-theoretic cohomological Hall algebra for suitably geometric Abelian categories $\mathcal{A}$ of homological dimension at most two, and a sheaf-theoretic BPS algebra under the conditions that $\mathcal{A}$ is 2-Calabi-Yau and has a good moduli space. We show that the BPS algebra for the preprojective algebra $Π_Q$ of a totally negative quiver is the free algebra generated by the intersection cohomology of the closure of the locus parameterising simple $Π_Q$-modules in the coarse moduli space. We define and study the BPS Lie algebra of arbitrary 2-Calabi-Yau categories $\mathcal{A}$ for which the Euler form is negative on all pairs of non-zero objects, which recovers the BPS algebra as its universal enveloping algebra for such "totally negative" 2CY categories. We show that for totally negative 2CY categories the BPS algebra is freely generated by intersection complexes of certain coarse moduli spaces as above, and the Borel-Moore homology of the stack of objects in such $\mathcal{A}$ satisfies a Yangian-type PBW theorem for the BPS Lie algebra. In this way we prove the cohomological integrality theorem for these categories. We use our results to prove that for $C$ a smooth projective curve, and for $r$ and $d$ not necessarily coprime, there is a nonabelian Hodge isomorphism between the Borel-Moore homologies of the stack of rank $r$ and degree $d$ Higgs bundles, and the appropriate stack of twisted representations of the fundamental group of $C$. In addition we prove the Bozec-Schiffmann positivity conjecture for totally negative quivers; we prove that their polynomials counting cuspidal functions in the constructible Hall algebra for $Q$ have positive coefficients, strengthening the positivity theorem for the Kac polynomials of such quivers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 15 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For primes $p$ and $\ell$ such that $\ell$ divides $p-1$, Hirano and Morishita constructed a nonabelian Galois extension of the function field $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$ whose degree is $\ell^3$ and Galois group is of Heisenberg type. Here we analyze how primes of degree one decompose in such extensions. It amounts to investigating the decomposition of the principal ideal $(t-a)$ for $a \in \mathbb{F}_p-\{0,1\}$ and our main result determines when it decomposes completely in terms of an explicit polynomial in $a$. It is reminiscent of Euler's criterion. The proof relies on both the group structure of the mod-$\ell$ Heisenberg group and the arithmetic of field extensions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We conjecture affine or Hall-Littlewood analogues of the dual Jacobi-Trudi formulas for orthogonal and symplectic Schur functions indexed by rectangular partitions of maximal height. These conjectures are then used to derive $t$-analogues of many known Rogers-Ramanujan identities for the characters of standard modules of affine Lie algebras. This includes $t$-analogues of the classical Rogers-Ramanujan identities, (some of) the Andrews-Gordon identities and the $\mathrm{C}_n^{(1)}$, $\mathrm{A}_{2n}^{(2)}$ and $\mathrm{D}_{n+2}^{(2)}$ GOW identities. We also prove an affine analogue of the dual Jacobi-Trudi formula for Schur functions indexed by rectangular partitions of arbitrary height.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We generalize the theory of integer $C$-, $G$-matrices in cluster algebras to the real case. By a skew-symmetrizing method, we can reduce the problem of skew-symmetrizable patterns to the one of skew-symmetric patterns. In this sense, we extend the sign-coherence of integer $C$-, $G$-matrices proved by Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich to a more general real class called of quasi-integer type. Furthermore, we give a complete classification of this type by a combinatorial method of real weighted quivers. However, the sign-coherence of real $C$-, $G$-matrices does not always hold in general. For this purpose, we classify all the rank $2$ case and the finite type case via the Coxeter diagrams. We also give two conjectures about the real exchange matrices and $C$-, $G$-matrices. Under these conjectures, the dual mutation, $G$-fan structure and synchronicity property hold. As an application, the isomorphism of several kinds of exchange graphs is studied.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Assuming the Riemann Hypothesis (RH), Montgomery proved a theorem in 1973 concerning the pair correlation of zeros of the Riemann zeta-function and applied this to prove that at least $2/3$ of the zeros are simple. In this paper, we investigate the versatility of the pair correlation method and show, for the first time, that it can be used to prove results on the \emph{horizontal distribution} of zeros of the Riemann zeta-function. In earlier work we showed how to remove RH from Montgomery's theorem and, in turn, obtain results on simple zeros assuming conditions on the zeros that are weaker than RH. Here we assume a more general condition, namely that all the zeros $ρ= β+iγ$ with $T<γ\le 2T$ are in a narrow vertical box centered on the critical line with width $b/\log T$, where $b\to 0$ as $T\to \infty$. We first prove the generalization of Montgomery's result that at least $2/3$ of zeros are simple, and we then prove the new result that the pair correlation method yields at least $2/3$ of the zeros on the critical line. We also use the pair correlation method to prove that at least $1/3$ of the zeros are both simple and on the critical line, a result already known unconditionally using different methods.</p></details>

We also characterize skew-Brauer algebras of finite representation type.

Specializing to $SL_{2, F} \subset \mathrm{Res}_{E/F} SL_{2, E}$, we show that the truncated geometric RTF distribution converges, and is given by a linear polynomial in the truncation parameter. We then compute the fine geometric expansion explicitly, including the contribution of the regularized relative unipotent orbital integrals. We propose a geometric viewpoint which guided the computation of these unipotent terms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A nut graph is a nontrivial simple graph whose adjacency matrix has a simple eigenvalue zero such that the corresponding eigenvector has no zero entries. It is known that the order $n$ and degree $d$ of a vertex-transitive nut graph satisfy $4 \mid d$, $d \ge 4$, $2 \mid n$ and $n \ge d + 4$; or $d \equiv 2 \pmod 4$, $d \ge 6$, $4 \mid n$ and $n \ge d + 6$. Here, we prove that for each such $n$ and $d$, there exists a $d$-regular Cayley nut graph of order $n$.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A famous conjecture of Erd\H os and Straus is that for every integer $n\ge2$, $4/n$ can be represented as $1/x+1/y+1/z$, where $x,y,z$ are positive integers. This conjecture was generalized to $5/n$ by Sierpiński, and then Schinzel conjectured that for every integer $m\ge4$ there is a bound $n_m$ such that the fraction $m/n$ is the sum of 3 unit fractions for all integers $n\ge n_m$. Leveraging and generalizing work of Elsholtz and Tao, we show that if $n_m$ exists it must be at least $\exp(m^{1/3+o(1)})$; that is, there are numbers $n$ this large for which $m/n$ is not the sum of 3 unit fractions. We prove a weaker, but numerically explicit version of this theorem, showing that for $m\ge 6.52\times10^9$ there is a prime $p\in(m^2,2m^2)$ with $m/p$ not the sum of 3 unit fractions, and report on some extensive numerical calculations that support this assertion with the much smaller bound $m\ge19$. In addition we generalize a result of Vaughan to show that for each $m$, most $n$'s have $m/n$ representable, and we prove a result generalizing the problem to the sum of $j$ unit fractions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the \textit{Fibonacci Quarterly} in 1964, C.~R.~Wall gave the following weighted sum of generalized Fibonacci numbers: $\sum_{i=1}^n i G_i = n G_{n+2} - G_{n+3} + G_3$, where $\left(G_n\right)_{n \geq 0}$ is defined by the recurrence $G_n = G_{n-1} + G_{n-2}$ with fixed $G_0, G_1 \in \mathbb{Z}$. In this paper, we generalize Wall's result to the Lucas sequences of the first and second kind, $\left(U_n(p,q)\right)_{n \geq 0}$ and $\left(V_n(p,q)\right)_{n \geq 0}$, and give closed forms for $\sum_{i=1}^n i U_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n i V_i$ by using Abel's summation by parts method. Moreover, we provide concrete applications, not only recovering the known weighted sums $\sum_{i=1}^n i F_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n i L_i$ of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, respectively, but also add new identities to the literature for eight well-known sequences. In particular, we give closed forms for weighted sums of Lucas sequences of the first kind such as the Pell, balancing, Jacobstahl, and Mersenne numbers, and also Lucas sequences of the second kind such as the companion Pell, double Lucas-balancing, Jacobstahl-Lucas, and Mersenne-Lucas numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove a determinantal, Toda-type, presentation for the equivariant K theory of a partial flag variety ${\rm Fl}(r_1, \dots, r_k;n)$. The proof relies on pushing forward the Toda presentation obtained by Maeno, Naito and Sagaki for the complete flag variety ${\rm Fl}(n)$, via Kato's ${\rm K}_T({\rm pt})$-algebra homomorphism from the quantum K ring of ${\rm Fl}(n)$ to that of ${\rm Fl}(r_1, \dots, r_k;n)$. Starting instead from the Whitney presentation for ${\rm Fl}(n)$, we show that the same pushforward technique gives a recursive formula for polynomial representatives of quantum K Schubert classes in any partial flag variety which do not depend on quantum parameters. In an appendix, we include another proof of the Toda presentation for the equivariant quantum K ring of ${\rm Fl}(n)$, following Anderson, Chen, and Tseng, which is based on the fact that the ${\rm K}$-theoretic $J$-function is an eigenfunction of the finite difference Toda Hamiltonians.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(a_n)_{n \geq 1}$ be a sequence of distinct positive integers. The metric theory of minimal gaps for the sequence $\{αa_n \text{ mod }1, 1\leq n \leq N\}$ as $N \to \infty$ was initiated by Rudnick, who established that the minimal gap admits an asymptotic upper bound expressible in terms of the additive energy of $\{a_1,\ldots,a_N\}$ for almost every $α$. Later, Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch demonstrated that the metric theory of minimal gaps for such sequences is governed not by the additive energy, but by the cardinality of the difference set of $\{a_1,\ldots,a_N\}$. They established a sharp convergence test for the typical asymptotic order of the minimal gap and proved general upper and lower bounds that are readily applicable. A key element of their proof relies on the resolution of the Duffin--Schaeffer conjecture by Koukoulopoulos and Maynard. In this article, we generalise several results from the article of Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch on \emph{integer} sequences to the case of \emph{real} sequences. While an upper bound for $δ_{\min}^α(N)$ remains elusive, we obtain one for its floored counterpart $\lfloor δ^α_{\min} \rfloor (N)$ for real sequences $(a_n)_{n \geq 1}$ of distinct numbers. Our theorems recover Theorems 1-3, as well as the result from Section 4.3 of the article by Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds for the minimal gaps of well-spaced sequences and, more generally, of a broader family that contains them.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The lonely runner conjecture of Wills and Cusick asserts that if $n$ runners with distinct constant speeds run around a a circular unit length track, starting at a common time and place, then each runner will at some time be separated by a distance of at least $\frac{1}{n}$ from all other runners. A weaker lower bound of $\frac{1}{2n-2}$ follows from the so-called trivial union bound, and subsequent work upgraded this to bounds of the form $\frac{1}{2n}+\frac{c}{n^2}$ for various constants $c>0$. Tao strengthened this to $\frac{1}{2n}+\frac{(\log n)^{1-o(1)}}{n^2}$. In this paper, we obtain a polynomial improvement of the form $$\frac{1}{2n}+\frac{1}{n^{5/3+o(1)}}.$$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper investigates the conditions under which a given circular (synchronizing) DFA is \emph{simple} (sometimes referred to as \emph{primitive}) and when it is \emph{irreducible}. Our notion of irreducibility slightly differs from the classical one, since we are considering our monoid representations to be over $\mathbb{C}$ instead of $\mathbb{Q}$; nevertheless, several well-known results remain valid-for instance, the fact that every irreducible automaton is necessarily simple. We provide a complete characterization of simplicity in the circular case by means of the \emph{weak contracting property}. Furthermore, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for a circular \emph{contracting automaton} (a stronger condition than the weakly contracting one) to be irreducible, and we present examples illustrating our results.</p></details>

We further prove that the possible overlining patterns on the distinct blocks are counted by Fibonacci numbers, giving natural bijections with independent sets on paths, pattern-avoiding binary words, and Fibonacci tilings.</p></details>

As usual, $ψ(x;q,a):=\sum_{n\leqslant x,n\equiv a(\!\!\!\mod{\!\!q})}Λ(n)$, where $Λ$ is the von Mangoldt function. In 2003, Friedlander and Iwaniec assumed the existence of exceptional characters corresponding to "extreme" Landau-Siegel zeroes and established a meaningful asymptotic formula for $ψ(x;q,a)$ beyond the square-root barrier of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. In particular, their asymptotic yields non-trivial information for moduli $q\leqslant x^{1/2+1/231}$. In this paper, we considerably relax the extremity of the Landau-Siegel zero required in the work of Friedlander and Iwaniec and obtain a conditional asymptotic formula for $ψ(x;q,a)$ in a slightly wider range of $q$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Choie and Kumar extensively studied the Herglotz-Zagier-Novikov function $\mathfrak{F}(z;u,v)$, defined as \begin{align*} \mathfrak{F}(z;u,v) = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\log(1-ut^z)}{v^{-1}-t} dt, \quad \textrm{for} \quad \mathfrak{Re}(z)>0. \end{align*} They obtained two-term, three-term and six-term functional equations for $\mathfrak{F}(z;u,v)$ and also evaluated special values in terms of di-logarithmic functions. Motivated from their work, we study the following two integrals, \begin{align*} \mathfrak{F}(z;u,v,w) &=\int_{0}^1 \frac{\log(1-ut^z)\log(1-wt^z)}{v^{-1}-t}\text{d}t, \\ \mathfrak{F}_k(z;u,v) &= \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\log^k(1-ut^z)}{v^{-1}-t} \, \text{d}t, \end{align*} for $\mathfrak{Re}(z)>0$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$. For $k=1$, the integral $\mathfrak{F}_k(z;u,v)$ reduces to $\mathfrak{F}(z;u,v)$. This allows us to recover the properties of $\mathfrak{F}(z;u,v)$ by studying the properties of $\mathfrak{F}_k(z;u,v)$. We evaluate special values of these two functions in terms of poly-logarithmic functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, the two settings we are concerned with are $Γ< \mathrm{SO}(n, 1)$ a Zariski dense Schottky semigroup and $Γ< \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb C)$ a Zariski dense continued fractions semigroup. In both settings, we prove a uniform asymptotic counting formula for the associated congruence subsemigroups, generalizing the work of Magee-Oh-Winter [arXiv:1601.03705] in $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb R)$ to higher dimensions. Superficially, the proof requires two separate strategies: the expander machinery of Golsefidy-Varjú, based on the work of Bourgain-Gamburd-Sarnak, and Dolgopyat's method. However, there are several challenges in higher dimensions. Firstly, using the expander machinery requires a key input: the Zariski density and full trace field property of the return trajectory subgroups, newly introduced in [arXiv:2006.07787]. Secondly, we need to adapt Stoyanov's version of Dolgopyat's method to circumvent some technical issues while the main difficulty is to prove the key inputs: the local non-integrability condition (LNIC) and the non-concentration property (NCP).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Since the invention of the famous LLL algorithm, lattice reduction has been an extremely useful tool in computational number theory. By construction, the LLL algorithm deals with lattices living in a vector space endowed with a positive definite scalar product. However, it seems quite nature to ask about the indefinite case, where the scalar product is replaced by an arbitrary quadratic form, possibily indefinite. This question was considered independently in two lines of work. One by G{á}bor Ivanyos and {Á}gnes Sz{á}nt{ó} and one by Denis Simon. Both lead to an algorithm that generalizes LLL and whose performance is very similar to LLL, i.e. a polynomial-time algorithm that approximates the shortest vector within an approximation factor exponential in the dimension. Denis Simon achieves an approximation factor close to that of LLL under the assumption that no isotropic vectors arise during reduction. G{á}bor Ivanyos and {Á}gnes Sz{á}nt{ó} show that it is possible to avoid isotropic vectors altogether, at the cost of a somewhat worse approximation factor. In this paper, we revisit the reduction of indefinite lattices and conclude that it can lead to much better reduced representations that previously thought. We also conclude that the approximation factor depends on the signature of the indefinite lattice rather than on its dimension.</p></details>

Some basic properties of this correspondence are discussed. We also calculate the Hausdorff dimensions for the images of some subsets of the infinite sequences under this correspondence. As a result of this correspondence, we are able to determine the limits for a number of natural multiple integrals. Our analysis also reveals that the set of multiple zeta-star values is dense within the $(1,+\infty)$ domain, and that each value is non-integer in nature.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Landau-Selberg-Delange method gives precise asymptotic formulas for the partial sums $\sum_{n \le x} \, a_n$ of a Dirichlet series $\sum_n \, a_n/n^s$ that behaves like a complex power of the Riemann zeta function. However, situations often arise when the Dirichlet series behaves like a product of complex powers of several Dirichlet $L$-functions to a modulus $q$. In such situations, one often requires sharp asymptotic formulas for the partial sums $\sum_{n \le x} \, a_n$ that apply in much wider ranges of $q$ than permitted by known forms of the Landau-Selberg-Delange method. In this manuscript, we address this problem, giving new estimates on $\sum_{n \le x} \, a_n$ in ranges of $q$ that are (in most applications) much wider than attainable from previous results. Our results also weaken certain hypotheses on the size of $\{a_n\}_n$. As applications of our main theorems, we extend Landau's classical results on the distribution of integers with prime factors restricted to progressions, and improve upon Chang, Martin and Nguyen's work on the distributions of the least invariant factors and least primary factors of multiplicative groups. We also extend the classical Sathe-Selberg theorem and study the local laws of the functions $Ω_a(n)$ and $ω_a(n)$, that count (with and without multiplicity, respectively), the number of prime divisors of $n$ lying in the progression $a$ mod $q$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using the Tannakian formalism, we formulate conjectural analogs of Chebotarëv's Density Theorem for $F$-isocrystals over a smooth geometrically irreducible variety defined over a finite field. We prove these analogs for several large classes, including (a) constant $F$-isocrystals, (b) direct sums of isoclinic convergent $F$-isocrystals, (c) semi-simple overconvergent $F$-isocrystals, and (d) semi-simple convergent $F$-isocrystals which have an overconvergent extension. Case (a) is a generalization of the Mordell-Lang Conjecture for tori and enters in the proofs of (b) and (c). For (b) we use the classical Chebotarëv Density Theorem, and point counting techniques in $p$-adic Lie groups building on a result of Oesterlé. For (c) we give two proofs. One of them uses deep input on the Langlands correspondence by Abe and Lafforgue, and the theory of Frobenius weights of Kedlaya, Abe and Caro. Building on this we formulate and prove the $p$-adic analog of Deligne's Equidistribution Theorem. Then (c) follows by applying real algebraic geometry to maximal compact subgroups in complex algebraic groups, measure theory, and a convergence result on complex hypersurfaces. For (d) we develop the theory of maximal quasi-tori (generalizing maximal tori in non-connected linear algebraic groups) and use D'Addezio's result on Crew's parabolicity conjecture to reduce to (b). These arguments also yield a second proof of (c). Besides of the deep inputs mentioned above and some Tannakian arguments, our main technique is the theory of linear algebraic groups. We include a comparison with the recent article of Cadoret and Tamagawa on the same topic.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The low-energy expansion of genus-one string amplitudes produces infinite families of non-holomorphic modular forms after each step of integrating over a point on the torus worldsheet which are known as elliptic modular graph forms (eMGFs). We solve the differential equations of eMGFs depending on a single point $z$ and the modular parameter $τ$ via iterated integrals over holomorphic modular forms which individually transform inhomogeneously under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$. Suitable generating series of these iterated integrals over $τ$, their complex conjugates and single-valued multiple zeta values (svMZVs) are combined to attain equivariant transformations under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ such that their components are modular forms. Our generating series of equivariant iterated integrals for eMGFs is related to elliptic multiple polylogarithms (eMPLs) through a gauge transform of the flat Calaque-Enriquez-Etingof connection. By converting iterated $τ$-integrals to iterated integrals over points on a torus, we arrive at an explicit construction of single-valued eMPLs where all the monodromies in the points cancel. Each single-valued eMPL depending on a single point $z$ is found to be a finite combination of meromorphic eMPLs, their complex conjugates, svMZVs and equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals. Our generating series determines the latter two admixtures via so-called zeta generators and Tsunogai derivations which act on the two generators $x$, $y$ of a free Lie algebra and where the coefficients of words in $x,y$ define the single-valued eMPLs.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 72pp

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A_q$ be the alternating central extension of the q-Onsager algebra, a comodule algebra over the quantum loop algebra of $sl_2$. We first classify one-dimensional representations of $A_q$, on which spin-j K-operators constructed in [LBG] act as K-matrices. Using the K-operators and these K-matrices, we construct universal spin-j transfer matrices generating commutative subalgebras in $A_q$. Within a technical conjecture, we derive their fusion hierarchy, the so-called universal TT-relations. On spin-chain representations of $A_q$, we show how the universal transfer matrices evaluate to spin-chain transfer matrices, and as a result we get explicit TT-relations for all values of spins for auxiliary and quantum spaces, any inhomogeneities, and general integrable boundary conditions. In particular, we derive previously conjectured TT-relations. Using the TT-relations, we show that n-th local conserved quantities of the spin-j chains of length N are polynomials of total degree 4Njn in two non-local operators of the q-Onsager algebra. As a result, we give an algorithm of explicit calculation of all conserved quantities (Hamiltonians and higher logarithmic derivatives of the transfer matrix) in terms of spin operators. Furthermore, using the universal TT-relations we derive exchange relations between spin-j Hamiltonians and the two non-local operators, which shows existence of non-trivial symmetries for special boundary conditions, in the sense that they commute with all Hamiltonian densities. As a yet another application of our universal TT-relations we propose universal T-system, Y-system and universal TQ-relations for $A_q$, and as a result, universal TQ for the q-Onsager algebra. In view of application to diagonal boundary conditions, we also obtain universal TT- and TQ-relations for a certain degenerate version of $A_q$ known as centrally extended augmented q-Onsager algebra.</p></details>

As an algebraic analogue of Kochen and Specker's no-hidden-variables result, we investigate rational subrings over which the partial ring of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices ($d \geq 3$) admits no morphism to a commutative ring, which we view as an "algebraic hidden state." For $d = 3$, the minimal such ring is shown to be $\mathbb{Z}[1/6]$, while for $d \geq 6$ the minimal subring is $\mathbb{Z}$ itself. The proofs rely on the construction of new sets of integer vectors in dimensions 3 and 6 that have no Kochen-Specker coloring.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Stable Reduction Theorem guarantees that any smooth, projective, geometrically irreducible curve of genus $g \geq 2$ over a discretely valued field admits a unique stable model after a finite field extension. Computing this model is a central problem in arithmetic geometry. For non-hyperelliptic genus $3$ curves, which are canonically embedded as plane quartics, methods like admissible reduction become challenging in small residue characteristics. This thesis establishes a precise connection between the abstractly defined stable model and computationally accessible GIT-stable plane models. We prove that a GIT-stable plane model of a smooth plane quartic exists if and only if its stable reduction is non-hyperelliptic. When this condition holds, we show that the stable model is the unique minimal semistable model that dominates the GIT-stable model. The corresponding domination morphism is geometrically explicit: it contracts the $1$-tails of the stable reduction to cusps on the special fiber of the GIT-stable model and is an immersion elsewhere. This result provides a geometric framework for computing the stable model by first finding a GIT-stable model and then resolving its cuspidal singularities.</p></details>

This provides the first infinite family of examples where effective equidistribution, with polynomial error rate, of non-horospherical unipotent subgroups in semisimple quotients is obtained. As applications, we obtain effective estimate on distribution of lattice orbits on homogeneous spaces, as well as an effective version of the Oppenheim conjecture for indefinite quadratic forms with a polynomial error rate in all dimension $d \geq 3$. We also prove a sub-modularity inequality for irreducible representation of connected algebraic group, which is crucial to our proof and is of independent interest.</p></details>

We show that the coinvariant space of the multiplicative action affords the regular representation and is isomorphic to a space of multiplicative harmonics, which corresponds to existing results for additive coinvariants of reflection groups. We then design an algorithm to compute a multiplicative coinvariant basis from an additive one. The algorithm preserves isotypic decomposition and graded structure and enables the study of multiplicative coinvariants by integrating combinatorial knowledge from the additive setting. We investigate the Weyl groups of type A and C to find new explicit equivariant maps and combinatorial structure.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A classical observation in analysis asserts that lacunary systems of dilated functions show many properties which are also typical for systems of independent random variables. For example, if $(n_k)_{k \ge 1}$ is a sequence of integers satisfying the Hadamard gap condition $n_{k+1}/n_k\ge q > 1,~k \ge 1$, then the normalized sums $\sum_{n=1}^N \cos(2πn_k x)$, considered on the probability space $[0,1]$ with Borel $σ$-field and Lebesgue measure, satisfy the central limit theorem (CLT) and the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL). Remarkably, the situation becomes much more deliacate when the trigonometric function $\cos(2 πx)$ is replaced by a more general 1-periodic function $f$, and fine arithmetic properties of the sequence $(n_k)_{k \ge 1}$ come into play. The most relevant arithmetic property can be phrased in terms of the number of solutions of certain 2-variable Diophantine equations. Recently, the authors proved that the validity of the LIL requires a strictly stronger Diophantine criterion than the CLT. In the present paper we show that this is only a special case of a wide-ranging general principle: there is a sharp cutoff, which can be expressed in form of a Diophantine criterion on the sequence $(n_k)_{k \ge 1}$, at which the tail probabilities of $\sum_{k=1}^N f(n_k x)$ change from Gaussian to potentially erratic behavior. More precisely, let $L(N,a,b,c)$ be the number of solutions $(k,\ell)$ of the equation $a n_k - b n_\ell= c$, where $1\leq k,\ell \leq N$. Roughly speaking, we prove: if $L(N,a,b,c) \le N / g_N$ for some $g_N$, then $\mathbb{P} \left[\sum_{k=1}^N f(n_k x) > t \|f\|_2 \sqrt{N} \right]$ is asymptotically is accordance with standard normal behavior for all $t$ up to $\sqrt{2 \log g_N}$. We also show that this criterion is optimal in the sense that under the same premises, the conclusion can fail to be true for values of $t$ beyond this threshold.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Walled Brauer algebras $B_N ( m , n ) $ illuminate the combinatorics of mixed tensor representations of $U(N)$, with $m$ copies of the fundamental and $n$ copies of the anti-fundamental representation. They lie at the intersection of research in representation theory, AdS/CFT and quantum information theory. They have been used to study of correlators in multi-matrix models motivated by brane-anti-brane physics in AdS/CFT. They have been applied in computing and optimising fidelities of port-based quantum teleportation. There is a large $N$ regime, specifically $ N \ge (m+n)$ where the algebras are semi-simple and their representation theory more tractable. There are known combinatorial formulae for dimensions of irreducible representations and associated reduction multiplicities. The large $N$ regime has a stability property whereby these formulae are independent of $N$. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the combinatorics in the non-semisimple regime of $ N = m +n - l $, with positive $l$. We introduce restricted Bratteli diagrams (RBD) which are useful as an instrument to process known data from the large $N$ regime to calculate representation theory data in the non-semisimple regime. We identify within the non-semisimple regime, a region of $(m,n)$-stability, where $ \min ( m, n ) \ge ( 2l -3) $ and the RBD take a stable form depending on $l$ only and not the choice of $ m,n$ within the region. In this regime, several aspects of the combinatorics of the RBD are controlled by a universal partition function for an infinite tower of simple harmonic oscillators closely related, but not identical, to the partition function of 2D non-chiral free scalar field theory.</p></details>

In this article, we revisit Schultz's identity and present two distinct approaches to its derivation. Our investigation not only provides new proofs but also yields several identities of a similar type.

We aim for a self-contained treatment, not relying on previous work on algebraic or analytic motives. Applying the theory to discrete fields, one still recovers the etale version of Voevodsky's theory. Two notable features of our setting which do not hold in other settings are that over any base, the cancellation theorem holds true, and under only minor assumptions on the base, the stable $\infty$-category of motivic sheaves is rigid dualizable.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe a curious structure of the special orthogonal, special unitary, and symplectic groups that has not been observed, namely, they can be expressed as matrix products of their corresponding Grassmannians realized as involution matrices. We will show that $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ is a product of two real Grassmannians, $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ a product of four complex Grassmannians, and $\mathrm{Sp}(2n, \mathbb{R})$ or $\mathrm{Sp}(2n, \mathbb{C})$ a product of four symplectic Grassmannians over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ respectively.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $H_n(\boldsymbol{u})$ be the degenerate cyclotomic Hecke algebra with parameter $\boldsymbol{u}=(u_1, \ldots, u_m)$ over $\mathbb{C}(\boldsymbol{u})$. We define and construct the (non-)normalized Markov traces on the sequence $\{H_n(\boldsymbol{u})\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$. This allows us to provide a canonical symmetrizing form on $H_n(\boldsymbol{u})$ and show that the Brudan--Kleshchev trace on $H_n(\boldsymbol{u})$ is a specialization of the non-normalized Markov traces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We fill the gaps in A. Gica's determination of all the odd positive integers $d$ for which the number of distinct prime divisors of $f_d(x)=d+x^2$ is less than or equal to $2$ for all the positive and odd integers $x\leq\sqrt{d}$. We also determine all the even positive integers $d$ for which the number of distinct prime divisors of $f_d(x)$ is less than or equal to $2$ for all the positive and even integers $x\leq\sqrt{d}$. These problems are related to the famous Frobenius-Rabinowitsch's characterization of the imaginary quadratic number fields ${\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{-d})$ of odd discriminants with class number one in terms of the primality of $f_d(x)/4$ for all the positive and odd integers $x\leq\sqrt{d}$. However, the solution to our problem is much more difficult to come up with. We also begin to address the same problems for the case of $f_d(x)=d-x^2$, in relation with the class groups of the real quadratic number fields ${\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{d})$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a general construction of single-valued elliptic polylogarithms as functions on the once-punctured elliptic curve. Our formalism is an extension of Brown's construction of genus-zero single-valued polylogarithms to the elliptic curve: the condition of trivial monodromy for solutions to the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equation is expressed in terms of elliptic associators and involves two representations of a two-letter alphabet. Our elliptic single-valued condition reduces to Brown's genus-zero condition upon degeneration of the torus. We provide several examples for our construction, including the elliptic Bloch-Wigner dilogarithm.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given an positive integer $k$, let $n:=\binom{k+1}{2}$. In 2012, during a talk at UCLA, Jan Saxl conjectured that all irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ occur in the decomposition of the tensor square of the irreducible representation corresponding to the staircase partition. In this paper, we investigate two useful methods to obtain some irreducible representations that occur in this decomposition. Our main tolls are the semi-group property for Kronecker coefficients and generalized blocks of symmetric groups.</p></details>

This result is obtained by using the computation of the monodromy group and the irreducibility for the closure of the non-ordinary Newton stratum in the special fiber of the Picard modular surface at a split prime.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In the function field setting with a fixed characteristic, it was proven by the second and third authors that the values $\log \big|L\big(\frac12, χ_D\big)\big|$ as $D$ varies over monic and square-free polynomials are asymptotically Gaussian distributed on the assumption of a low lying zeros hypothesis as the degree of $D$ tends to $\infty$. For real distinct shifts $t_j$ all of microscopic size or all of nonmicroscopic size relative to the genus, we consider linear combinations of $\log\big|L\big(\frac12+it_j, χ_D\big)\big|$ with real coefficients, and separately, of $\arg L\big(\frac12+it_j, χ_D\big).$ We provide estimates for their distribution functions under the low lying zeros hypothesis. We similarly study distribution functions of linear combinations of $\log\big|L\big(\frac12+it_j, E\otimes χ_D\big)\big|$, and separately $\arg L\big(\frac12+it_j, E\otimesχ_D\big)$, for quadratic twists of elliptic curves $E$ with root number one as the conductor gets large. As an application of these results, we prove a central limit theorem for the fluctuation of the number of nontrivial zeros of such $L$-functions from its mean, and thus recover previous results by Faifman and Rudnick. Correlations of such fluctuations are in harmony with the results of Bourgade, Coram and Diaconis, and Wieand for zeros of the Riemann zeta function and for eigenangles of unitary random matrices.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 37 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Sawin recently gave an axiomatic characterization of multiple Dirichlet series over the function field $\mathbb{F}_{q}(T)$ and proved their existence by exhibiting the coefficients as trace functions of specific perverse sheaves. However, he did not prove that these series actually converge anywhere, instead treating them as formal power series. In this paper, we prove that these series do converge in a certain region, and moreover that the functions obtained by analytically continuing them satisfy functional equations. For convergence, it suffices to obtain bounds on the coefficients, for which we use the decomposition theorem for perverse sheaves, in combination with the Kontsevich moduli space of stable maps to construct a suitable compactification. For the functional equations, the key identity is a multi-variable generalization of the relationship between a Dirichlet character and its Fourier transform; in the multiple Dirichlet series setting, this uses a density trick for simple perverse sheaves and an explicit formula for intermediate extensions from the complement of a normal crossings divisor.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Browning and Vishe used the Hardy-Littlewood circle method to show the moduli space of rational curves on smooth hypersurfaces of low degree is irreducible and of the expected dimension. We reinterpret the circle method geometrically and prove a generalization for higher genus smooth projective curves. In particular, we explain how the geometry of numbers can be understood via the Beauville-Laszlo theorem in terms of vector bundles on curves and their slopes, allowing us to prove a higher genus variant of Davenport's shrinking lemma. As a corollary, we apply this result to show the Fujita invariant of any proper subvariety of a smooth hypersurface of low degree is less than 1.</p></details>
