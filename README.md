 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Takashi Hirotsu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we generalize the following problem, which is called the rational angle bisection problem, to the $n$-dimensional space $k^n$ over a subfield $k$ of $\mathbb R$: on the coordinate plane, for which rational numbers $a$ and $b$ are the slopes of the angle bisectors between two lines with slopes $a$ and $b$ rational? First, we give a few characterizations of when the angle bisectors between two lines with direction vectors in $k^n$ have direction vectors in $k^n.$ To find solutions to the problem in the case when $k = \mathbb Q,$ we also give a formula for the integral solutions of $x_1{}^2+\dots +x_n{}^2 = dx_{n+1}{}^2,$ which is a generalization of the negative Pell's equation $x^2-dy^2 = -1,$ where $d$ is a square-free positive integer. Second, by applying the above characterizations, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the incenter of a given $n$-simplex with $k$-rational vertices to be $k$-rational. On the coordinate plane, we prove that every triangle with $k$-rational vertices and incenter can be obtained by scaling a triangle with $k$-rational side lengths and area, which is a generalization of a Heronian triangle. We also state certain fundamental properties of a few centers of a given triangle with $k$-rational vertices.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** J. E. Cremona, P. Koymans &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the problem of covering $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with a finite number of sublattices of finite index, satisfying a simple minimality or non-degeneracy condition. We show how this problem may be viewed as a projective (or homogeneous) version of the well-known problem of covering systems of congruences. We give a construction of minimal coverings which produces many, but not all, minimal coverings, and determine all minimal coverings with at most $8$ sublattices.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Wooyeon Kim, Jens Marklof, Matthew Welsh &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Berry and Tabor conjectured in 1977 that spectra of generic integrable quantum systems have the same local statistics as a Poisson point process. We verify their conjecture in the case of the two-point spectral density for a quantum particle in a three-dimensional box, subject to a Diophantine condition on the domain's proportions. A permissible choice of width, height and depth is for example $1,2^{1/3},2^{-1/3}$. This extends previous work of Eskin, Margulis and Mozes (Annals of Math., 2005) in dimension two, where the problem reduces to the quantitative Oppenheim conjecture for quadratic forms of signature $(2,2)$. The difficulty in three and higher dimensions is that we need to consider the distribution of indefinite forms in shrinking rather than fixed intervals, which we are able to resolve for special diagonal forms of signature $(3,3)$ in various scalings, including a rate of convergence. A key step of our approach is to represent the relevant counting problem as an average of a theta function on $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})^3\backslash\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})^3$ over an expanding family of one-parameter unipotent orbits. The asymptotic behaviour of these unipotent averages follows from Ratner's measure classification theorem and subtle escape of mass estimates.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ be subcategories of tensor categories $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$, respectively, both of which are abelian categories with finitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects. We prove that if their derived categories $\mathbf{D}^b(\mathcal{A})$ and $\mathbf{D}^b(\mathcal{B})$ are left triangulated tensor ideals and are equivalent as triangulated $\mathbf{D}^b(\mathcal{C})$-module categories via an equivalence induced by a monoidal triangulated functor $F:\mathbf{D}^b(\mathcal{C})\rightarrow \mathbf{D}^b(\mathcal{D})$, then the original module categories $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are themselves equivalent. We then apply this result to smash product algebras. Furthermore, the localization theory of module categories and triangulated module categories is investigated.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2026-01-06 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Michael R. Powers &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $γ=0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $δ=0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $γ+δ/e=\mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $γ^{(n)}+δ^{(n)}/e=η^{(n)}$, $n\ge0$ for sequences of constants $γ^{(n)}$, $δ^{(n)}$, and $η^{(n)}$ (given respectively by raw, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). Investigating the $γ^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations (where $γ^{(0)}=1$ and $γ^{(1)}=γ$), we find that at least one of the pair {$γ,γ^{(2)}$} and -- conditional on a realistic conjecture verified for $2\leq n\leq26$ -- at least two of each set {$γ,γ^{(n)},γ^{(n+1)},\ldots,γ^{(2n)}$} are transcendental, implying that the $γ^{(n)}$ are transcendental infinitely often (with analogous results for the sequence $Γ^{(n)}(1)=\left(-1\right)^{n}γ^{\left(n\right)}$). We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $η^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent, and therefore transcendental, for all $n\ge0$, implying that at least one of each pair, {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e$} and {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$γ^{(n)},δ^{(n)}/e,δ^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n\ge1$. Further analysis of the $γ^{(n)}$ and $η^{(n)}$ reveals that the values $δ^{(n)}/e$ are transcendental infinitely often with positive asymptotic density. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tildeδ^{(n)}$ and $\tildeη^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $γ^{(n)}+\tildeδ^{(n)}/e=\tildeη^{(n)}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For an irreducible non-singular affine $G$-variety $Y$ whose action is $2$-large, we prove that the Hamiltonian reduction $T^*Y/\!\!/\!\!/G$ is a symplectic variety with terminal singularities, isomorphic to the affine closure of $T^*Z_{\text{reg}}$ for $Z:=Y/\!/G$. As applications, we provide a short proof of G. Schwarz's theorem on the graded surjectivity of the push-forward map $\mathcal{D}(Y)^G\rightarrow \mathcal{D}(Z)$, and we establish the surjectivity of the symbol map on $Z$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a real reductive Lie group and $H$ a reductive subgroup of $G$. Benoist-Kobayashi studied when $L^2(G/H)$ is a tempered representation of $G$. They introduced the functions $ρ$ on Lie algebras and gave a necessary and sufficient condition for the temperedness of $L^2(G/H)$ in terms of an inequality on $ρ$. In a joint work with Y. Oshima, we considered when $L^2(G/H)$ is equivalent to a unitary subrepresentation of $L^2(G)$ and gave a sufficient condition for this in terms of a strict inequality of $ρ$. In this paper, we will classify the pairs $(\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{h})$ with $\mathfrak{g}$ complex reductive and $\mathfrak{h}$ complex semisimple which satisfy that strict inequality of $ρ$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $G$ be a real reductive Lie group and $H$ a reductive subgroup of $G$. Benoist-Kobayashi studied when $L^2(G/H)$ is a tempered representation of $G$ and in particular they gave a necessary and sufficient condition for the temperedness in terms of certain functions on Lie algebras. In this paper, we consider when $L^2(G/H)$ is equivalent to a unitary subrepresentation of $L^2(G)$ and we will give a sufficient condition for this in terms of functions introduced by Benoist-Kobayashi. As a corollary, we prove the non-existence of discrete series for homogeneous spaces $G/H$ satisfying certain conditions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A,B\subseteq\mathbb Z_n$ be given and $S=(x_1,\ldots, x_k)$ be a sequence in $\mathbb Z_n$. We say that $S$ is an $(A,B)$-weighted zero-sum sequence if there exist $a_1,\ldots,a_k\in A$ and $b_1,\ldots,b_k\in B$ such that $a_1x_1+\cdots+a_kx_k=0$ and $b_1a_1+\cdots+b_ka_k=0$. We show that if $S$ has length $2n-1$, then $S$ has an $(A,B)$-weighted zero-sum subsequence of length $n$. The constant $E_{A,B}$ is defined to be the smallest positive integer $k$ such that every sequence of length $k$ in $\mathbb Z_n$ has an $(A,B)$-weighted zero-sum subsequence of length $n$. A sequence in $\mathbb Z_n$ of length $E_{A,B}-1$ which does not have any $(A,B)$-weighted zero-sum subsequence of length $n$ is called an $E$-extremal sequence for $(A,B)$. We determine the constant $E_{A,B}$ and characterize the $E$-extremal sequences for some pairs $(A,B)$. We also study the related constants $C_{A,B}$ and $D_{A,B}$ which are defined in the article.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages. Significant changes. New section and new results added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A natural generating set for a Galois extension regarded as the splitting field of an irreducible polynomial is introduced and investigated here. Minimal generating sets arising in this context throw many surprises compared to the analogous concept in linear algebra: they can be of different cardinalities. In fact we establish that for a certain family of polynomials over the rationals, we have minimal generating sets of all cardinalities in a certain range and that these are the only possible cardinalities for minimal generating set for such a polynomial. We also study how minimal generating sets behave under multiple transitivity of the Galois group and consequently prove the existence of polynomials with all minimal generating sets of uniformly same cardinality. We also connect minimal generating sets with the concept of root cluster tower of an irreducible polynomial introduced by the second author and Krithika in [8].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 1934, Ramaswami proved a number of curious translation formulae satisfied by the Riemann zeta function. Such translation formulae, in turn give the meromorphic extension of the Riemann zeta function. In 1954, Apostol extended those identities to establish a family of such similar translation formulae. In this article, we establish many such Ramaswami and Apostol type translation formulae for the Dirichlet series defining the polylogarithm functions. This extended set up has many interesting applications, for example, it allows us to also find some (seemingly new) recurrence relations between the Bernoulli numbers, and use them to deduce some congruence properties of the tangent numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any compactly generated triangulated category we introduce two topological spaces, the shift-spectrum and the shift-homological spectrum. We use them to parametrise a family of thick subcategories of the compact objects, which we call radical. These spaces can be viewed as non-monoidal analogues of the Balmer and homological spectra arising in tensor-triangular geometry: we prove that for monogenic tensor-triangulated categories the Balmer spectrum is a subspace of the shift-spectrum. To construct these analogues we utilise quotients of the module category, rather than the lattice theoretic methods which have been adopted in other approaches. We characterise radical thick subcategories and show in certain cases, such as the perfect derived categories of tame hereditary algebras or monogenic tensor-triangulated categories, that every thick subcategory is radical. We establish a close relationship between the shift-homological spectrum and the set of irreducible integral rank functions, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for every radical thick subcategory to be given by an intersection of kernels of rank functions. In order to facilitate these results, we prove that both spaces we introduce may equivalently be described in terms of the Ziegler spectrum.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the differential and boomerang properties of a class of binomial $F_{r,u}(x) = x^r(1 + uχ(x))$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, where $r = \frac{p^n+1}{4}$, $p^n \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$, and $χ(x) = x^{\frac{p^n -1}{2}}$ is the quadratic character in $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$. We show that $F_{r,\pm1}$ is locally-PN with boomerang uniformity $0$ when $p^n \equiv 3 \pmod{8}$. To the best of our knowledge, it is the second known non-PN function class with boomerang uniformity $0$, and the first such example over odd characteristic fields with $p > 3$. Moreover, we show that $F_{r,\pm1}$ is locally-APN with boomerang uniformity at most $2$ when $p^n \equiv 7 \pmod{8}$. We also provide complete classifications of the differential and boomerang spectra of $F_{r,\pm1}$. Furthermore, we thoroughly investigate the differential uniformity of $F_{r,u}$ for $u\in \mathbb{F}_{p^n}^* \setminus \{\pm1\}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Previous research on exceptional units has primarily focused on the ring of rational integers or abstract finite rings, often restricted to linear or quadratic constraints. In this paper, we extend the concept of polynomial-type exceptional units to the ring of integers of an arbitrary algebraic number field. We investigate the number of these polynomial-type exceptional units on general algebraic varieties. By employing the Chinese Remainder Theorem and Hensel's lifting technique, we derive an exact counting formula for the number of these exceptional units on a smooth closed subscheme under the assumption of good reduction. Furthermore, using the Lang-Weil inequality, we establish an asymptotic estimate for the counting function. In particular, we prove that for varieties of degree at most two, the error term can be significantly improved, yielding a sharper asymptotic bound.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 25 pages, 2 figures; Section 8 is updated

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The action of the cactus group $C_n$ on Young tableaux of a given shape $λ$ goes back to Berenstein and Kirillov and arises naturally in the study of crystal bases and quantum integrable systems. We show that this action is $2$-transitive on standard Young tableaux of the shape $λ$ if and only if $λ$ is not self-transpose and not a single hook. Moreover, we show that in these cases, the image of the cactus group in the permutation group of standard Young tableaux is either the whole permutation group or the alternating group, and prove that both cases are possible for infinitely many $λ$ (though the alternating group is more frequent). As an application, this implies that the Galois group of solutions to the Bethe ansatz in the Gaudin model attached to the Lie group $GL_d$ is, in many cases, at least the alternating group. This also extends the results of Sottile and White on the multiple transitivity of the Galois group of Schubert calculus problems in Grassmannians to many new cases.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Symmetric quiver varieties with potentials are natural generalizations of Nakajima quiver varieties, and their equivariant critical cohomologies provide more flexible settings for geometric representation theory and enumerative geometry. In this paper, we study their geometric properties and show that they behave like universally deformed Nakajima quiver varieties. Based on this, we provide a new proof of the existence of critical stable envelopes on them. Following an idea of Nakajima, we give a sheaf theoretic interpretation of critical stable envelopes by the hyperbolic restriction in the affinization of symmetric quiver varieties. The associativity of hyperbolic restrictions implies the triangle lemma of critical stable envelopes.</p></details>

A diagonal similarity reduces $V_n(b)$ to a symmetric tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix and hence makes its spectrum explicit. Since $\det\left(V_n(b)\right)$ equals the geometric sum $1+b+\cdots+b^{n}$, taking determinants yields a finite cosine product evaluation for this quantity. As further consequences, we derive sharp bounds from the extremal eigenvalues, write down explicit eigenvectors with respect to a natural weighted inner product, and obtain a closed formula for $V_n(b)^{-1}$.</p></details>

It generalizes orbit mutations arising from quiver coverings and allows for infinite mutation sequences even when orbit mutations are obstructed.

> **Comment:** Minor corrections. An error in the proof of Proposition 8.26 was fixed

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop the theory of "virtual morphisms" in logarithmic algebraic geometry, introduced by Howell. It allows one to give algebro-geometric meaning to various useful maps of topological spaces that do not correspond to morphisms of (log) schemes in the classical sense, while retaining functoriality of key constructions. In particular, we explain how virtual morphisms provide a natural categorical home for Deligne's theory of tangential basepoints: the latter are simply the virtual morphisms from a point. We also extend Howell's results on the functoriality of Betti and de Rham cohomology. Using this framework, we lift the topological operad of little $2$-disks to an operad in log schemes over the integers, whose virtual points are isomorphism classes of stable marked curves of genus zero equipped with a tangential basepoint. The gluing of such curves along marked points is performed using virtual morphisms that transport tangential basepoints around the curves. This builds on Vaintrob's analogous construction for framed little disks, for which the classical notion of morphism in logarithmic geometry sufficed. In this way, we obtain a direct algebro-geometric proof of the formality of the little disks operad, following the strategy envisioned by Beilinson. Furthermore, Bar-Natan's parenthesized braids naturally appear as the fundamental groupoids of our moduli spaces, with all virtual basepoints defined over the integers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish improved bounds for bilinear forms with Kloosterman fractions of the form ${\sum\sum}_{m,n} α_m β_n e(a\overline{m}/(bn))$ with $M<m\le 2M$, $N < n \le 2N$ and $(m,n)=1$. Our approach works directly with arbitrary coefficient sequences $(α_m), (β_n) \in \mathbb{C}$, avoiding the temporary restriction to squarefree support used in prior work. While this requires handling additional arithmetic complexity, it yields strictly stronger bounds that improve upon the estimates of Duke, Friedlander, and Iwaniec \cite{DFI} and Bettin-Chandee \cite{BC}; in the balanced case $M \approx N$, the new saving over the trivial bound is $1/12$%, compared to $1/48$ in \cite{DFI} . As an application, we prove a generalized asymptotic formula for the twisted second moment of the Riemann zeta-function with Dirichlet polynomials of length $T^{1/2+δ}$ for $δ= 1/46$, extending beyond the previously limiting $θ= 1/2$ barrier established by Bettin, Chandee, and Radziwiłł \cite{BCR}. We also establish bounds for related Hermitian sums involving Salié-type exponential phases and develop techniques for more general bilinear forms with Kloosterman fractions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $C\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ be a convex body, and let $\mathcal{P}\subset[0,1)^2$ be a set of $N$ points. The discrepancy of $\mathcal{P}$ with respect to $C$ is defined as \begin{equation*} \mathcal{D}(\mathcal{P},\, C)=\sum_{\mathbf{p}\in\mathcal{P}}\sum_{\mathbf{n}\in\mathbb{Z}^2}\mathds{1}_C(\mathbf{p}+\mathbf{n})-N|C|. \end{equation*} A standard approach for estimating how a point distribution deviates from uniformity is to average the latter quantity over a family of sets; in particular, when considering quadratic averages over translations and dilations, one obtains \begin{equation*} \mathcal{D}_2(\mathcal{P},\, C)=\int_{0}^{1}\int_{[0,1)^2}\left|\mathcal{D}( \mathcal{P},\,\boldsymbolτ+δC)\right|^2\,{\rm d}\boldsymbolτ\,{\rm d} δ. \end{equation*} This paper concerns the behaviour of optimal \textit{homothetic quadratic discrepancy} \begin{equation*} \inf_{\# \mathcal{P}=N} \mathcal{D}_2(\mathcal{P},\, C)\quad\text{as}\quad N\to+\infty. \end{equation*} Beck and Chen \cite{MR1489133} showed that the optimal \textit{h.q.d.} of convex polygons has an order of growth of $\log N$. More recently, Brandolini and Travaglini \cite{MR4358540} showed that the optimal \textit{h.q.d.} of planar convex bodies has an order of growth of $N^{1/2}$ if their boundary is $\mathcal{C}^2$, and of $N^{2/5}$ if their boundary is only piecewise-$\mathcal{C}^2$ and not polygonal. We show that, in general, no order of growth is required. First, by an implicit geometric construction, we show that one can obtain prescribed oscillations from a logarithmic order of $\log N$ to polynomial orders of $N^{2/5}$ and $N^{1/2}$, and vice versa. Secondly, by using Fourier-analytic methods, we show that prescribed polynomial-order oscillations in the range $N^α$ with $α\in(2/5,1/2)$ are achievable.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We extend the classical Burgess estimates to character sums over proper generalized arithmetic progressions (GAPs) of rank $2$ in prime fields $\mathbb{F}_p$. The core of our proof is a sharp upper bound for the multiplicative energy of these sets, established by adapting an argument of Konyagin and leveraging tools from the geometry of numbers. A key step in our argument involves establishing new upper bounds for the sizes of Bohr sets, which may be of independent interest.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Based on the pioneering ideas of Kashaev [Kas98,Kas00], we present a fully explicit construction of a finite-dimensional projective representation of the dotted Ptolemy groupoid when the quantum parameter $q$ is a root of unity, which reproduces the central charge of the $SU(2)$ Wess--Zumino--Witten model. A basic ingredient is the cyclic quantum dilogarithm [FK94]. A notable contribution of this work is a reinterpretation of the relations among the parameters in the cyclic quantum dilogarithm to ensure its pentagon identity in terms of the mutations of coefficients. In particular, we find the dual roles of these parameters: as coefficients in quantum cluster algebras and as the central characters of quantum cluster variables. We also provide a geometric method to decompose the space of quantum states into irreducible modules of the Chekhov--Fock algebra. We introduce two versions of quantum intertwiners associated with a mapping class: on the entire representation space and on each irreducible component, each being an explicit composite of cyclic quantum dilogarithm operators. We prove that the former gives an intertwiner of local representations of quantum Teichmüller space in the sense of Bai--Bonahon--Liu [BBL07], and also coincides with the transpose of the reduced quantum hyperbolic operator of Baseilhac--Benedetti [BB18]. The mutation relation of coefficients is equivalent to the quantum gluing equation. The irreducible intertwiner conjecturally coincides with the Bonahon--Liu intertwiner [BL07], and we give a partial evidence.</p></details>

Next, we give various constructions of modified Rota-Baxter operators of non-zero weight according to constructions of $3$-Lie algebras. Furthermore, we define a cohomology of modified Rota-Baxter operators of non-zero weight on $3$-Lie algebras with coefficients in a suitable representation. As an application, we study formal deformations of modified Rota-Baxter operators of non-zero weight that are generated by the above-defined cohomology. In the final part of the paper, we construct two \(L_\infty[1]\)-algebra structures whose Maurer-Cartan elements correspond to relative and absolute modified Rota-Baxter \(3\)-Lie algebra structures of nonzero weight, respectively. Lastly, we compare our \(L_\infty[1]\)-algebraic approach with the deformation-controlling \(L_\infty[1]\)-algebra for relative Rota-Baxter \(3\)-Lie operators developed by Hou, Sheng, and Zhou.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We completely classify Laurent series converging on the unit circle over a non-Archimedean local field (of any characteristic) that map infinitely many roots of unity to roots of unity. For a given Laurent series $f$ over a field of positive characteristic with residue field $\mathbb{F}_q$, we prove effective bounds for the number of possible roots of unity in terms of the number of zeroes of the auxilliary function $f(x^q)-f(x)^q$ on the unit circle. In characteristic $0$ our bound is still effective but also depends on the ramification degree of the base field over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ as well as the size of the coefficients of $f$. This has applications to the Manin-Mumford conjecture in $\mathbb{G}_m^2$. In characteristic $0$, this work builds upon a pigeon-hole based method by Schmidt.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a problem with three equivalent formulations: describing Gibbs measures for five-vertex model in quadrant; classifying coherent systems on a p-deformation of the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph related to Grothendieck polynomials; finding the Martin boundary for discrete time TASEP with p-geometric jumps. We find a wide family of the Gibbs measures, parameterized by certain analytic functions. A subset of our measures have probabilistic interpretation as interacting particle systems with fixed particles speeds. In contrast to previous related boundary problems, we find that admissible speeds are not arbitrary, but must be larger than $\frac{p}{1-p}$. For this subset we further establish Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem, connecting the fluctuations to families of independent GUE eigenvalues. As a consequence, the measures from the subset are extreme points of the Martin boundary. It remains open whether our list of measures is exhaustive.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we introduce the algebraic definitions and presentations of the virtual singular twin monoid and virtual singular twin group, denoted by $VSTM_n$ and $VST_n$, respectively, for a positive integer $n$. These structures extend the twin group $T_n$ in close analogy to how the virtual singular braid monoid and virtual singular braid group extend the classical braid group. We then construct and study representations of the group $VST_n$, for $n \geq 3$, focusing in particular on extending the representations $η_1$ and $η_2$ of $T_n$, introduced by M. Nasser, to $VST_n$ via the $2$-local extension method. To analyze the resulting representations, $η_1'$ and $η_2'$, and their properties, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for irreducibility and show that both $η_1'$ and $η_2'$ are unfaithful. Additionally, we classify all complex homogeneous $2$-local representations of $VST_n$ for every integer $n\geq 3$, providing a foundation for further investigation into representations of $VST_n$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the following problem: what is the smallest possible distance between a cubic irrational $ξ$ and a rational number $p/q$ in terms of the height $H(ξ)$ and $q$? More precisely, we consider the set $D_{3,1}$ consisting of all pairs $(u,v)$ of positive real numbers such that $|ξ- p/q| > cH^{-u}(ξ)q^{-v}$ for all cubic irrationals $ξ$ and rationals $p/q$. First, we transform this problem into one about the root separation of cubic polynomials. Second, under the assumption of the famous abc-conjecture, we give an almost complete description of $D_{3,1}$. Namely, the points $(u,v)$ with $2\le v\le 3$ that lie in the interior of $D_{3,1}$ are characterised by the inequality $u> 10-3v$. Assuming only the weaker Hall conjecture, we also obtain nontrivial results about the shape of $D_{3,1}$, although these are not as strong as those derived from the abc-conjecture. Finally, we discuss an analogue of the set $D_{3,1}$ in function fields where we are able to give an almost complete description unconditionally.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we develop a quantitative inverse theory for the Gowers uniformity norm $\|\cdot\|_{\mathsf{U}^4}$ in general finite abelian groups. We identify a new type of obstructions to uniformity, which we call almost-cubic polynomials. An almost-cubic polynomial $q$ on a Bohr set $B(Γ, ρ_0)$ is a function such that, for each $ρ\leq \min\{ρ_0, 1/8\}$, we have $$\|Δ_{a,b,c,d} q(x)\|_{\mathbb{T}} \leq 2^{10} ρ$$ for all $x, a,b,c,d \in B(Γ, ρ)$. Let $f : G \to \mathbb{D}$ be a function with $\|f\|_{\mathsf{U}^4} \geq c$. We prove quasipolynomial inverse theorems: $\bullet$ when $(|G|, 6) = 1$, there exists an almost-cubic $q : B(Γ, ρ)$ for $|Γ| \leq \log^{O(1)} c^{-1}$ and $ρ\geq \exp(-\log^{O(1)} c^{-1})$, and an element $t \in G$ such that $$\Big|\sum_{x \in G} 1_{B}(x) f(x + t) \mathrm{e}(q(x))\Big| \geq \exp(-\log^{O(1)} c^{-1})|G|,$$ $\bullet$ when $G = (\mathbb{Z}/2^d\mathbb{Z})^n$, there exists a cubic polynomial $q : G \to \mathbb{T}$ such that $$\Big|\sum_{x \in G} f(x)\mathrm{e}(q(x))\Big| \geq \exp(-\log^{O_d(1)} c^{-1})|G|.$$ Almost-cubic polynomials are rather rigid and we exhibit a strong connection with generalized polynomials in the case of cyclic groups, as well as with polynomials in the classical sense in the case of finite vector spaces. We also answer a question of Jamneshan, Shalom and Tao concerning the inverse theory in groups of bounded torsion. The central result from which the inverse theorems follow is a structural result for Freiman bihomomorphisms in general finite abelian groups. In our proof, we generalize methods of our previous work in the case of finite vector spaces and introduce novel ideas concerning extensions of Freiman bihomomorphisms. In the problem of extension of Freiman bihomomorphisms, genuinely new phenomena appear in general finite abelian groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In $2003$, Pei and Wang introduced higher level analogs of the classical Cohen--Eisenstein series. In recent joint work with Beckwith, we found a weight $\frac{1}{2}$ sesquiharmonic preimage of their weight $\frac{3}{2}$ Eisenstein series under $ξ_{\frac{1}{2}}$ utilizing a construction from seminal work by Duke, Imamoglu and Tóth. In further joint work with Beckwith, when restricting to prime level, we realized our preimage as a regularized Siegel theta lift and evaluated its (regularized) Fourier coefficients explicitly. This relied crucially on work by Bruinier, Funke and Imamoglu. In this paper, we extend both works to higher weights. That is, we provide a harmonic preimage of Pei and Wang's generalized Cohen--Eisenstein series under $ξ_{\frac{3}{2}-k}$, where $k > 1$. Furthermore, when restricting to prime level, we realize them as outputs of a regularized Shintani theta lift of a higher level holomorphic Eisenstein series, which builds on recent work by Alfes and Schwagenscheidt. Lastly, we evaluate the regularized Millson theta lift of a higher level Maass--Eisenstein series, which is known to be connected to the Shintani theta lift by a differential equation by earlier work of Alfes and Schwagenscheidt.</p></details>

> **Comment:** This paper has been significantly revised for the second time. An analytic pathology is resolved

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>By applying the inverse Mellin transform to some simple closed form identities, a number of relationships are established that connect integrals containing Riemann's and Hurwitz' zeta functions ($ζ(s)$ and $ζ(s,a)$) and their alternating equivalents $η(s)$ and $η(s,a)$. In particular, special cases involving improper integrals containing $ζ(σ+it)$ and few other functions in the integrand are identified. Many of these integrals that do not appear in the literature, can be, and were, verified numerically. In one limit, the use of analytic continuation generates a family of improper integrals containing only the real and imaginary parts of $ζ(σ+it)$ with and without simple trigonometric factors; the associated closed form contains an (unclassified) entity that has many of the attributes of an essential singularity. Consequently, this means that the associated integrals are indeterminate (i.e. non-single valued), so a new symbol is introduced to label the indeterminism. Much of this paper examines this singularity from several angles in order to resolve the associated ambiguities, before eventually showing how it blends into the classical study of functions of real and complex variables in an unusual manner. This is done by establishing a self-consistent way to remove the singularity and thereby evaluate new members of a family of integrals of general interest that contain $ζ(s,a)$ and $η(s,a)$. Some implications are proposed.</p></details>

We give a new characterization of all endosplit $p$-permutation resolutions and reduce the question of Galois descent of an endosplit $p$-permutation resolution to the Galois descent of the module it resolves. This is shown using techniques from the study of endotrivial complexes, the invertible objects of the bounded homotopy category of $p$-permutation modules. As an application, we show that a refinement of Broué's conjecture proposed by Kessar--Linckelmann holds for certain blocks of groups $G$ satisfying $G = O_{p',p,p'}(G)$ with abelian Sylow $p$-subgroup, the key reduction step in Harris--Linckelmann's verification of Broué's conjecture for all $p$-solvable groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper presents a comprehensive study of matrix Kloosterman sums, including their computational aspects, distributional behavior, and applications in cryptographic analysis. Building on the work of [Zelingher, 2023], we develop algorithms for evaluating these sums via Green's polynomials and establish a general framework for analyzing their statistical distributions. We further investigate the associated $L$-functions and clarify their relationships with symmetric functions and random matrix theory. We show that, analogous to the eigenvalue statistics of random matrices in compact Lie groups such as $SU(n)$ and $Sp(2n)$, the normalized values of matrix Kloosterman sums exhibit Sato-Tate equidistribution. Finally, we apply this framework to distinguish truly random sequences from those exhibiting subtle algebraic biases, and we propose a novel spectral test for cryptographic security based on the distributional signatures of matrix Kloosterman sums.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This series of papers is a contribution to the program of classifying $p$-blocks of finite groups up to source algebra equivalence, starting with the case of cyclic blocks. To any $p$-block $\mathbf{B}$ of a finite group with cyclic defect group $D$, Linckelmann associated an invariant $W( \mathbf{B} )$, which is an indecomposable endo-permutation module over $D$, and which, together with the Brauer tree of~$\mathbf{B} $, essentially determines its source algebra equivalence class. In Part II of our series, assuming that $p$ is an odd prime, we reduced the classification of the invariants $W( \mathbf{B} )$ arising from cyclic $p$-blocks $\mathbf{B}$ of quasisimple classical groups to the classification for cyclic $p$-blocks of quasisimple quotients of special linear or unitary groups. This objective is achieved in the present Part III.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a symmetric quiver with potential, we develop a geometric construction of shifted Yangians acting on the critical cohomologies of antidominantly framed quiver varieties with extended potentials, using the $R$-matrices constructed from critical stable envelopes. We relate such Reshetikhin type Yangians to Drinfeld type Yangians arising from critical cohomological Hall algebras. Several detailed examples, including the trivial, Jordan, and tripled Jordan quivers are explicitly computed. For symmetric quiver varieties with potentials, by using the smallness property of their affinization maps, we derive explicit formulas for quantum multiplication by divisors in terms of Casimir elements of the associated Lie (super)algebras, extending results from Nakajima quiver varieties to the critical setting. A similar formula in the antidominantly framed case is also obtained, which includes Hilbert schemes of points on $\mathbb C^3$ as examples.</p></details>

In this article, we present the formalization of Harder-Narasimhan theory in the proof assistant Lean 4 with Mathlib. This formalization is based on a recent approach of Harder-Narasimhan theory by Chen and Jeannin, which reinterprets the theory in order-theoretic terms and avoids the classical dependence on algebraic geometry. As an application, we formalize the uniqueness of coprimary filtration of a finitely generated module over a noetherian ring, and the existence of the Jordan-Hölder filtration of a semistable Harder-Narasimhan game.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this follow-up paper, we inspect a surprising relationship between the set of $n$-periodic points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathbb{Z}$ and the coefficient $c$, where $d>2$ is an integer and $n\geq 2$ is any fixed integer. As before, we again wish to study counting problems which are inspired by the exciting advances of Bhargava-Shankar-Tsimerman and their collaborators on $n$-torsion point-counting in arithmetic statistics, and also by Hutz's conjecture along with Panraksa's work on $n$-periodic rational point-counting in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any prime $p\geq 3$ and for any fixed (period) $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$, the average number of distinct $n$-periodic integral points of any $\varphi_{p, c}$ modulo $p$ is unbounded or zero as $c$ tends to infinity. Inspired further by a conjecture of Hutz on any $\varphi_{p-1, c}$ for any prime $p\geq 5$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove that for any fixed (period) $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$, the average number of distinct $n$-periodic integral points of any $\varphi_{p-1, c}$ modulo $p$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$ as $c\to \infty$. Finally, we then apply density, polynomial-counting, number field-counting, and Sato-Tate equidistribution results from arithmetic statistics, and thereby obtaining a stream of counting and statistical results on irreducible polynomials, number fields, and Artin $L$-functions that arise naturally in our polynomial discrete dynamical settings.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite group $G$ and a sufficiently large (but fixed) prime power $q$ coprime to $G$ we obtain asymptotics for the number of regular Galois extensions $L/ \mathbb{F}_q(t)$, with $\mathrm{Gal}(L/\mathbb{F}_q(t)) \cong G$, ramified at a single place of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$, thus making progress on a positive characteristic analog of the Boston--Markin conjecture. We also obtain similar results for other arithmetic functions of the product of places of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ ramified in $L$, and for more general one-variable function fields over $\mathbb{F}_q$ in place of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$. Some of our proofs make crucial use of a series of recent breakthroughs by Landesman--Levy, as well as a new `vanishing of stable homology in a given direction' result for representations of braid groups arising from braided vector spaces. Other inputs include a study of (rings of coinvariants of) braided vector spaces associated to racks with $2$-cocycles, a connection between convolution of arithmetic functions and direct sums of braided vector spaces, and a Goursat lemma for racks.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 24 pages, comments welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the question of finding big Bruhat intervals that are poset hypercubes in the symmetric group $S_n$. Using permutations suggested by AlphaEvolve (an evolutionary coding agent developed by Google DeepMind), we were led to an unusual situation in which the agent produced a pattern which performed well for the $n$ tested, and which we show works well for general $n$. When $n$ is a power of 2 we exhibit a hypercube of dimension $O(n\log n)$, matching the largest possible dimension up to a constant multiple. Furthermore, we give an exact characterization of the vertices of this hypercube: they are precisely the \emph{dyadically well-distributed} permutations -- a simple digitwise property that already appeared in connection with Monte Carlo integration and mathematical finance. The maximal dimension of a Bruhat interval that is an hypercube in $S_n$ gives a lower bound (and possibly is equal to) the maximal possible coefficient of the second-highest degree term in the Kazhdan--Lusztig $R$-polynomial in $S_n$. As a surprising consequence, we obtain a new lower bound of order $n\log n$ for the maximal number of frozen variables appearing in the cluster algebras attached to the open Richardson varieties in $S_n$, and a similar result for moduli spaces of embeddings of Bruhat graphs.</p></details>

In the first part, we show that $\underline{\mathscr{C}}$ can be viewed as an infinite categorical analogue of standardly stratified algebras. Explicitly, we give a parameterization of irreducible representations of $\underline{\mathscr{C}} \text{-}\mathrm{Mod}$, provide several sufficient criteria such that $\underline{\mathscr{C}} \text{-}\mathrm{Mod}$ is equivalent to the Cartesian product of module categories over the ``local" endomorphism algebras of $\underline{\mathscr{C}}$, and describe applications of these results to representation theory of some interesting combinatorial categories including categories of spans and the category of finite dimensional vector spaces over a finite field and linear maps. In the second part, using the technique of Grothendieck bifibrations, we glue a family of complete cotorsion pairs in the module categories of these ``local" endomorphism algebras to a complete cotorsion pair in $\underline{\mathscr{C}} \text{-}\mathrm{Mod}$, and deduce that under certain mild conditions a family of abelian model structures on these ``local" module categories can be glued to an abelian model structure on $\underline{\mathscr{C}} \text{-}\mathrm{Mod}$. As applications, we obtain a few abelian model structures on generalized $k$-linear direct or inverse categories.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We first remind the classical analytical proof of the transcendence of $\mathrm{e}$ due to Hilbert. Then, using formal power series, we give two algebraic semiformal proofs of the same result. The first proof is a specialization of a proof of the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem given by Beukers, Bézivin and Roba [2]. The second proof uses improper integrals of formal power series and is due to this author. At the beginning, we explain what ``semiformal'' means and indicate yet another analytical proof of the transcendence of $\mathrm{e}$. Like the two algebraic proofs, it avoids uncountable sets. It is due to this author in [4].</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a symmetrizable Kac--Moody algebra. We describe {standard graded} $\mathfrak{g}$-modules $V$, which we use to construct a completion $\widehat{V}$ and pro-unipotent group $\widehat{U}$ in $\GL(\widehat{V})$. These standard graded modules include the adjoint module, all integrable modules, Category~$\mathcal{O}$ modules, and opposite Category~$\mathcal{O}$ modules. We prove that the elements of $\widehat{U}$ are pro-summable series, that is, they are projective limits of summable series on quotients $\widehat{V}/\prod_{j=k}^\infty{V}_j$, for each $k>0$. We give an explicit construction of root subalgebras and their completions, corresponding to every root including the imaginary roots. We also construct complete root groups for imaginary roots, whose elements are also pro-summable series acting on $\widehat{V}$. We show that these groups are isomorphic to groups of power series in variables corresponding to basis elements for the imaginary root space.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We summarize known results on how to generate an infinite family of integer sequences from the root lattices of rank 2 Kac--Moody algebras. We compute and tabulate the first twenty entries of a number of these sequences. This provides an overarching framework for a large class of Fibonacci-type integer sequences, evaluations of Chebyshev S and U-polynomials and others.</p></details>
