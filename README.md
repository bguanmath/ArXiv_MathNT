<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $α_1, \cdots, α_d$ be real numbers, and let $S$ be the set of integers $s$ so that $||α_i s||_{\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}}>δ$ for some $i$ and some fixed $δ>0$. We prove $S$ is not \enquote{$2$-large}, i.e. there is a $2$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ that avoids arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions with common differences in $S$.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Samuel Lewis, Pavel Shlykov &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.AG &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 36 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper classifies all 4d Nakajima quiver varieties through a combinatorial approach. For each such variety, we describe the symplectic leaves and minimal degenerations between them. Using the resulting Hasse diagrams and secondary hyperplane arrangements, we fully classify the quiver varieties up to isomorphism, a step in the problem of classifying all 4d conical symplectic singularities and the (2, 2) case of quiver varieties. As an application, we answer in the negative a question posed by Bellamy, Craw, Rayan, Schedler, and Weiss regarding whether the $G_4$ quotient singularity (or its projective crepant resolutions) can be realised as a quiver variety.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that there is a set which is not a set of multiple recurrence despite being a set of recurrence for nil-Bohr sets. This answers Huang, Shao, and Ye's \enquote{higher-order} version of Katznelson's Question on Bohr recurrence and topological recurrence in the negative. Equivalently, we construct a set $S$ so that there is a finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ without three-term arithmetic progressions with common differences in $S$, but so that $S$ lacks the usual polynomial obstacles to arithmetic progressions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 42 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we study the Zariski closure of modular points in the two-dimensional universal deformation space when the residual Galois representation is reducible. Unlike the previous approaches in the residually irreducible case from Gouvêa-Mazur, Böckle and Allen, our method relies on local-global compatibility results, potential pro-modularity arguments and a non-ordinary finiteness result between the local deformation ring at $p$ and the global deformation ring. This allows us to construct sufficiently many non-ordinary regular de Rham points whose modularity is guaranteed by the recent progress on the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture. Also, we will discuss some applications of our main results, including the equidimensionality of certain big Hecke algebras and big $R=\mathbb{T}$ theorems in the residually reducible case.</p></details>

Then based on this refined asymptotic formula, we give the exact thresholds of $n$ for the inequalities derived from the invariants of the quartic binary form, the double Turán inequalities, the Laguerre inequalities and their corresponding companion versions.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Matvey A. Surkov &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let N be the maximal unipotent subgroup in the simple algebraic group of type Φ. It naturally acts on the space dual to the Lie algebra n of N, and this action is called coadjoint. Such orbits play the key role in the orbit method of A.A. Kirillov. In this work, we classify the orbits of this action in the case of Φ = F_4 in terms of supports of canonical forms. This means that we will present a set S of linear forms such that for any coadjoint orbit there exists a unique form from S belonging to that orbit. The set of canonical forms will be explicitly described in terms of supports.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Kiyoshi Sogo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 44 pages, no figures

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Many identities written by $P=S=C$ are obtained, where $P$ infinite products, $S$ infinite series, and $C$ continued fractions. Such equality is called {\it triplicity}, and it can be used to compute the values of infinite series. It is applied even to obtain sums of divergent series. Many examples of such infinite series are shown, including $1-2+2^3-2^6+\cdots$, which is in Entry 7 of Gauss's diary and its value $0.4275251302\cdots$ is here obtained.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Nikita Kalinin, Mikhail Shkolnikov &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math-ph &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this note we discuss the novel approach to define equi-affine invariants starting from tropical geometry, where one averages over the space of tropical structures of fixed co-volume. Applied to the tropical distance series, this gives a family of equi-affine invariant functions associated with convex domains which are expected to satisfy a number of remarkable properties. The present note contains a conjecture about the limit structure of corresponding level sets in the compact case, as well as the proof of an analogue of this conjecture for unbounded domains with two non-parallel asymptotes. In addition, we carry out an explicit computation for the arithmetic mean value at center of the unit disk.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 13 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The modular curve X_0(N) parametrizes elliptic curves together with a cyclic subgroup of order N, and hence cyclic N-isogenies. While explicit moduli descriptions of X_1(N) are well developed, a comparable construction for X_0(N) has remained incomplete. We give a uniform method for constructing explicit generators of C(X_0(N)), extending an approach of Dowd, and use them to obtain a concrete moduli interpretation of cyclic N-isogenies. This yields explicit formulas for sporadic rational points on X_0(N) and the associated isogenies, providing a unified solution to the moduli problem for X_0(N).</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently, Ramos and Whiting showed that any generalized cluster algebra of geometric type is isomorphic to a quotient of a subalgebra of a certain cluster algebra. Based on their idea and method, we show that the same property holds for any generalized cluster algebra with $y$-variables in an arbitrary semifield. We also present the relations between the $C$-matrices, the $G$-matrices, and the $F$-polynomials of a generalized cluster pattern and those of the corresponding composite cluster pattern.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18395v2'>2506.18395</a>\]&nbsp; **The second moment of Ramanujan sums**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Hong Ziwei, Zheng Zhiyong &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study $C(x, y)$, the second moment of Ramanujan sums. Assuming the Riemann Hypothesis(RH), we establish an asymptotic formula for $C(x, y)$ with improved error term. Our analysis applies uniformly to the case where $x$ and $y$ are arbitrary close, and in particular allows for a meaningful conparison with the work of \cite{TH} in case $y=2x^2$, while keeping the computational complexity low. The method relies on the use of smooth cutoff functions, which provide greater flexibility in contour shifting.</p></details>

> **Comment:** v2, 63 pages, this is Part 2 of the longer v1, with Part 1 now a separate article in arXiv:2512.19998

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a prequel we introduced the shifted iYangians ${}^\imath Y_μ$ associated to quasi-split Satake diagrams of type ADE and even spherical coweights $μ$, and constructed the iGKLO representations of ${}^\imath Y_μ$, which factor through truncated shifted iYangians ${}^\imath Y_μ^λ$. In this paper, we show that ${}^\imath Y_μ$ quantizes the involutive fixed point locus ${}^\imath W_μ$ arising from affine Grassmannians of type ADE, and supply strong evidence toward the expectation that ${}^\imath Y_μ^λ$ quantizes a top-dimensional component of the affine Grassmannian islice ${}^\imath\overline{W}_μ^λ$. We identify the islices ${}^\imath\overline{W}_μ^λ$ in type AI with suitable nilpotent Slodowy slices of type BCD, building on the work of Lusztig and Mirković-Vybornov in type A. We propose a framework for producing ortho-symplectic (and hybrid) Coulomb branches from split (and nonsplit) Satake framed double quivers, which are conjectured to relate closely to the islices ${}^\imath\overline{W}_μ^λ$ and the algebras ${}^\imath Y_μ^λ$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 34 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(G_n)_{n\geqslant 0}$ be a linear recurrence sequence defining a numeration system and satisfying mild structural hypotheses. For real-valued G-additive functions (additive in the greedy G-digits), we establish an Erdős-Wintner-type theorem: convergence of two canonical series (a first-moment series and a quadratic digit-energy series) is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a limiting distribution along initial segments of the integers. In that case, the limiting characteristic function admits an explicit infinite-product factorization whose local factors depend only on the underlying digit system. We also indicate conditional extensions of this two-series criterion to Ostrowski numeration systems with bounded partial quotients and to Parry $β$-expansions with Pisot-Vijayaraghavan base $β$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the representations of rational numbers via continued fraction, Egyptian fraction, and Engel fraction expansions. Given $m \in \mathbb{N}$, denote by $C_m, E_m, E_m^*$ the sets of rational numbers whose continued fraction, Egyptian fraction, and Engel fraction expansions have length $m$, respectively. We first establish the Minkowski dimensions of these sets, which implies that their global scaling properties are different. We also apply the results to sumsets of decreasing sequences.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Alejandro Borda, Julian Rincon, César Galindo &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** quant-ph &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** 17 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The efficient classical simulation of Clifford circuits constitutes a fundamental barrier to quantum advantage, typically overcome by injecting explicit non-Clifford "magic" resources. We demonstrate that for high-dimensional quantum systems (qudits), the resources required to break this barrier are strictly governed by the number-theoretic structure of the Hilbert space dimension $d$. By analyzing the adjoint action of the Clifford group, we establish a classification of single-qudit universality as a trichotomy. (I) For prime dimensions, the Clifford group is a maximal finite subgroup, and universality is robustly achieved by any non-Clifford gate. (II) For prime-power dimensions, the group structure fragments, requiring tailored diagonal non-Clifford gates to restore irreducibility. (III) Most notably, for composite dimensions with coprime factors, we demonstrate that standard entangling operations alone -- specifically, generalized intra-qudit CNOT gates -- generate the necessary non-Clifford resources to guarantee a dense subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(d)$ without explicit diagonal magic injection. Our proofs rely on a new geometric criterion establishing that a subgroup with irreducible adjoint action is infinite if it contains a non-scalar element with projective distance strictly less than $1/2$ from the identity. These results establish that "coprime architectures" -- hybrid registers combining subsystems with coprime dimensions -- can sustain universal computation using only classical entangling operations, rendering the explicit injection of magic resources algebraically unnecessary.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-23 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zetao Lin, Shiping Liu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using the Nakayama duality induced by a Nakayama functor, we provide a novel and concise account of the existence of Auslander-Reiten dualities and almost split sequences in abelian categories with enough projective objects or enough injective objects. As an example, we establish the existence of almost split sequences ending with finitely presented modules and those starting with finitely copresented modules in the category of all modules over a small endo-local Hom-reflexive category. Specializing to algebras given by (not necessarily finite) quivers with relations, we further investigate when the categories of finitely presented modules, finitely copresented modules and finite dimensional modules have almost split sequences on either or both sides.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 55 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a unified group-theoretic framework bridging the arithmetic homotopy exact sequence of a variety and the Birman exact sequence of a surface. Within this framework, we reinterpret classical arithmetic notions - such as the descent of varieties and of covers - and construct their topological analogues. We formalize the parallel setting between closed subgroups of the absolute Galois group and subgroups of the Mapping Class Group of a base space and their actions on fundamental groups. This provides an analogy between arithmetic and topological invariants, allowing us to define the groups of moduli, definition, and invariance in both settings. Using this unified perspective, some purely group-theoretic proofs provide results in both settings simultaneously. Applications include a topological analogue of Weil's Descent Theorem for mapping class groups and an adaptation of Débes and Douai's cohomological obstructions regarding descent of algebraic covers to the topological setting. Finally, we elevate these results to the categorical level. We demonstrate that the classical Weil cocycle condition is equivalent to the existence of a linearization in the language of equivariant categories. Applying this perspective to the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves $\mathsf{D^b}(X)$, we show that the equivariant derived category $\mathsf{D^b}(X)^G$, under the action induced by a Weil descent datum, recovers the derived category of the descended variety.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For $α\in \mathbb{R}$, let $$G_α:= \left< \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} , \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ α& 1 \end{bmatrix} \right> < \mathrm{SL}_2 (\mathbb{R}).$$ K. Kim and the first author established the orbit test, which provides a sufficient condition for $G_α$ not to be a rank-$2$ free group. In this article, we present two main applications of the orbit test. First, using the corresponding modulo homomorphism, we show that the converse of the orbit test does not hold. In particular, we construct explicit counterexamples, all of which are rational. As another application, we construct sequences of non-free rational numbers converging to $3$. These sequences are given by $$ 3 + \frac{3}{2 (9 n - 1)} \quad \text{and} \quad 3 + \frac{9 n + 5}{3 (2 n + 1) (9 n + 4)},$$ and their construction relies on the orbit test together with a modified Pell's equation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We let $f$ be a half-integral weight modular form of weight $κ>4$ on $Γ_0(4)$ that is an eigenfunction of all Hecke operators $T_n$, so that $T_nf = Λ_f(n)n^{\frac{κ-1}{2}}f$. Let $\|f\|$ denote the Petersson norm of $f$. We study a weighted second moment of the central value of the $L$-function associated to $f$ over an orthogonal basis $H_κ(4)$ of $S_κ(Γ_0(4))$. This corresponds to studying the following sum: $$\sum_{f\in H_κ(4)}\frac{Λ_f(n)\vert L(1/2,f)\vert^2}{\|f\|^2}.$$ Using the relative trace formula, we obtain an asymptotic formula for the second moment. We then use the method of amplification to get the subconvexity bound $$L(1/2,f)\ll_{\varepsilon} (κ^2)^{\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{40}+\varepsilon}.$$ This is the first subconvexity result for half-integral weight modular forms in the weight aspect. We also apply our second moment result to get a quantitative simultaneous non-vanishing result for central values of $L$-functions.</p></details>

Let $M_1, \ldots, M_\ell$ be unitarizable $\mathfrak{g}$-modules (with respect to $σ$), and let ${\bf z}=(z_1, \ldots, z_\ell) \in \mathbb{C}^\ell$. We investigate the action of the Bethe algebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathfrak{g}}^μ$ for $\mathfrak{g}$ with respect to $μ\in \mathfrak{g}^*$ on the tensor product $\underline{M}({\bf z}):=M_1(z_1) \otimes \cdots \otimes M_\ell(z_\ell)$ of evaluation $\mathfrak{g}[t]$-modules. We show that if $μ\circ σ$ equals the complex conjugation of $μ$, then $\mathcal{B}_{\mathfrak{g}}^μ$ is diagonalizable on any finite-dimensional $\mathcal{B}_{\mathfrak{g}}^μ$-submodule of $\underline{M}({\bf z})$ for ${\bf z} \in \mathbb{R}^\ell$. This, together with the result derived from the duality of Bethe algebras (see below), suggests that a simple spectrum conjecture for $\mathcal{B}_{\mathfrak{g}}^μ$ should hold. We establish a duality of Bethe algebras for the general linear Lie (super)algebras $\mathfrak{gl}_d$ and $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$. As an application, we show that under a generic condition, the Bethe algebra for $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$ with respect to ${\bf z} \in \mathbb{C}^{p+q+m+n}$ is diagonalizable with a simple spectrum on any weight space of $L_1(w_1) \otimes \cdots \otimes L_d(w_d)$, where the $L_i$ are (infinite-dimensional) unitarizable highest weight $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$-modules corresponding to generalized partitions of depth 1, and $w_1, \ldots, w_d \in \mathbb{C}$. We also obtain the corresponding result for $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m}$ by setting $q=n=0$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a method to prove a polyhedral branching formula for Kirillov-Reshetikhin (KR) modules over a quantum affine algebra. When the underlying simple Lie algebra is of exceptional type, such a formula remains conjectural in many cases. Using a linear recurrence relation satisfied by the characters of KR modules, we convert the verification of a polyhedral formula into an identity between two rational functions of a single variable with only simple poles at known locations. It is then sufficient to compare the residues at those poles, which are explicitly computable quantities. By applying this strategy, we obtain new, computer-assisted and easily verifiable proofs of known polyhedral formulas in types $F_4$ and $G_2$ within a uniform framework.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove finiteness and give an explicit upper bound on the number of $S$-integral points on affine curves satisfying a certain rank-genus inequality. We achieve this by developing an analogue of the Chabauty method, embedding the curve into its generalised Jacobian and bounding the Abel-Jacobi image of the $S$-integral points using arithmetic intersection theory. Our results also provide the foundations for a computational method to determine the set of $S$-integral points on affine curves which will be presented in a follow-up article.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a given elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$, let $N_p(E)$ be the number of points on $E$ modulo $p$ for a prime of good reduction for $E$. Given integer $n$, let $G_k(E,n)$ be the number of $k$-tuples of $p_1<p_2<\ldots <p_k$ primes of good reduction for $E$, for which the equation in the title holds, then on assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for elliptic curves without CM (and unconditionally if the curves have complex multiplication), I show that $\varlimsup_{n\to\infty} G_k(E,n)=\infty$ for any integer $k\geq 3$. I conjecture that this result also holds for $k=1,2$ i.e. this conjecture says that there are arbitrarily long ``elliptic progressions of primes'' i.e. sequences of primes $p_1<p_2<\cdots <p_m$ of arbitrary lengths $m$ such that $N_{p_1}(E)=N_{p_2}(E)=\cdots =N_{p_m}(E)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a letter from Tate to Serre dated March 26, 1974, Tate suggested a classification of weight one modular forms of prime level in terms of their associated odd Artin representations. This paper carries out an analogous classification of Maass wave forms of prime power level in terms of complex even representations. The parameters are identified with techniques from class field theory and Galois representations. The classification reveals that there exist distinct Maass cusp forms of tetrahedral type on $Γ_1(\ell)$ that remain inequivalent modulo $3$ for $\ell = 7687, 16363$ and $20887$, and that these $\ell$ are the three smallest such primes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the algebraic Picard group of the category of $K(n)$-local spectra, for all heights $n$ and all primes $p$. In particular, we show that it is always finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and, whenever $n \geq 2$, is of rank $2$, thereby confirming a prediction made by Hopkins in the early 1990s. In fact, with the exception of the anomalous case $n=p=2$, we provide a full set of topological generators for these groups. Our arguments rely on recent advances in $p$-adic geometry to translate the problem to a computation on Drinfeld's symmetric space, which can then be solved using results of Colmez--Dospinescu--Niziol.</p></details>

Recently, Liu and Weselcouch gave a formula for the coefficients of $K_{(P,w)}(x)$ when expanded in the quasisymmetric power sum function basis. This formula generalizes the classical Murnaghan--Nakayama rule for Schur functions.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Diophantine equation of type $U_n(x)=V_m(y)$, where $(U_n)_{n\geq 0}$ and $(V_m)_{m\geq 0}$ are polynomial power sums defined over a number field $K$. By applying the finiteness criterion of Bilu and Tichy, we show under appropriate assumptions that equation $U_n(x)=V_m(y)$ has infinitely many solutions with bounded $\mathcal{O}_S$-denominator. We also study decomposable polynomials in third and second order linear recurrence sequences. In particular, we show that if $W_n(x)=g(h(x))$ for a simple third order linear recurrence sequence $(W_n(x))_{n\geq 0}$ of complex polynomials, then deg $g$ is bounded. Furthermore, we show that if $(u_{n_1}+u_{n_2})(x)=g(h(x))$ for a binary recurrence sequence $(u_n(x))_{n\geq 0}$ then deg $g$ is bounded.</p></details>

We prove that the normalization of $A$ can be reconstructed from $L$ by taking the intersection of all maximal discrete valuation subrings. As a corollary, taking the field of fractions induces a fully faithful functor from the category of normal affinoid integral domains over $K$ to the category of field extensions of $K$. This provides another $p$-adic analogue of the Riemann Hebbarkeitssatz.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we obtain several new factorization results for certain classes of polynomials having integer coefficients. In doing so, we use the information about prime factorization of the value taken up by such polynomials and their higher order formal derivatives at sufficiently large integer arguments. If a lower bound for the minimum possible degree of a factor of such a polynomial is known a priori, then the integer argument becomes significantly smaller, which makes the underlying factorization result easier to apply. A result on explicit lower degree factor bound for the classes of polynomials considered in this paper is also proved via Newton polygons.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Hardy function $Z(t)=ζ(1/2+it)e^{iθ(t)}$ takes real values for real $t$ and its real zeros are zeros $ζ(s)$ on the critical line $1/2+it$. After discovering the critical value of the local maximum in 1956, Lehmer formulated the assumption that the Hardy function could have a negative local maximum or a positive local minimum. In the paper the Generalized Hardy function is defined as the real part of the Hardy function on any line $α_ν+it$ parallel to the critical line $1/2+it$ $$Z_{α_ν}(t)=Re\ ζ(α_ν+it)e^{iθ(t)}$$ and established an distinct relationship between the zeros of the $\cosθ(t)$ function and the zeros of the Generalized Hardy function. $$\forall ΔT_λ=(t_λ, t_{λ+1}],\ t_λ=2πλ^2,\ λ=1,\ 2,\ 3\ ...$$ $$\exists A_λ:\forall \hatα_λ>A_λ$$ $$|\cosθ(t) -Z_{\hatα_λ}(t)|<ε(A_λ),\ t\in ΔT_λ$$ Then the binomial series is used to establish a relationship between the values of the Generalized Hardy function on any two lines $α_ν+it$ and $α_{ν+1}+it$ parallel to the critical line. Thus, by induction between values $σ=1/2$ and $σ=\hatα_λ>A_λ$ $$α^{(λ)}_1<α^{(λ)}_2<α^{(λ)}_3<...<α^{(λ)}_ν<...<α^{(λ)}_{μ_λ}$$ an distinct relationship has been established between the zeros of the function $\cosθ(t)$ and the zeros of the Hardy function.</p></details>

To relate $p$-divisible groups and overconvergent $F$-isocrystals, we employ logarithmic Dieudonné theory, as introduced by Kato and further developed by Inoue. Over curves, this leads to an equivalence between the category of potentially semi-stable $p$-divisible groups and overconvergent $F$-isocrystals with slopes in the interval $[0,1]$.</p></details>

As an application, we obtain that the proportion of forms in the family with non-vanishing at the central point is at least $62.5\%$, assuming GRH. This is the highest non-vanishing proportion for any family associated with a unitary group. Moreover, this result indicates that the structural properties of $L$-functions play a more important role in extending the support than the associated symmetry group.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For finite-dimensional algebras over algebraically closed fields, we consider two fundamental classes of modules and their geometric counterparts: bricks and $τ$-rigid modules, as well as brick components and $τ$-regular components. We then apply our results in the study of some open conjectures. First, we investigate the situation where every brick is $τ$-rigid. We prove that this occurs exactly when the algebra is locally representation-directed; a family of algebras introduced by Dräxler in the 1990s, which are always representation-finite. Then, we adopt a geometric perspective and analyze the brick and $τ$-regular components of module varieties. In this greater generality, we establish new properties of such components. Inspired by some recent conjectures, we apply our results to the study of minimal brick-infinite algebras. Along the way, we construct some limits of rigid $g$-vectors, under a condition that we call the $τ$-convergence property. This construction is novel and, in certain cases, yields an integral $g$-vector lying outside the $τ$-tilting fan (a.k.a. $g$-vector fan). We show how our results provide new tools to the study of some open conjectures and particularly illustrate that for $E$-tame algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a field $\mathbb{F}$, what are all functions $f \colon \mathbb{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ that satisfy the functional equation $f \left( (x+y)/(x-y) \right) = (f(x) + f(y))/(f(x) - f(y))$ for all $ x \neq y$ in $\mathbb{F}$? We solve this problem for the fields $\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}$, and a class of its subfields that includes the real constructible numbers, the real algebraic numbers, and all quadratic number fields. We also solve it over the complex numbers and on any subfield of $\mathbb{R}$, if $f$ is continuous over the reals. The proofs involve a mix of algebra in all fields, analysis over the real line, and some topology in the complex plane.</p></details>

They generalize fractionally Calabi-Yau algebras and categorify de la Peña's algebras of cyclotomic type. Path algebras of affine type and (higher) canonical algebras are examples of Serre cyclotomic algebras. Our definition is related to Elias-Hogancamp's theory of categorical diagonalization. We compute the categorical entropy of their Serre functors, in the sense of Dimitrov-Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich, and use this to determine which graded path algebras and which homologically smooth graded gentle algebras are Serre cyclotomic. Finally, we show that trivial extension algebras of Serre cyclotomic algebras have finite global complexity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The algebraic notion of a pivotal module category was developed by Schaumann and Shimizu and is central to the description of boundary conditions in conformal field theory according to a proposal by Fuchs and Schweigert. In this paper, we present a large class of examples of pivotal module categories of topological origin: For a unimodular finite ribbon category $\mathcal{A}$, we prove that the factorization homology $\int_Σ\mathcal{A}$ of a compact oriented surface $Σ$ with $n$ marked boundary intervals, at least one per connected component, comes with the structure of a pivotal module category over $\mathcal{A}^{\boxtimes n}$. This endows the internal skein algebras of Ben-Zvi-Brochier-Jordan, in particular the elliptic double, with a symmetric Frobenius structure. As application, we obtain, for each choice of $\mathcal{A}$, a family of full open conformal field theories, each of which comes with correlation functions for all surfaces with marked boundary intervals that are explicitly computable using factorization homology. As a further application, we explain how modified traces can be 'integrated' over surfaces: We show that the modified trace for $\mathcal{A}$ extends in a canonical way to the factorization homology of $Σ$. The resulting traces have the remarkable property of being modular invariant, i.e. fixed by the mapping class group action.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The {\em Prym} of a cyclic covering of smooth projective curves is the ``new'' part of the Jacobian: the quotient of the Jacobian of the covering curve by the Jacobians of the intermediate covers. Given a family of such coverings, the fundamental group of the base of the family acts on the Tate modules of the Pryms, and the image of this representation is a key ingredient in answering arithmetic statistics questions about the distribution of the group structure of the $L$-torsion of a random Prym in the family. (Over ${\mathbb{F}}_q$, the action of Frobenius is roughly uniformly distributed over the {\em arithmetic} monodromy, a coset of the image of the fundamental group of the base change to $\bar{\mathbb{F}}_q$ (the {\em geometric} monodromy).) In the present note, we show for a number of natural families that (with limited exceptions) the geometric monodromy is sandwiched between a certain unitary group and its derived subgroup. In particular, this holds for the one-parameter families obtained by starting with any fixed cover and varying one (tame) ramification point. As an application, we deduce analogous largeness results for the monodromy of the Selmer groups of elliptic surfaces with $j=0$ or $j=1728$, by relating them to cyclic covers of degree 6 or 4 respectively, implying that their Selmer groups do not satisfy the standard heuristics. For instance, for eliptic surfaces with $j=0$ of sufficiently large height over ${\mathbb{P}}^1_{\mathbb{F}_q}$, the average size of the $l$-Selmer group is $l+3+o_q(1)$ when $l$ (fixed) and $q$ (large) are both 1 mod 3, compared to $l+1+o_q(1)$ for general elliptic surfaces.</p></details>

As an application, we determine the range of branch degrees for which Ulrich line bundles could exist, and we show that every even bidouble plane carries a special rank-two Ulrich bundle. Our method combines the invariant-theoretic decomposition of $H^2(S,\mathbb{Q})$ under the Galois group with cohomological criteria for Ulrich bundles.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Since the time of Minkowski a basic problem in number theory has been to find lower bounds for the absolute value $Δ(K)$ of the discriminant of a number field $K$ in terms of the degree $n(K)$ of $K$. In this paper we study another measure of the size of $K$ given by the covering radius $μ(K)$ of the ring of integers $O_K$ of $K$. Here $μ(K)$ is the $L^2$ radius $||V_2(K)||_2$ of the $L^2$ Voronoi cell $V_2(K)$ of $O_K$, where $V_2(K)$ is the set of points in $\mathbb{R} \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}} K$ that are at least as close to the origin as they are to any non-zero element of $O_K$. To put a limit on what lower bounds one can prove for $μ(K)$ in terms of $n(K)$, we study infinite families of $K$ of increasing degree for which $μ(K)$ can be bounded above by an explicit power of $n(K)$. We also study analogous questions when the $L^2$ norm is replaced by the $L^\infty$ norm.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There are three universal $2$-parameter vertex algebras $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$, $\mathcal{W}^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$, and $\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ which are freely generated of types $\mathcal{W}(2,3,4,\dots)$, $\mathcal{W}(2,4,6,\dots)$, and $\mathcal{W}(1^3, 2, 3^3, 4,\dots)$, respectively. They serve as classifying objects for vertex algebras with these generating types satisfying mild hypotheses. Their $1$-parameter quotients are expected to be the building blocks of all $\mathcal{W}$-algebras of classical Lie types. Furthermore, such $\mathcal{W}$-algebras are expected to be organized into families that are governed by new universal $2$-parameter vertex algebras, which are themselves glueings of copies of $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$ in type $A$ (together with a Heisenberg algebra), and copies of $\mathcal{W}^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$ and $\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ in types $B$, $C$, and $D$. We denote these universal objects by $\mathcal{W}^{X,S,M}_{\infty}$, where $X$ denotes the Lie type (either $A$, $C$, or $BD$ since types $B$ and $D$ can be treated uniformly), and $S$, $M$ are sets of positive integers that determine certain families of partitions. More precisely, for a partition $P = (n_0^{m_0}, n_1^{m_1},\dots, n_{t}^{m_t})$ of $N = \sum_{i=0}^t n_i m_i$ consisting of $m_i$ parts of size $n_i$, where $n_0> n_1 > \cdots > n_t \geq 2$, $M = \{m_0,\dots, m_t\}$ is the set of multiplicities, and $S = \{d_1,\dots, d_t\}$ is the set of height differences $d_{i+1} = n_i - n_{i+1}$. After introducing this general conjectural picture, we will construct the first nontrivial example $\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{so}_2}_{\infty}:=\mathcal{W}^{BD, \emptyset, \{2\}}_{\infty}$, which is a glueing of two copies of $\mathcal{W}^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$.</p></details>

This leaves $33_{65}$ as the only remaining relation algebra in the family $N_{65}$ with a flexible atom that is not known to be finitely representable. Motivated by this, we complement our upper bounds with some lower bounds. Using a SAT solver, we show that $33_{65}$ is not finitely representable on fewer than $24$ points, and that $33_{65}$ does not admit a cyclic group representation on fewer than $120$ points.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a perfect ring of characteristic $p>0$, and let $R$ be an animated $k$-algebra. This note aims to show that the Nygaard filtered prismatization $R^{\mathrm{Nyg}}$ of $R$ is naturally isomorphic, as a stack over $k^{\mathrm{Nyg}}$, to the relative spectrum over $k^{\mathrm{Nyg}}$ of the Rees algebra of the Nygaard filtered prismatic cohomology of $R$ relative to $k$. In doing so, we axiomatise the functorial affineness property displayed by the relative Nygaard filtered prismatization, and dub it de Rham affineness after the fundamental example of the functor sending an animated ring to its relative de Rham stack. While we treat this concept as an organising tool for the author's forthcoming work on the syntomification of Frobenius liftable schemes, we are able to frame some questions based on a structural theorem of independent interest: a functor to stacks which is de Rham affine often arises via ring stacks through transmutation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A problem raised by Cuadra and Simson in 2007 asks whether any locally finitely presented Grothendieck category with enough flat objects also has enough projectives. In this paper, we start from a key observation: a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category has enough flat objects if, and only if, it has exact products. This enables several equivalent reformulations of the problem, allowing us to identify a counterexample (thus providing a negative solution to the problem), while also connecting it to a classical ring-theoretical question posed by Miller in 1975, and even to the Telescope Conjecture for compactly generated triangulated categories. Moreover, we describe several classes of Grothendieck categories where the problem can be answered affirmatively. For example, we show that a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category whose category of finitely presented objects is Krull--Schmidt has enough flats if, and only if, it is generated by a family of finitely generated projectives.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define several versions of a class of varieties $X_{\mathfrak{g}}$ attached to a complex reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, generalizing the Hilbert scheme of points on the plane. These include trigonometric and elliptic versions attached to the corresponding groups. We also define the corresponding isospectral varieties $Y_{\mathfrak{g}}$. We prove a Gordon-Stafford localization theorem for $X_{\mathfrak{g}}$ and the corresponding equal-parameter rational Cherednik algebras, relate these varieties to the affine Springer fiber-sheaf correspondence of arXiv:2204.00303, and discuss examples. We conjecture that the torus-fixed points of our varieties are in bijection with two-sided cells in the finite Weyl group and prove this in types $ABC$. We relate these results to known results about Calogero-Moser spaces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the shrinking target and recurrence set associated to non-autonomous measure-preserving systems on compact metric spaces, establishing zero-one criteria in the spirit of classical Borel-Cantelli results. Our first main theorem gives a quantitative shrinking target result for non-autonomous systems under a uniform mixing condition, providing asymptotics with an optimal error term. This general result is applicable to certain families of inner functions, yielding concrete applications such as patterns of zeros in the multibase expansion. Turning to recurrence, we establish new zero-measure laws for non-autonomous systems. In the autonomous case, we prove a zero-one criterion for recurrence sets of centred, one-component inner functions via Markov partitions and distortion estimates. Together, these results provide a unified framework for shrinking target and recurrence problems in both autonomous and non-autonomous dynamics.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a deterministic algorithm based on Coppersmith's method that employs a rank-3 lattice to address factoring-related problems. An interesting aspect of our approach is that we utilize the second vector in the LLL-reduced basis to avoid trivial collisions in the Baby-step Giant-step method, rather than the shortest vector as is commonly used in the literature. Our results are as follows: 1. Compared to the result by Harvey and Hittmeir (Math. Comp. 91 (2022), 1367 - 1379), who achieved a complexity of O( N^(1/5) log^(16/5) N / (log log N)^(3/5)) for factoring a semiprime N = pq, we demonstrate that in the balanced p and q case, the complexity can be improved to O( N^(1/5) log^(13/5) N / (log log N)^(3/5) ). 2. For factoring sums and differences of powers, that is, numbers of the form N = a^n plus or minus b^n, we improve Hittmeir's result (Math. Comp. 86 (2017), 2947 - 2954) from O( N^(1/4) log^(3/2) N ) to O( N^(1/5) log^(13/5) N ). 3. For the problem of finding r-power divisors, that is, finding all integers p such that p^r divides N, Harvey and Hittmeir (Proceedings of ANTS XV, Research in Number Theory 8 (2022), no. 4, Paper No. 94) recently directly applied Coppersmith's method and achieved a complexity of O( N^(1/(4r)) log^(10+epsilon) N / r^3 ). By using faster LLL-type algorithms and sieving on small primes, we improve their result to O( N^(1/(4r)) log^(7+3 epsilon) N / ((log log N minus log(4r)) r^(2+epsilon)) ). The worst-case running time for their algorithm occurs when N = p^r q with q on the order of N^(1/2). By focusing on this case and employing our rank-3 lattice approach, we achieve a complexity of O( r^(1/4) N^(1/(4r)) log^(5/2) N ). In conclusion, we offer a new perspective on these problems, which we hope will provide further insights.</p></details>

Choose a holomorphic involution of $G$ and let $K$ be its set of fixed points. The group $K$ acts on the flag variety $G/B$ with finitely many orbits and Brion has derived a general formula for the cohomology classes of the corresponding orbit closures as linear combinations of Schubert classes. This article provide a uniform description of the sets of Weyl group elements (which we refer to as Brion atoms) indexing the terms in this formula. This builds on prior work addressing types A, B, and C. The main novelty of our results is a thorough treatment of type D. As one application, we introduce a notion of involution Schubert polynomials for all classical types and present several conjectures related to these objects.</p></details>

Let $\ell$ and $p$ be primes which are coprime to $6N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}({\mathrm cond}(λ))$. We determine the $\ell$-adic valuation of Hecke $L$-values $L(1,λχ)/Ω_K$ as $χ$ varies over $p$-power order anticyclotomic characters over $K$. As an application, for $p$ inert in $K$, we prove the vanishing of the $μ$-invariant of Rubin's $p$-adic $L$-function, leading to the first results on the $μ$-invariant of imaginary quadratic fields at non-split primes. Our approach and results complement the work of Hida and Finis. The approach is rooted in the arithmetic of a CM form on a definite Shimura set.The application to Rubin's $p$-adic $L$-function also relies on the proof of his conjecture. Along the way, we present an automorphic view on Rubin's theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study \emph{fake Mobius-type functions on the unit circle}: multiplicative functions $\mathfrak f$ determined by prime-power data $\mathfrak f(p^k)=\varepsilon_k\in\mathbb S^1\cup\{0\}$, independent of $p$. Their Dirichlet series admits the Euler product $$ F_{\mathfrak f}(s)=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\mathfrak f(n)}{n^s} =\prod_p g(p^{-s}),\qquad g(u)=\sum_{k\ge0}\varepsilon_k u^k, $$ and a canonical zeta-factorization $$ F_{\mathfrak f}(s)=ζ(s)^{\,z}\,ζ(2s)^{\,w}\,G_{\mathfrak f}(s), \qquad z=\varepsilon_1,\ \ w=\varepsilon_2-\frac{\varepsilon_1(\varepsilon_1+1)}{2}, $$ where $G_{\mathfrak f}(s)$ is a holomorphic Euler product on $\Re s>1/3$. Assuming the Riemann hypothesis and simplicity of zeros, we derive a general explicit and asymptotic formula for the summatory functions $A_{\mathfrak f}^{\exp}(x)$ of the form $$ A_{\mathfrak f}^{\exp}(x) -Δ_1(x;z,w) = Δ_{1/2}(x;z,w)\;+\;\sum_ρΔ_ρ(x;z,w,\mathfrak f)\;+\;\mathcal E(x), $$ where $Δ_1(x;z,w)$ is the main term coming from the $s=1$ singularity of $ζ(s)^z$, $Δ_{1/2}(x;z,w)$ is the secondary term coming from the $s=1/2$ singularity of $ζ(2s)^w$, the terms $Δ_ρ(x;z,w,\mathfrak f)$ arise from the singularities of $ζ(s)^z$ at nontrivial zeros $ρ$ of $ζ(s)$, and $\mathcal E(x)$ is an error term. Furthermore, we introduce a notion of \emph{bias} at the natural scale $x^{1/2}(\Log x)^{w-1}$ and obtain an explicit criteria distinguishing persistent, apparent, and unbiased behavior in this regime. The present paper treats the major parameter region $$ -1\le\Re(z)\le1,\qquad -2\le\Re(w)<1, $$ and we choose to defer the complementary ranges of $(z,w)$ to a future paper as a different analytic approach is required there.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Schurian-finiteness, also known as $τ$-tilting finiteness, is equivalent to the finiteness of various representation theoretic objects such as wide subcategories. The first three authors classified Schurian-finite blocks of type A Hecke algebras in [ALS23]. Here we study the Schurian-finiteness of blocks of type B Hecke algebras, and determine the Schurian-finiteness of all blocks if the Hecke algebra is `non-integral', and for almost all blocks in the integral case. The only remaining cases are a small number of blocks in defect $3$ when $e=3$, and a family of blocks in defects $3$ and $4$ for $e\geqslant4$. The classification is mostly achieved by methods using decomposition numbers, with many degenerate cases requiring direct study using standard methods from the representation theory of quivers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unit-generated orders of a quadratic field are orders of the form $\mathcal{O} = \mathbb{Z}[\varepsilon]$, where $\varepsilon$ is a unit in the quadratic field. If the order $\mathcal{O}$ is a maximal order of a real quadratic field, then the quadratic number field is necessarily of a restricted form, being of narrow Richaud--Degert type. However, every real quadratic field contains infinitely many distinct unit-generated orders. They are parametrized as $\mathcal{O} = \mathcal{O}_{n}^{\pm}$ having quadratic discriminants $Δ(\mathcal{O}) = Δ_{n}^{+} = n^2 - 4$ (for $n \geq 3$) and $Δ(\mathcal{O}) = Δ_{n}^{-} = n^2 + 4$ (for $n \geq 1$). We show the (wide or narrow) class numbers of unit-generated orders satisfy $\log \left|{\rm Cl}(\mathcal{O})\right| \sim \log \frac{1}{2}\left|Δ(\mathcal{O})\right|$ as $\left|Δ(\mathcal{O})\right| \to \infty$, using a result of L.-K. Hua. We deduce that there are finitely many unit-generated quadratic orders of class number one and finitely many unit-generated quadratic orders whose class group is $2$-torsion. We classify all unit-generated real quadratic maximal orders having class number one. We provide numerical lists of quadratic unit-generated orders whose class groups are $2$-torsion for $Δ\leq 10^{10}$, for both wide and narrow class groups, which are conjecturally complete.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Following Gluck and Wolf we complete the Itô--Michler's Theorem for the projective representations of a $p$-solvable or $π$-separable group, and then we relate the projective irreducible modules of such a group with those of its Sylow $p$-subroups and Hall $π$-subgroups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Consider a reductive group G over a non-archimedean local field. The Galois group Gal(C/Q) acts naturally on the category of smooth complex G-representations. We prove that this action stabilizes the class of standard modules. This generalizes and relies on an analogous result about essentially square-integrable representations. Other important objects in the proof of our main result are intertwining operators between parabolically induced G-representations, and the associated Harish-Chandra μ-functions. We determine an explicit formula for the μ-function of any irreducible representation of any Levi subgroup of G.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The basis functions of the Fourier interpolation formula of Radchenko and Viazovska, constructed by means of weakly holomorphic modular forms for the Hecke theta group, are entire functions of order $2$ having interesting time-frequency properties. We give precise size estimates and study the distribution of zeros of these functions. We give in particular asymptotic estimates for the location and the number of extraneous zeros on or close to the real line. This result reveals the surprising existence of Fourier nonuniqueness pairs whose apparent ``excess'' compared to the Fourier uniqueness pair of Radchenko and Viazovska may be made arbitrarily large. Our estimates also show that the basis functions fail to yield a Riesz basis in the Hilbert space used by Kulikov, Nazarov, and Sodin in their recent study of Fourier uniqueness pairs. Some numerical data are presented, suggesting additional fine scale properties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study a new perspective on a certain Pieri rules for classical groups. Furthermore, we extend a fundamental theorem of Kostant concerning tensor products for classical groups. We show that a certain form of the Pieri rule is equivalent to the converse of this extended version of Kostant's theorem. In addition, we show an equivalence between the Pieri rule and the branching rule for general linear groups.</p></details>

### \[<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19503v2'>2511.19503</a>\]&nbsp; **On Some Generalisations of Gauss Sequences**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Sathyanarayan Narayan, N. Uday Kiran &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce integer sequences satisfying new congruence properties inspired by the Euler and Gauss congruences, which we call Euler-Gauss sequences. Noting that every Gauss sequence is an Euler-Gauss sequence, we compare them with certain generalisations of Gauss sequences and provide several counterexamples. In particular, the Smallest Prime Factor (SPF) and Greatest Prime Factor (GPF) sequences (suitably defined at 1) studied extensively by Erdos and Alladi arise as natural examples of Euler-Gauss sequences that are not Gauss sequences. We further extend these congruence-based integer sequences to a q-analog setting and establish characteristic properties that reveal their structure and fill gaps in the literature on q-Gauss sequences. In recent works, q-Gauss sequences have been shown to admit interesting combinatorial interpretations and to exhibit the Cyclic Sieving Phenomenon (CSP). Not only do our q-Euler-Gauss sequences satisfy the standard CSP with some restriction, but we also derive a new CSP condition for the SPF and GPF sequences, not hitherto known in the literature.</p></details>
