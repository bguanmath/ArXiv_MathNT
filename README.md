### \[<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18857v1'>2510.18857</a>\]&nbsp; **Irreducibility and Galois groups of random reciprocal polynomials of large degree**


 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** David Hokken, Dimitris Koukoulopoulos &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A = a_0T^m + \sum_{j=1}^{m-1} a_j (T^{m-j}+T^{m+j}) + T^{2m}+1 \in \mathbf{Z}[T]$ be a monic reciprocal polynomial of degree $2m$ sampled randomly by selecting its coefficients $a_0,a_1,\dots,a_{m-1}$ independently according to a given probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbf{Z}$. For a wide range of measures $\mu$, we prove that $A$ is irreducible with probability $\ge 1-Cm^{-c}$ for some absolute constants $c,C>0$. In addition, we prove that with the same probability the Galois group of $A$ is either the full hyperoctahedral group $\mathcal{C}_2 \wr \mathcal{S}_m$ or one of two of its index-$2$ subgroups. The main condition that $\mu$ must satisfy is of Fourier-theoretic nature, and holds for example when $\mu$ is the uniform measure on a set of at least $35$ consecutive integers, or on an arbitrary, sufficiently large subset of an interval $[-H,H]$, with $H$ larger than some absolute constant. Our most general result allows for each $a_j$ to be sampled by its own probability measure $\mu_j$. Our approach builds on earlier work of Bary-Soroker, Kozma and the second author, who proved for essentially the same $\mu_j$ that the 'standard' monic polynomial $a_0 + \cdots + a_{m-1}T^{m-1} + T^m$ is irreducible and has as Galois group either the symmetric group $\mathcal{S}_m$ or the alternating group $\mathcal{A}_m$ with high probability, conditioning on $a_0 \neq 0$. In our setting of reciprocal polynomials, we can rule out (all subgroups of) the maximal alternating subgroup $(\mathcal{C}_2 \wr \mathcal{S}_m) \cap \mathcal{A}_{2m}$ of the hyperoctahedral group as likely Galois group of $A$ by analyzing its discriminant.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study Dirichlet series arising as linear functionals on an inner product space of meromorphic functions and establish a relation between the discontinuities of the former on the boundary and the poles and zeros of the latter on the imaginary axis. As an example application of Delange's Tauberian theorem, it is shown that the conjectured asymptotic in the additive divisor problem follows conditionally on the non-vanishing of certain meromorphic functions on the imaginary axis.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is known that Hilbert's Tenth Problem over the Gaussian ring $\mathbb Z[i]=\{a+bi:\ a,b\in\mathbb Z\}$ is undecidable. In this paper we obtain the following further result: There is no algorithm to decide whether an arbitrarily given polynomial equation $P(z_1,\ldots,z_{20})=0$ (with integer coefficients) is solvable over $\mathbb Z[i]$. This improves the previous record involving $52$ variables.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Comments are welcome!

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For any set $A$ of natural numbers with positive upper Banach density, we show the existence of an infinite set $B$ and sequences $(t_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}, (s_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ of natural numbers such that $\left\{ \sum_{n \in F}n : F \subset B + s_k, 1 \leq |F| \leq k \right\}\subset A-t_k$, for every $k\in \mathbb{N}$. This strengthens the density finite sums theorem of Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson. We further show, given such a set $A$, the existence of an infinite set $B$ and a sequence $(t_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ of natural numbers such that $\left\{ \sum_{n \in F}n : F \subset B, |F| = k \right\}\subset A-t_k$, for every $k\in \mathbb{N}$. As a corollary, we obtain a sequence $(B_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ of infinite sets of natural numbers such that $B_1+\cdots +B_k \subset A$, for every $k\in \mathbb{N}$. We also establish the optimality of our main theorems by providing counterexamples to potential further generalizations, and thereby addressing questions of the aforementioned authors in the context of density analogs to Hindman's finite sums theorem.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 40 pages, 1 figure; comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a construction of eventually periodic projective resolutions for modules of type $\textbf{FP}_{\infty}$ over the integral group rings of $\Gamma = G / (c)$ of type $\textbf{VFP}$, with $G$ of type $\textbf{FP}$ and $c$ a central element. Our approach also applies more generally to quotients of rings of finite left global dimension by a regular central element. It utilizes a construction of Shamash, combined with the iterated mapping cone technique, to systematically `purge' homology from a complex. We demonstrate the computability of our method through explicit calculations for several families of groups including hyperbolic triangle groups and mapping class groups of the punctured plane.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce a universal framework for boundary transfer matrices, inspired by Sklyanin's two-row transfer matrix approach for quantum integrable systems with boundary conditions. The main examples arise from quantum symmetric pairs of finite and affine type. As a special case we recover a construction by Kolb in finite type. We review recent work on universal solutions to the reflection equation and highlight several open problems in this field.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work we classify the thick subcategories of the bounded derived category of dg modules over a Koszul complex on any list of elements in a regular ring. This simultaneously recovers a theorem of Stevenson when the list of elements is a regular sequence and the classification of thick subcategories for an exterior algebra over a field (via the BGG correspondence). One of the major ingredients is a classification of thick tensor submodules of perfect curved dg modules over a commutative noetherian graded ring concentrated in even degrees, recovering a theorem of Hopkins and Neeman. We give several consequences of the classification result over a Koszul complex, one being that the lattice of thick subcategories of the bounded derived category is fixed by Grothendieck duality.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Apoorva Khare, Jacob P. Matherne, Avery St. Dizier &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.RT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** Added Sections 5.1 and 5.2 on failure of log-concavity in other Lie types and for Jack/Macdonald polynomials. Added Appendix A, exploring the log-concavity of arbitrary simple highest weight characters in type A

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In 2022, Huh-Matherne-M\'esz\'aros-St. Dizier showed that normalized Schur polynomials are Lorentzian, thereby yielding their continuous (resp. discrete) log-concavity on the positive orthant (resp. on their support, in type $A$ root directions). A reinterpretation of this result is that the characters of finite-dimensional simple representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ are denormalized Lorentzian (DL). In the same paper, these authors also showed that shifted characters of Verma modules over $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ are DL. In this work we extend these results to a larger family of modules that subsumes both of the above: we show that shifted characters of all parabolic Verma modules over $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ are denormalized Lorentzian. The proof involves certain graphs on $[n+1]$; more strongly, we explain why the character (i.e., generating function) of the Kostant partition function of any loopless multigraph on $[n+1]$ is Lorentzian after shifting and normalizing. We then show that parabolic Vermas form a "maximal" class with log-concave (hence DL) characters. Namely, log-concavity fails in greater generality along three natural directions: (1) it does not hold for every simple Lie type, (2) nor for a larger universal family of highest weight modules, the higher order Verma modules, even in type $A$, and (3) it does not always hold for important generalizations of Schur polynomials: the Jack and Macdonald polynomials. Finally, we extend these results to parabolic (i.e. "first order") and higher order Verma modules over the semisimple Lie algebras $\oplus_{t=1}^T \mathfrak{sl}_{n_t+1}(\mathbb{C})$. We also partially resolve a conjecture of Huh et al on the DL property for integral highest weight simple modules.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Cheng Zheng &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.DS &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we study a shrinking target problem with target at infinity in a homogeneous space of a semisimple algebraic group from the representation-theoretic point of view. Let $\rho:\mathbf G\to\mathbf{GL}(V)$ be an irreducible $\mathbb Q$-rational representation of a connected semisimple $\mathbb Q$-algebraic group $\mathbf G$ on a complex vector space $V$, $\{a_t\}_{t\in\mathbb R}$ a one-parameter subgroup in a $\mathbb Q$-split torus in $\mathbf G$ and $\psi:\mathbb R_+\to\mathbb R_+$ a positive function on $\mathbb R_+$. We define a subset $S_\rho(\psi)$ of $\psi$-Diophantine elements in $\mathbf G(\mathbb R)$ in terms of the representation $\rho$ and $\{a_t\}_{t\in\mathbb R}$, and prove formulas for the Hausdorff dimension of the complement of $S_{\rho}(\psi)$. We also discuss the connections of our results to Diophantine approximation on flag varieties and rational approximation to linear subspaces in Grassmann varieties.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 8 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we construct a $p$-adic path integral via $p$-adic multiple integrals. This integral describes the evolution of a wave function $\Psi(x)$, which is defined as a map from a domain in $\mathbb{C}_{p}$ to $\mathbb{C}_{p}$. We also compute the Feynman propagator for free particles, demonstrating that the result obtained is similar to the classical counterparts.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-10-21 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Li Zhu, Hongfeng Wu &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $f(X)$ be a nonconstant polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, with a nonzero constant term. The order of $f(X)$ is a classical notion in the theory of polynomials over finite fields, and recently the definition of freeness of binomials of $f(X)$ was given in \cite{Mart\'{i}nez}. Generalizing these two notions, we introduce the definition of the minimal binomial multiple of $f(X)$ in this paper, which is the monic binomial with the lowest degree among the binomials over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ divided by $f(X)$. Based on the equivalent characterization of binomials via the defining sets of their radicals, we prove that a series of properties of the classical order can be naturally generalized to this case. In particular, the minimal binomial multiple of $f(X)$ is presented explicitly in terms of the defining set of the radical of $f(X)$. And a criterion for $f(X)$ being free of binomials is given. As an application, for any positive integer $N$ and nonzero element $\lambda$ in $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, the $\lambda$-constacyclic codes of length $N$ with minimal distance $2$ are determined.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The extended Riemann hypothesis (ERH) for Dedekind zeta functions remains one of the most elusive open problems in number theory. Over the last century, many equivalent statements to the classical Riemann hypothesis alone have been discovered. We prove that the closed form of some infinite series over the non-trivial zeros of Dedekind zeta functions holds if and only if ERH is true.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 49 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct period sheaves for Hamiltonian spaces, as conjectured in the work of Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis and Venkatesh, using the perverse pullback functors introduced in the authors' previous work. We prove a dimensional reduction isomorphism (generalizing the results of Davison and Kinjo in cohomological Donaldson--Thomas theory) which implies that perverse pullbacks refine the ordinary pullback functors in constructible sheaf theory, and relate perverse pullbacks to microstalk functors. These results imply that our period sheaves recover the known constructions in the cotangent and Whittaker cases.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 21 pages. Minor changes relative to the previous version

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A much-studied problem posed by Motzkin asks to determine, given a finite set $D$ of integers, the so-called Motzkin density for $D$, i.e., the supremum of upper densities of sets of integers whose difference set avoids $D$. We study the natural analogue of this problem in compact abelian groups. Using ergodic-theoretic tools, this is shown to be equivalent to the following discrete problem: given a lattice $\Lambda\subset \mathbb{Z}^r$, letting $D$ be the image in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$ of the standard basis, determine the Motzkin density for $D$ in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$. We study in particular the periodicity question: is there a periodic $D$-avoiding set of maximal density in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$? The Greenfeld--Tao counterexample to the periodic tiling conjecture implies that the answer can be negative. On the other hand, we prove that the answer is positive in several cases, including the case rank$(\Lambda)=1$ (in which we give a formula for the Motzkin density), the case rank$(\Lambda)=r-1$, and hence also the case $r\leq 3$. It follows that, for up to three missing differences, the Motzkin density in a compact abelian group is always a rational number.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Dedicated to G\'erard Laumon. Updated references

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article establishes a geometric Satake equivalence for affine Kac-Moody groups as an equivalence of abelian semisimple categories over algebraically closed fields. We define a well-behaved category of equivariant sheaves on the double affine grassmannian \Gr_{G}, seen as a infty-stack, that we equip with a t-structure. We obtain an Braden's hyperbolic localization theorem for such a stack and prove that the constant term functor is t-exact using dimension estimates for affine MV-cycles. We then deduce the sought-for equivalence and prove that the IC-complexes match with the irreducible highest weight representations of the Langlands dual group G^{\vee}.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field, and let $F \in \mathbb{F}_q [X]$ be a polynomial with $d = \text{deg} \left( F \right)$ such that $\gcd \left( d, q \right) = 1$. In this paper we prove that the $c$-Boomerang uniformity, $c \neq 0$, of $F$ is bounded by - $d^2$ if $c^2 \neq 1$, - $d \cdot (d - 1)$ if $c = -1$, - $d \cdot (d - 2)$ if $c = 1$. For all cases of $c$, we present tight examples for $F \in \mathbb{F}_q [X]$. Additionally, for the proof of $c = 1$ we establish that the bivariate polynomial $F (x) - F (y) + a \in k [x, y]$, where $k$ is a field of characteristic $p$ and $a \in k \setminus \{ 0 \}$, is absolutely irreducible if $p \nmid \text{deg} \left( F \right)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The weighted triangulation algebras associated to triangulation quivers and their socle deformations were recently introduced and studied in [15]-[20] and [2]. These algebras, based on surface triangulations and originated from the theory of cluster algebras, were also proved to be (with some minor exceptions) finite-dimensional tame symmetric and periodic algebras of period 4. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of a generalized triangulation quiver, extending the notion of a triangulation quiver. Inparticular, it is also shown that the generalized triangulation quivers can be constructed from triangulations of orientable surfaces with marked self-foldedtriangles. Moreover, motivated by the recent results of [28], we define and investigate so called weighted generalized triangulation algebras associated to generalized triangulation quivers, which naturally arise from mutations of weighted triangulation algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study a quantitative notion of exactness within Diophantine approximation. Given $\Psi:(0,\infty)\to (0,\infty)$ and $\omega:(0,\infty)\to (0,1)$ satisfying $\lim_{q\to\infty}\omega(q)=0$, we study the set of points, which we call $E(\Psi,\omega)$, that are $\Psi$-well approximable but not $\Psi(1-\omega)$-well approximable. We prove results on the cardinality and dimension of $E(\Psi,\omega)$. In particular we obtain the following general statements: (i) For any $\omega:(0,\infty)\to (0,1)$ and $\tau>2$ there exists $\Psi:(0,\infty)\to (0,\infty)$ such that $\lim_{q\to\infty}\frac{-\log \Psi(q)}{\log q}=\tau$ and $E(\Psi,\omega)\neq\emptyset.$ (ii) Under natural monotonicity assumptions on $\Psi$ and $\omega,$ we prove that if $\omega$ decays to zero sufficiently slowly (in a way that depends upon $\Psi$) then $E(\Psi,\omega)$ is uncountable. Moreover, under further natural assumptions on $\Psi$ we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension of $E(\Psi,\omega)$. Our main result demonstrates a new threshold for the behaviour of $E(\Psi,\omega)$. A particular instance of this threshold is illustrated by considering functions of the form $\Psi_{\tau}(q)=q^{-\tau}$ when $\tau\in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 3}$. For these functions we prove the following: (iii) If $\omega(q)= Cq^{-\tau(\tau-1)}$ for some sufficiently large $C$ or $\omega(q)=q^{-\tau'}$ for some $\tau'<\tau(\tau-1),$ then $E(\Psi_{\tau},\omega)$ is uncountable and we calculate its Hausdorff dimension. (iv) If $\omega(q)< cq^{-\tau(\tau-1)}$ for some $c\in (0,1)$ for all $q$ sufficiently large then $E(\Psi_{\tau},\omega)=\emptyset.$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Collatz and $abc$ conjectures, both well known and thoroughly studied, appear to be largely unrelated at first sight. We show that assuming the $abc$ conjecture true is helpful to improve the lower bound of integers initiating a particular type of Collatz sequences, namely finite sequences of a given length where all terms but one are odd with the usual ``shortcut'' form. To obtain sharper bounds in this context, we are led to consider a small subset of the $abc$-hits. Then, it turns out that Collatz iterations as well as Wieferich primes may be used to find large triples in this subset.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider the generalized character $\Psi_{1,p,G}$ of a finite group $G$ which vanishes on all $p$-singular elements of $G$ and whose value at each $p$-regular $y \in G$ is the number of $p$-elements of $C_{G}(y)$. We conjecture that this is always a character, and may be afforded by a projective $RG$-module, where $R$ is an appropriate complete discrete valuation ring whose residue field has characteristic $p$. We examine a number of case where this is the case, and consider consequences for the representation theory and character theory of $G$ when this conjecture is known to hold. In particular, we prove, among other things, that the conjecture is valid for all primes $p$ in the case that $G \cong {\rm PSL}(2,q)$ or ${\rm SL}(2,q)$ for every prime power $q$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra, $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ its quantum group, and $U_q(\mathfrak{k}) \subset U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ a quantum symmetric pair subalgebra determined by a Lie algebra automorphism $\theta$. We introduce a category $W_\theta$ of weight $U_q(\mathfrak{k})$-modules, which is acted on by the category of weight $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-modules via tensor products. We construct a universal tensor K-matrix $\mathbb{K}$ (that is, a solution of a reflection equation) in a completion of $U_q(\mathfrak{k}) \otimes U_q(\mathfrak{g})$. This yields a natural operator on any tensor product $M \otimes V$, where $M\in W_\theta$ and $V\in {O}_\theta$, that is $V$ is a $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-module in category ${O}$ satisfying an integrability property determined by $\theta$. Canonically, $W_\theta$ is equipped with a structure of a bimodule category over ${O}_\theta$ and the action of $\mathbb{K}$ is encoded by a new categorical structure, which we call a boundary structure on $W_\theta$. This generalizes a result of Kolb which describes a braided module structure on finite-dimensional $U_q(\mathfrak{k})$-modules when $\mathfrak{g}$ is finite-dimensional. We also consider our construction in the case of the category ${C}$ of finite-dimensional modules over a quantum affine algebra, providing the most comprehensive universal framework to date for large families of solutions of parameter-dependent reflection equations. In this case the tensor K-matrix gives rise to a formal Laurent series with a well-defined action on tensor products of any module in $W_\theta$ and any module in ${C}$. This series can be normalized to an operator-valued rational function, which we call trigonometric tensor K-matrix, if both factors in the tensor product are in ${C}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a complex simple Lie algebra and $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$ the corresponding quantum affine algebra. We prove that every irreducible finite-dimensional $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$-module gives rise to a family of trigonometric solutions of Cherednik's generalized reflection equation. These depend upon the choice of a quantum affine symmetric pair $U_q(\mathfrak{k})\subset U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$. Our result relies on the construction of universal K-matrices for arbitrary quantum symmetric pairs, obtained in our previous work, as well as the fact that every irreducible $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$-module is generically irreducible under restriction to $U_q({\mathfrak{k}})$. In the case of small modules and Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules, we obtain new solutions of the standard and the transposed reflection equations.</p></details>

We prove that new examples of such universal K-matrices arise from quantum symmetric pairs of Kac-Moody type and depend upon the choice of a pair of generalized Satake diagrams. In finite type, this yields a refinement of a result obtained by Balagovi\'c and Kolb, producing a family of non-equivalent solutions interpolating between the quasi-K-matrix originally due to Bao and Wang and the full universal K-matrix. Finally, we prove that this construction yields formal solutions of the generalized reflection equation with a spectral parameter in the case of finite-dimensional representations over the quantum affine algebra $U_qL\mathfrak{sl}_2$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the truncated symbol $\mathrm{Symb}_0(\mathbb{D})$ of a differential symmetry breaking operator $\mathbb{D}$ between parabolically induced representations. This generalizes the symbol map $\mathrm{Symb}$, which is defined for the case of abelian nilpotent radicals, to the non-abelian setting. The inverse $\mathrm{Symb}_0^{-1}$ of the truncated symbol map $\mathrm{Symb}_0$ enables one to apply a recipe of the F-method for any nilpotent radical. As an application, we classify and construct differential intertwining operators $\mathcal{D}$ on the full flag variety $SL(3,\mathbb{R})/B$ and homomorphisms $\varphi$ between Verma modules. It turned out that, surprisingly, Cayley continuants $\mathrm{Cay}_m(x;y)$ appeared in the coefficients of one of the five families of operators that we constructed. At the end, the factorization identities of the differential operators $\mathcal{D}$ and homomorphisms $\varphi$ are also classified. Binary Krawtchouk polynomials $K_m(x;y)$ play a key role in the proof.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Given a finite abelian group $G$ and a subset $J\subset G$ with $0\in J$, let $D_{G}(J,N)$ be the maximum size of $A\subset G^{N}$ such that the difference set $A-A$ and $J^{N}$ have no non-trivial intersection. Recently, this extremal problem has been widely studied for different groups $G$ and subsets $J$. In this paper, we generalize and improve the relevant results by Alon and by Heged\H{u}s by building a bridge between this problem and cyclotomic polynomials with the help of algebraic graph theory. In particular, we construct infinitely many non-trivial families of $G$ and $J$ for which the current known upper bounds on $D_{G}(J, N)$ can be improved exponentially.</p></details>

Consequently, we are able to improve upon previous work of Pintz and provide an essentially optimal error term for some choices of the zero-free region. As an example, we show that if there are no zeros $\rho=\beta+it$ of $\zeta(s)$ with \begin{equation*} 1-\beta<\frac{1}{c(\log t)^{2/3}(\log\log t)^{1/3}}=:\eta(t), \end{equation*} then \begin{equation*} \frac{|\psi(x)-x|}{x}\ll\exp(-\omega(x))\frac{(\log x)^9}{(\log\log x)^3}, \end{equation*} where $\psi(x)$ is the Chebyshev prime-counting function, and \begin{equation*} \omega(x)=\min_{t\geq 3}\{\eta(t)\log x+\log t\}. \end{equation*} This refines the best known error term for the prime number theorem, previously given by \begin{equation*} \frac{|\psi(x)-x|}{x}\ll_{\varepsilon}\exp(-(1-\varepsilon)\omega(x)) \end{equation*} for any $\varepsilon>0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a generalized Floquet-Bloch theory for discrete torsion-free nilpotent groups by exploiting their Malcev completions. Our main result is a branching formula that relates finite-dimensional representations of a discrete nilpotent lattice to infinite-dimensional unitary representations of its simply connected nilpotent Lie group. This generalization enables to extend the following two classical asymptotic problems (i) a Chebotarev density analogue for prime closed geodesics on compact negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent covers, and (ii) long time asymptotic expansions of heat kernels on such coverings to the nilpotent setting. As a by-product, we derive a semi-classical expansion for the Harper operator, presenting an alternative to mathematical justification of Wilkinson's formula by Helffer-Sj\"ostrand. We conclude by proposing several avenues for future work: extensions to general hyperbolic flows and noncompact manifolds (in particular knot complements and related quasi-morphisms), connections to modified Riemann-Hilbert problems and opers. Furthermore, we give a brief comment on asymptotic behavior of knot invariants and infinite extensions in number theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the Beurling Nyman (BN) family $f_\theta(x) = \{\theta/x\} - \theta\{1/x\}$ in $L^2((0,1])$ through a multiscale ladder parameterisation $\theta_{j,k} = 2^{-j}3^{-k}$ and the associated Gram matrix structure indexed by ladder distance. Using Mellin analysis and a controlled smoothing operator, we establish a rigorous polynomial decay envelope for off-diagonal Gram entries. Specifically, for a Gaussian-type Mellin multiplier we prove that $$|\langle g_{\theta_{j,k}}, g_{\theta_{j',k'}} \rangle| \ll_m \bigl(1 + c d((j,k),(j',k'))\bigr)^{-m}$$ for any $m$ in $\mathbb{N}$, where $c = \min\{\log 2, \log 3\}$ and $d$ denotes the ladder distance. As a consequence we obtain block-compressibility of Gram rows for $m > 2$. These results provide a rigorous foundation for sparsity phenomena in the BN system and support constructive spectral approaches. The analysis is unconditional and independent of any hypothesis concerning the zeros of the zeta function.</p></details>

Earlier results of Chevyrev-Galbraith and Goren-Love have shown that the successive minima of the Gross lattice of $\mathscr{O}$ characterize the isomorphism class of $\mathscr{O}$. In this paper, we refine and extend this work and show that the value of the third successive minimum $D_3$ of the Gross lattice gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the curve to have its $j$-invariant in the field $\mathbb{F}_p$ or in the set $\mathbb{F}_{p^2} \setminus \mathbb{F}_p$, as well as finer information about the endomorphism ring of $E$ when its $j$-invariant belongs to $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$. Finally, in the case where $j(E)$ belongs to $\mathbb{F}_p$, we define a new invariant of the Gross lattice, the Gram matrix of a normalized successive minimal basis, and develop an algorithm to compute it explicitly given the value of the first successive minimum of the Gross lattice.</p></details>

We provide another instance of the theory and prove that the stable primitivity rank, too, can be expressed in terms of stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements of groups. We introduce concrete formulas for stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements in the symmetric group $S_N$ and its generalizations in the form of the wreath products $G\wr S_N$ where $G$ is an arbitrary compact group. We also define new stable invariants related to these groups, and prove they give bounds to many of the stable Fourier coefficients.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $w$ be a word in a free group. A few years ago, Magee and the first named author discovered that the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices [arXiv:1802.04862]. But the random-matrix side of this equality can be naturally tweaked by considering $w$-random permutations, $w$-random orthogonal matrices and so on, to produce new invariants for any given word. Are these invariants new? interesting? Do they admit an intrinsic topological description as in the case of $w$-random unitaries and scl? The current paper formalizes the definition of these invariants coming from $w$-random matrices, answers the above questions in certain cases involving generalized symmetric groups, and poses detailed conjectures in many others. In particular, we present a plethora of topological, combinatorial and algebraic invariants of words which play, or are at least conjectured to play, a similar role to the one played by scl in the above-mentioned result.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Zamolodchikov periodicity is a property of certain discrete dynamical systems related to bipartite cluster algebras. It was first observed by Zamolodchikov in his study of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, initially for simply-laced Dynkin diagrams. It was proved by Keller to hold for tensor products of two Dynkin diagrams, and further shown by Galashin and Pylyavskyy to hold for pairs of commuting simply-laced Cartan matrices of finite type, which Stembridge classified in his study of admissible $W$-cells. We prove that the Zamolodchikov periodic cluster algebras are in bijection with pairs of commuting (not necessarily reduced or simply-laced) Cartan matrices of finite type. We fully classify all such pairs into 29 infinite families and 14 exceptional types in addition to the 6 infinite families and 11 exceptional types in Stembridge's classification, and show that all of these families can be derived from simply-laced types through folding and transpose. Finally, we find that these pairs are in 1-to-4 correspondence with nonnegative $W$-cells for products of two dihedral groups $W = I_2(p)\times I_2(q)$, which encode the action of the standard generators on the Kazhdan--Lusztig basis of the associated Iwahori--Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(W)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This work solves a 28-year conjecture by showing that two major invariants of smooth 4-manifolds, the shadow model (motivated by statistical mechanics [Tur91]) and the simplicial Crane-Yetter model (motivated by topological quantum field theory [CY93]), are in fact equal. These invariants, both of which degenerate to the 3D Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev model in a special case, had been open for years to clarify their relationship. Despite the seeming difference in their origins and formal constructions, we prove their equivalence. Along the way, we sketch a dictionary between the two models, provide a brief survey of the shadow construction \`a la Turaev, and suggest once again that the semisimple models have reached their limits.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>He, Lee, Oliver, and Pozdnyakov~\cite{HLOP} have empirically observed that the average of the $p$th coefficients of the $L$-functions of elliptic curves of particular ranks in a given range of conductors $N$ appears to approximate a continuous function of $p$, depending primarily on the parity of the rank. Hence the sum of $p$th coefficients against the root number also appears to approximate a continuous function, dubbed the murmuration density. However, it is not clear from this numerical data how to obtain an explicit formula for the murmuration density. Convergence of similar averages was proved by Zubrilina~\cite{Zubrilina} for modular forms of weight $2$ (of which elliptic curves form a thin subset) and analogous results for other families of automorphic forms have been obtained in further work~\cite{BBLLD,LOP}. Each of these works gives an explicit formula for the murmuration density. We consider a variant problem where the elliptic curves are ordered by naive height, and the $p$th coefficients are averaged over $p/N$ in a fixed interval. We give a conjecture for the murmuration density in this case, as an explicit but complicated sum of Bessel functions. This conjecture is motivated by a theorem about a variant problem where we sum the $n$th coefficients for $n$ with no small prime factors against a smooth weight function. We test this conjecture for elliptic curves of naive height up to $2^{28}$ and find good agreement with the data. The theorem is proved using the Voronoi summation formula, and the method should apply to many different families of $L$-functions. By a similar approach, we give a prediction murmuration density for elliptic curves of prime conductor, ordered by conductor, again matching the data but lacking a motivating theorem. This is the first work to give an explicit formula for the murmuration density of a family of elliptic curves, in any ordering.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the rational points on certain members of the following family of hyperelliptic curves $$C_a \colon y^2 = x^8 + (4-4a^4) x^6 + (8a^4 + 6)x^4 + (4-4a^4)x^2 + 1$$ via the method first developed by Dem'yanenko \cite{dem1966rational} and then further generalized by Manin \cite{manin1969p}. In particular, we show that the method of Chabauty--Coleman, while applicable to certain members of this family, is not the most efficient way of computing $C_a(\mathbb{Q})$. We adapt the approach of \cite{kulesz1999application}, incorporating root numbers to further restrict the possible ranks of the elliptic curves arising in the Jacobian decomposition.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The "pyjama stripe" with parameter $\varepsilon>0$ is the set $E(\varepsilon)$ of all complex numbers $z$ such that the distance from $\Re(z)$ to the nearest integer is at most $\varepsilon$. The Pyjama Problem of Iosevich, Kolountzakis, and Matolcsi asks whether, for every choice of $\varepsilon>0$, it is possible to cover the entire complex plane with finitely many rotations of $E(\varepsilon)$ around the origin. Manners obtained an affirmative answer to this question by studying a $\times 2, \times 3$-type problem over a suitable solenoid. Manners's argument provided no quantitative bounds (in terms of $\varepsilon$) on the number of rotations required, and Green has highlighted the problem of obtaining such quantitative bounds. Our main result is that $\exp\exp\exp(\varepsilon^{-O(1)})$ rotations of $E(\varepsilon)$ suffice to cover the complex plane. Our analysis makes use of the entropic tools developed by Bourgain, Lindenstrauss, Michel, and Venkatesh for quantitative $\times 2, \times 3$-type results.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E$ be an elliptic curve having CM by the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic field $K$ in which $p$ splits. Following Lichtenbaum, the Bernoulli--Hurwitz numbers of $E$ (i.e., values of Eisenstein series evaluated at $E$ up to normalization) admit integral representations given by a $p$-adic measure constructed from an elliptic function. We show that the periods of this measure are in fact special values of a family of weight one Eisenstein series at the CM curve $E$ equipped with certain level data, and explicitly relate it to Katz's one-variable $p$-adic Eisenstein measure, whereby we derive period formulas of the Bernoulli--Hurwitz measure attached to any ordinary elliptic curve $\mathcal{E}$ defined over a local field. Moreover, by exploiting the modularity of these periods, and thanks to the existence of abundant weight one Hasse-type invariants, we present a novel approach to the interpolation property of the Bernoulli--Hurwitz $p$-adic zeta functions of the ordinary elliptic curve $\mathcal{E}$, and obtain a $p$-adic Kronecker's first limit formula.</p></details>

We call such numbers transcendentally normal. We prove that almost every real number is transcendentally normal and provide an explicit construction of such a number, based on Sierpinski's covering method and novel ideas involving the so-called stretch function. In the next step, we transform this construction into an algorithm that computes the digits of a t-normal number recursively in all integer bases. Moreover, we extend our covering approach to construct and compute LIL-normal numbers whose discrepancies are of the order predicted by the law of the iterated logarithm. We also take the opportunity to discuss several interesting open problems.</p></details>

One can extend $\psi$ to a continuous non-Hecke character on the idele group of a number field. For $|\alpha|<1$, the resulting $\psi$-twisted $L$-function has interesting analytic properties: an enhanced half-plane of absolute convergence, preservation of the Euler product structure, and meromorphic continuation to the complex plane. We give applications to Dirichlet $L$-functions and $L$-functions associated to modular forms. Furthermore, we show that $\psi$-twisting allows the construction of convergent $p$-adic Dirichlet series and $p$-adic Euler products which have some similarities with their complex counterparts.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We develop a theory of Hopf BiGalois extensions for Hopf algebroids. We understand these to be left bialgebroids (whose left module categories are monoidal categories) fulfilling a condition that is equivalent to being Hopf in the case of ordinary bialgebras, but does not entail the existence of an antipode map. The immediate obstacle to developing a full biGalois theory for such Hopf algebroids is simple: The condition to be a left Hopf Galois extension can be defined in complete analogy to the Hopf case, but the Galois map for a right comodule algebra is not a well defined map. We find that this obstacle can be circumvented using bialgebroids fulfilling a condition that still does not entail the existence of an antipode, but is equivalent, for ordinary bialgebras, to being Hopf with bijective antipode. The key technical tool is a result of Chemla allowing to switch left and right comodule structures under flatness conditions much like one would do using an antipode. Using this, we arrive at a left-right symmetric theory of biGalois extensions, including the construction of an Ehresmann Hopf algebroid making a one-sided Hopf-Galois extension into a biGalois one. Moreover, we apply a more general 2-cocycle twist theory to Ehresmann Hopf algebroids. As the 2-cocycle is only left linear over the base, the base algebra is also twisted. We also study the Ehresmann Hopf algebroids of quantum Hopf fibrations and quantum homogeneous space as examples.</p></details>

In this article, we consider self-similar sets whose iterated function systems satisfy the open set condition. For functions $\psi$ that do not decrease too rapidly, we give a conjecturally sharp upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection of $\psi$-well approximable numbers and such self-similar sets. When $\psi=\psi_v$ for some $v$ greater than 1 and sufficiently close to $1$, we give a lower bound for this Hausdorff dimension, which asymptotically matches the upper bound as $v\downarrow 1$. In particular, we show that the set of very well approximable numbers has full Hausdorff dimension within self-similar sets, thus confirming a conjecture of Levesley, Salp, and Velani.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give first-order definitions of Campana and Darmon points in algebraic function fields in one variable over number fields. These sets are geometric generalizations of $n$-full integers (integers whose nonzero valuations are at least $n$) and perfect $n$th powers, respectively, to more general algebraic varieties. For this we exploit the theory of quadratic Pfister forms, which were used by Becher, Daans & Dittmann to extend to the case of algebraic function fields in one variable the methods used by Koenigsmann when proving that $\mathbb{Z}$ is universally defined in $\mathbb{Q}$. These methods had already been generalized to arbitrary global fields by Park (2013) and Eisentr\"ager & Morrison (2018), and the author had already exploited these methods to find first-order definitions of Campana points (2024) and Darmon points (2024, with Handley) in the context of number fields. With the newly expanded version of these methods, we now transfer those results to the new context of algebraic function fields in one variable over number fields.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we construct an arithmetic hyperbolic $6-$orbifold $\mathcal{O}$ such that, any square-rootable Salem number of degree at most $4$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is realized as the exponential of the length of a closed geodesic in $\mathcal{O}$. We also prove that $n=6$ is the minimal dimension among arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds of the first type where it can be obtained. In an appendix, we establish a general relation between the discriminant of a Salem number and the determinant of a quadratic space which realizes it. In particular, for any $m,d>0$ we present a geometric proof of the existence of Salem numbers of degree $2m$ with discriminant $(-1)^{m+1}d$ in $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}/\mathbb{Q}^{\times 2}$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper we study the category of localizing motives $\mathrm{Mot}^{\mathrm{loc}}$ -- the target of the universal finitary localizing invariant of idempotent-complete stable categories as defined by Blumberg-Gepner-Tabuada. We prove that this (presentable stable) category is rigid symmetric monoidal in the sense of Gaitsgory and Rozenblyum. In particular, it is dualizable. More precisely, we prove a more general version of this result for the category $\mathrm{Mot}^{\mathrm{loc}}_{\mathcal{E}}$ -- the target of the universal finitary localizing invariant of dualizable modules over a rigid symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{E}.$ We obtain general results on morphisms and internal $\mathrm{Hom}$ in the categories $\mathrm{Mot}^{\mathrm{loc}}_{\mathcal{E}}$ of localizing motives. As an application we compute the morphisms in multiple non-trivial examples. In particular, we prove the corepresentability statements for $\mathrm{TR}$ (topological restriction) and $\mathrm{TC}$ (topological cyclic homology) when restricted to connective $\mathbb{E}_1$-rings. As a corollary, for a connective $\mathbb{E}_{\infty}$-ring $R$ we obtain a $\mathrm{TR}(R)$-module structure on the nil $K$-theory spectrum $NK(R).$ We also apply the rigidity theorem to define refined versions of negative cyclic homology and periodic cyclic homology. This was announced previously in \cite{E24b}, and certain very interesting examples were computed by Meyer and Wagner in \cite{MW24}. Here we do several computations in characteristic $0,$ in particular showing that in seemingly innocuous situations the answer can be given by an interesting algebra of overconvergent functions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Here, we establish a polynomial identity in three variables $a, b, c$, and with the degree of the polynomial given in terms of two integers $L, M$. By letting $L$ and $M$ tend to infinity, we get the 1993 Alladi-Gordon $q$-hypergeometric key-identity for the generalized Schur Theorem as well as the fundamental Lebesgue identity by two different choices of the variables. This polynomial identity provides a generalization and a unified approach to the Schur and Lebesgue theorems. We discuss other analytic identities for the Lebesgue and Schur theorems and also provide a key identity ($q$-hypergeometric) for Andrews' deep refinement of the Alladi-Schur theorem. Finally, we discuss a new infinite hierarchy of identities, the first three of which relate to the partition theorems of Euler, Lebesgue, and Capparelli, and provide their polynomial versions as well.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We explain how the geometric framework introduced in arXiv:2508.11621 [math.AG] provides a universal property for the 2-rings of perfect complexes on qcqs spectral or Dirac spectral schemes. As an application, given a qcqs spectral or Dirac spectral scheme $X$ this produces a comparison morphism from $\mathrm{Spec} \mathrm{Perf}_{X}$ to $X$ itself, which is moreover natural in $X$. When $X$ is an ordinary qcqs scheme, this construction supplies a new proof of the Balmer-Thomason reconstruction of $X$ from its space of thick subcategories, assuming the result for noetherian rings due to Neeman. As another application, we find spectral and Dirac spectral enhancements of support varieties arising for 2-rings in representation theory which "geometrize" the 2-rings that produce them. For example, given a finite group $G$ over a field $k$, this produces a "spectral support variety" $\mathcal{V}_{G}$ such that $\mathrm{Perf}_{\mathcal{V}_{G}}$ maps into the stable module category of $kG$. We derive these results as a corollary of a general affineness criterion for 2-schemes which are covered by the Zariski spectra of rigid 2-rings: this states that such 2-schemes are affine if and only if they are quasicompact and quasiseparated.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $d \ge 2$ be an integer, $K$ an algebraically closed field such that $char(K)$ does not divide $d$, $n > d$ an integer prime to $d$, $f(x)$ a degree $n$ monic polynomial with coefficients in $K$ and without repeated roots, and $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ a smooth projective model of the affine curve $y^d=f(x)$. Let $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$ be the Jacobian of $\mathcal{C}_{f,d} $. We identify $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ with its canonical image in $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$ (such that the infinite point of $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ goes to the zero of the group law on $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$). We say that an integer $m>1$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K$ if there exists a polynomial $f(x)$ as above such that $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}(K)$ contains a torsion point of order $m$. Earlier we proved that if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable, then either $m=d$ or $m \geq n$ (in addition, both $d$ and $n$ are $(n,d)$-reachable). In the present paper we prove the following. If $n<m<2n$ and if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K$, then either $d|m$ or $m$ is congruent to $n$ modulo $d$. If $char(K)$ is $0$ or $>n$, then $d [(n+d)/d]$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if and only if $n-(d-1) [(n+d)/d]\ge 0$. If $char(K)=0$, then $n+d$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if and only if $d^2-2d<n$. If $d=2$ (the hyperelliptic case) and $char(K)=0$, then $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if $n+1 \le m \le 2n+1$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the phenomenon known as ``quantum equals affine'' in the setting of $T$-equivariant quantum $K$-theory of the flag variety $G/B$, as established by Kato for any semisimple algebraic group $G$. In particular, we focus on the $K$-Peterson isomorphism between the $T$-equivariant quantum $K$-ring $QK_T(SL_n(\mathbb{C})/B)$ and the $T$-equivariant $K$-homology ring $K_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_{SL_n})$ of the affine Grassmannian, after suitable localizations on both sides. Building on an earlier work by Ikeda, Iwao, and Maeno, we present an explicit algebraic realization of the $K$-Peterson map via a rational substitution that sends the generators of the quantum $K$-theory ring to explicit rational expressions in the fundamental generators of $K_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_{SL_n})$, thereby matching the Schubert bases on both sides. Our approach builds on recent developments in the theory of $QK_T(SL_n(\mathbb{C})/B)$ by Maeno, Naito, and Sagaki, as well as the theory of $K$-theoretic double $k$-Schur functions introduced by Ikeda, Shimozono, and Yamaguchi. This concrete formulation provides new insight into the combinatorial structure of the $K$-Peterson isomorphism in the equivariant setting. As an application, we establish a factorization formula for the $K$-theoretic double $k$-Schur function associated with the maximal $k$-irreducible $k$-bounded partition.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Witt algebra W_n is the Lie algebra of all derivations of the n-variable polynomial ring V_n=C[x_1, ..., x_n] (or of algebraic vector fields on A^n). A representation of W_n is polynomial if it arises as a subquotient of a sum of tensor powers of V_n. Our main theorems assert that finitely generated polynomial representations of W_n are noetherian and have rational Hilbert series. A key intermediate result states polynomial representations of the infinite Witt algebra are equivalent to representations of Fin^op, where Fin is the category of finite sets. We also show that polynomial representations of W_n are equivalent to polynomial representations of the endomorphism monoid of A^n. These equivalences are a special case of an operadic version of Schur--Weyl duality, which we establish.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $A$ be a commutative algebra in a braided monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$; e.g., $A$ could be an extension of a vertex operator algebra (VOA) $V$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ of $V$-modules. We study when the category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ and its subcategory $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ of local modules inherit rigidity from $\mathcal{C}$, and then we find conditions for $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{C}_A$ to inherit rigidity from $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$. First, we assume $\mathcal{C}$ is a braided finite tensor category and prove rigidity of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ under conditions based on criteria of Etingof-Ostrik for $A$ to be an exact algebra in $\mathcal{C}$. As a corollary, we show that if $A$ is a simple $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$-graded VOA with a strongly rational vertex operator subalgebra $V$, then $A$ is strongly rational, without requiring the categorical dimension of $A$ as a $V$-module to be non-zero. Next, we assume $\mathcal{C}$ is a Grothendieck-Verdier category, i.e., $\mathcal{C}$ admits a weaker duality structure than rigidity. We first prove $\mathcal{C}_A$ is also a Grothendieck-Verdier category. Using this, we prove that if $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ is rigid, then so is $\mathcal{C}$ under conditions such as a mild non-degeneracy assumption on $\mathcal{C}$, an assumption that every simple object of $\mathcal{C}_A$ is local, and that induction from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{C}_A$ commutes with duality. These conditions are motivated by free field-like VOA extensions $V\subseteq A$ where $A$ is often an indecomposable $V$-module, so our result will make it more feasible to prove rigidity for many vertex algebraic monoidal categories. In a follow-up work, our result will be used to prove rigidity of the category of weight modules for the simple affine VOA of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at any admissible level.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study the set of $D$ such that a given irreducible hypersurface $C$ of degree $d$ has infinitely many points of degree $D$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. We give a new explicit proof that this set contains all (positive) multiples of the index of $C$ with finitely many exceptions. When $D$ is sufficiently large and divisible by the index of $C$, we show there are $\gg x^{1/2d^2-\epsilon}$ distinct fields with degree $D$ and discriminant $\leq x$ containing new non-singular points on $C$. Our proof relies on (what we define to be) the index of the Newton polytope $H(C)$ for $C$ which we use as combinatorial proxy for the index of $C$. We conjecture that for almost all $C$ with a given Newton polytope $H$, the index of $H$ equals the index of $C$ and we prove this conjecture for a positive proportion of curves with $H(C)=H$. As an application of our techniques, we prove half of Bhargava's conjecture on the least odd degree of points on a typical hyperelliptic and we recover Springer's theorem and a related statement for rational points on cubic hypersurfaces.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Littlewood-Richardson, Kronecker and plethysm coefficients are fundamental multiplicities of interest in Representation Theory and Algebraic Combinatorics. Determining a combinatorial interpretation for the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients is a major open problem, and prompts the consideration of their computational complexity. Recently it was shown that they behave relatively well with respect to quantum computation, and for some large families there are polynomial time quantum algorithms [Larocca,Havlicek, arXiv:2407.17649] (also [BCGHZ,arXiv:2302.11454]). In this paper we show that for many of those cases the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients can also be computed in polynomial time via classical algorithms, thereby refuting some of the conjectures in [LH24]. This vastly limits the cases in which the desired super-polynomial quantum speedup could be achieved.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Naito--Sagaki conjecture asserts that the branching rule for the restriction of finite-dimensional, irreducible polynomial representations of $GL_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ to $Sp_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ amounts to the enumeration of certain ``rational paths'' satisfying specific conditions. This conjecture can be thought of as a non-Levi type analog of the Levi type branching rule, stated in terms of the path model due to Littelmann, and was proved combinatorially in 2018 by Schumann--Torres. In this paper, we give a new proof of the Naito--Sagaki conjecture independently of Schumann--Torres, using the branching rule based on the crystal basis theory for $\imath$quantum groups of type $\mathrm{AII}_{2n-1}$. Here, note that $\imath$quantum groups are certain coideal subalgebras of a quantized universal enveloping algebra obtained by $q$-deforming symmetric pairs, and also regarded as a generalization of quantized universal enveloping algebras; these were defined by Letzter in 1999, and since then their representation theory has become an active area of research. The main ingredients of our approach are certain combinatorial operations, such as promotion operators and Kashiwara operators, which are well-suited to the representation theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is the first paper in a series where we study arithmetic applications of the multiple elliptic Gamma functions originated from theoretical physics. The main purpose of this paper is the introduction of a framework for applications of these functions to Hilbert's 12th problem for general number fields with exactly one complex place following recent work by Bergeron, Charollois and Garc\'ia. Namely, we define geometric families of the multiple elliptic Gamma functions, upgrading the construction carried out by Felder, Henriques, Rossi and Zhu for rank $3$ lattices to lattices of higher ranks. These functions enjoy transformation properties under an action of the special linear group $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ for $n \geq 2$ involving some Bernoulli rational functions as their so-called modularity defect. A second purpose of this paper is to use this collection of Bernoulli rational functions to construct $(n-1)$-cocycles for specific subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ associated to units groups in totally real number fields and use these cocycles to compute partial zeta values at $s=0$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The cyclic product of an arbitrary number of Szeg\"o kernels for even spin structure $\delta$ on a compact higher-genus Riemann surface $\Sigma$ may be decomposed via a descent procedure which systematically separates the dependence on the points $z_i \in \Sigma$ from the dependence on the spin structure $\delta$. In this paper, we prove two different, but complementary, descent procedures to achieve this decomposition. In the first procedure, the dependence on the points $z_i \in \Sigma$ is expressed via the meromorphic multiple-valued Enriquez kernels of e-print 1112.0864 while the dependence on $\delta$ resides in multiplets of functions that are independent of $z_i$, locally holomorphic in the moduli of $\Sigma$ and generally do not have simple modular transformation properties. The $\delta$-dependent constants are expressed as multiple convolution integrals over homology cycles of $\Sigma$, thereby generalizing a similar representation of the individual Enriquez kernels. In the second procedure, which was proposed without proof in e-print 2308.05044, the dependence on $z_i$ is expressed in terms the single-valued, modular invariant, but non-meromorphic DHS kernels introduced in e-print 2306.08644 while the dependence on $\delta$ resides in modular tensors that are independent of $z_i$ and are generally non-holomorphic in the moduli of $\Sigma$. Although the individual building blocks of these decompositions have markedly different properties, we show that the combinatorial structure of the two decompositions is virtually identical, thereby extending the striking correspondence observed earlier between the roles played by Enriquez and DHS kernels. Both decompositions are further generalized to the case of linear chain products of Szeg\"o kernels.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Recently left Schur subcategories in a length abelian category were introduced by Enomoto, which unify torsion-free classes and wide subcategories. In this paper, we show the construction of left Schur subcategories in the recollements of length abelian categories. Moreover, we show the construction restricts to wide subcategories and torsion-free classes. As an application, we give an explicit construction of cofinally closed monobricks in recollements.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 23 pages. The algorithm has been optimized to its fullest extent and can execute efficiently for higher degrees. Constructive comments are always welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the field of characteristic two, $\mathbb F_2.$ Denote by $GL(q)$ the general linear group of rank $q$ over $\mathbb F_2.$ The algebraic transfer, introduced by W. Singer [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523], is a rather effective tool for unraveling the intricate structure of the (mod-2) cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr A}^{q,*}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2).$ The Kameko homomorphism is one of the useful tools to study the dimension of the domain of the Singer transfer. Singer conjectured that the algebraic transfer is always a monomorphism, but this remains open in general case. In this work, by constructing a novel algorithm implemented in the computer algebra system OSCAR for computing $GL(q)$-invariants of the kernel of the Kameko homomorphism, we disprove Singer's conjecture for bidegree $(6,6+36).$</p></details>

This is applied to show that certain families of such varieties have no Brauer-Manin obstruction to the local-global principle.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y})$ be a balanced pair in an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$. Denote by ${\bf K}_{\mathcal{E}\text{-}{\rm ac}}(\mathcal{X})$ the chain homotopy category of right $\mathcal{X}$-acyclic complexes with all items in $\mathcal{X}$, and dually by ${\bf K}_{\mathcal{E}\text{-}{\rm ac}}(\mathcal{Y})$ the chain homotopy category of left $\mathcal{Y}$-acyclic complexes with all items in $\mathcal{Y}$. We establish realizations of ${\bf K}_{\mathcal{E}\text{-}{\rm ac}}(\mathcal{X})$ and ${\bf K}_{\mathcal{E}\text{-}{\rm ac}}(\mathcal{Y})$ as homotopy categories of model categories under mild conditions. Consequently, we obtain relative versions of recollements of Krause and Neeman-Murfet. We further give applications to Gorenstein projective and Gorenstein injective modules.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 7 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We analyze algorithms for computing the $n$th prime $p_n$ and establish asymptotic bounds for several approaches. Using existing results on the complexity of evaluating the prime-counting function $\pi(x)$, we show that the binary search approach computes $p_n$ in $O(\sqrt{n} \, (\log n)^4)$ time. Assuming the Riemann Hypothesis and Cram\'er's conjecture, we construct a tighter interval around li$^{-1}(n)$, leading to an improved sieve-based algorithm running in $O(\sqrt{n} \, (\log ^{7/2} n) \, \log \log n)$ time. This improvement, though conditional, suggests that further refinements to prime gap estimates may yield provably faster methods for computing primes.</p></details>

We also compute the maximal dimension of these polytopes and give new proofs of some known results of more theoretical nature.</p></details>
