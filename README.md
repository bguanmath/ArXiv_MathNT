 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-07-31 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Arash Arabi Ardehali, Christopher Beem, Madalena Lemos, Leonardo Rastelli &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** hep-th &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Vertex algebras that arise from four-dimensional, $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories inherit a collection of novel structural properties from their four-dimensional ancestors. Crucially, when the parent SCFT is unitary, the corresponding vertex algebra is not unitary in the conventional sense. In this paper, we motivate and define a generalized notion of unitarity for vertex algebras that we call \emph{graded unitarity}, and which captures the consequences of four-dimensional unitarity under this correspondence. We also take the first steps towards a classification program for graded-unitary vertex algebras whose underlying vertex algebras are Virasoro or affine Kac--Moody vertex algebras. Remarkably, under certain natural assumptions about the $\mathfrak{R}$-filtration for these vertex algebras, we show that only the $(2,p)$ central charges for Virasoro VOAs and boundary admissible levels for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ Kac--Moody vertex algebras can possibly be compatible with graded unitarity. These are precisely the cases of these vertex algebras that are known to arise from four dimensions.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 54 Pages, 5 figures. We study a new set of dominant weights over Borcherds-Kac-Moody algebras, to obtain weights of any highest weight module V; and explore characters of the associated simples. Added Theorem D on characters of all V (including simples) with top weights Weyl vectors, in a negative type A setting

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fix any Borcherds-Kac-Moody $\mathbb{C}$-Lie algebra (BKM LA) $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{g}(A)$ of BKM-Cartan matrix $A$, and Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}\subset \mathfrak{g}$. In this paper, we obtain explicit weight formulas of any highest weight $\mathfrak{g}$-module $V$ with top weight $\lambda\in \mathfrak{h}^*$ : 1) Generalizing and extending those in one stroke from Kac-Moody (KM) case, of simples $V=L(\lambda)$ by Khare [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 2017] and Dhillon-Khare [Adv. Math. 2017 \& J. Algebra. 2022] and recently of all $V$ by Khare-Teja; via parabolic and higher order Verma $V$. 2) Uniform for all $(\mathfrak{g}, \lambda, V)$; seemingly novel even for integrable ($L(\lambda)$ and all intermediate) $V$ for dominant integral $\lambda\in P^+$. 3) As Weyl-orbit formulas (of finite-dim. $L(\lambda)$s) for several $V$; and for our candidates of parabolic Vermas over BKM LAs. 4) Using our concepts of holes (1-dim. weight-spaces lost) in $V$, and $P^{\pm}$-dominant weights to cover Chevalley-Serre relations in generic simple $V$s. We define $P^{\pm}$ to be the set of $\mu\in \mathfrak{h}^*$ paired with simple co-roots for $A_{ii}\geq 0$ as usual, but notably by negative multiples of $\frac{|A_{ii}|}{2}$ if $A_{ii}<0$. By-products of working with $P^{\pm}$: study of simples $L(\lambda)\ \forall\ \lambda\in P^{\pm}$, notably of $L(\rho)$ for Weyl vectors $\rho\in P^{\pm} \setminus P^+$, and their Verma covers; all novel to our best knowledge. For Weyl-Kac-Borcherds character type formulas of these $L(\lambda)$s over negative rank-2 $\mathfrak{g}$ and of $L(\rho)$ over negative $A_n$ type $\mathfrak{g}$ $\forall$ $n\in \mathbb{N}$, we explore : i) their presentations; ii) their Verma modules' structures; iii) problems on maximal vectors or Verma embeddings, from Kac-Kazhdan [Adv. Math. 1979], for our BKM $P^{\pm}$ setting.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages. Preliminary version, comments welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper addresses the interactions between three properties that a group algebra or more generally a pointed Hopf algebra may possess: being noetherian, having finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, and satisfying the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence. First it is shown that the second and third of these properties are equivalent for group algebras $kG$ of polycyclic-by-finite groups, and are, in turn, equivalent to $G$ being nilpotent-by-finite. In characteristic 0, this enables us to extend this equivalence to certain cocommutative Hopf algebras. In the second and third parts of the paper finiteness conditions for group algebras are studied. In the second section we examine when a group algebra satisfies the Goldie conditions, while in the final section we discuss what can be said about a minimal counterexample to the conjecture that if $kG$ is noetherian then G is polycyclic-by-finite.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This is a paper in smooth $4$-manifold topology, inspired by the N\'{e}ron-Lang Theorem in number theory. More precisely, we prove that a smooth version $\MW(\pi)$ of Mordell-Weil group of an elliptic fibration $\pi:M\to\Pb^1$ is finitely generated. We compute $\MW(\pi_d)$ explicitly for elliptic fibrations $\pi_d:M_d\to\Pb^1$, where $M_d$ is a simply-connected complex surfaces $M_d$ of arithmetic genus $d\geq 1$ and all fibers of $\pi_d$ are nodal. We prove in this case that the fibered structure is unique up topological isotopy. By combining this with a result of Donaldson, we obtain the following remarkable consequence: any diffeomorphism of $M_d$ with $d\geq 3$ is topologically isotopic to a diffeomorphism taking fibers to fibers.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 20 pages, amended according to reviewers' suggestions (main theorem of Section 4 proved for semiprimary rings instead of bound quiver algebras), comments are welcome

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We introduce the notion of radical preservation and prove that a radical-preserving homomorphism of left artinian rings of finite projective dimension with superfluous kernel reflects the finiteness of the little finitistic, big finitistic and global dimension. As an application, we prove that every bound quiver algebra with quasi-uniform Loewy length, a class of algebras introduced in this paper, has finite (big) finitistic dimension. The same result holds more generally in the context of semiprimary rings. Moreover, we construct an explicit family of such finite dimensional algebras where the finiteness of their big finitistic dimension does not follow from existing results in the literature.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F_h(n)$ denote the minimum cardinality of an additive {\em $h$-fold basis} of $\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$: a set $S$ such that any integer in $\{1,2,\cdots, n\}$ can be written as a sum of at most $h$ elements from $S$. While the trivial bounds $h!n \; \lesssim \; F_h(n)^h \; \lesssim \; h^h n$ are well-known, comparatively little has been established for $h>2$. In this paper, we make significant improvements to both of the best-known bounds on $F_h(n)$ for sufficiently large $h$. For the lower bound, we use a probabilistic approach along with the Berry-Esseen Theorem to improve upon the best-known asymptotic result due to Yu. We also establish the first nontrivial asymptotic upper bound on $F_h(n)$ by leveraging a construction for additive bases of finite cyclic groups due to Jia and Shen. In particular, we show that given any $\epsilon>0$, for sufficiently large $h$, we have $$ \left(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon\right)h!\sqrt{2\pi e} n\; \leq \; F_h(n)^h \; \leq \; \left(\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+\epsilon\right)h\right)^h n. $$</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let ${\pmb b}=\{b_0,\,b_1,\,\ldots\}$ be the known sequence of numbers such that $b_0\neq0$. In this work, we develop methods to find another sequence ${\pmb a}=\{a_0,\,a_1,\,\ldots\}$ that is related to ${\pmb b}$ as follows: $a_n=a_0\,b_{n+m}+a_1\,b_{n+m-1}+\ldots+a_{n+m}\,b_0$, $n\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$, $m\in\mathbb{N}$. We show the connection of $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n$ with $a_0,\,a_1,\,\ldots,\,a_{m-1}$ and provide varied examples of finding the sequence ${\pmb a}$ when ${\pmb b}$ is given. We demonstrate that the sequences ${\pmb a}$ may exhibit pretty patterns in the plane or space. Also, we show that the properly chosen sequence ${\pmb b}$ may define ${\pmb a}$ as some famous sequences, such as the partial sums of the Riemann zeta function, etc.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 22 pages. v2: enhanced introduction. v3: final version, to appear in Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbf{P}_{2n+2}$ be the regular polygon with $2n+2$ vertices, and let $\theta$ be the rotation of 180$^\circ$. Fomin and Zelevinsky proved that $\theta$-invariant triangulations of $\mathbf{P}_{2n+2}$ are in bijection with the clusters of cluster algebras of type $B_n$ or $C_n$. Furthermore, cluster variables correspond to the orbits of the action of $\theta$ on the diagonals of $\mathbf{P}_{2n+2}$. In this paper, we associate a labeled modified snake graph $\mathcal{G}_{ab}$ to each $\theta$-orbit $[a,b]$, and we get the cluster variables of type $B_n$ and $C_n$ which correspond to $[a,b]$ as perfect matching Laurent polynomials of $\mathcal{G}_{ab}$. This extends the work of Musiker for cluster algebras of type B and C to every seed.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 11 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The purpose of this note is to prove a conjecture of Shvartsman relating a complex projective reflection group with the quotient of a suitable complex braid group by its center. Shvartsman originally proved this result in the case of real projective reflection groups, and we extend it to all complex projective reflection groups. Our study also allows us to correct a result of Brou\'e, Malle, Rouquier on projective reflection groups.</p></details>

> **Comment:** We extended our counter-example to the converse theorem for $SO(6)$ to $SO(2n)$ whenever $n\geq 3$

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $F$ be a non Archimedean local field, and $G$ be the $F$-points of a connected quasi-split reductive group defined over $F$. In this note we propose a converse theorem statement for generic Langlands parameters of $G$ when the Langlands dual group of $G$ is acceptable. We then prove it when $G$ is $F$-split. We also prove that the statement does not apply to $\mathrm{SO}_{2n}(F)$ for certain choices of $F$, as soon as $n\geq 3$.Then we consider a variant which we prove for $G=\mathrm{G}_2(F)$ and all quasi-split classical groups. When $F$ has characteristic zero and assuming the validity of the Gross-Prasad and Rallis conjecture, this latter variant translates via the generic local Langlands correspondence of Jantzen and Liu, into the usual local converse theorems for classical groups expressed in terms of Shahidi's gamma factors.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 19 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that the $p$-part of the degree of an irreducible character of a symmetric group is completely determined by the set of vanishing elements of $p$-power order. As a corollary we deduce that the set of zeros of prime power order controls the degree of such a character. The same problem is analysed for alternating groups, where we show that when $p=2$ this data can only be determined up to two possibilities. We prove analogous statements for the defect of the $p$-block containing the character and for the $p$-height of the character.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 9 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There exist numerous results in the literature proving that within certain families of totally real number fields, the minimal rank of a universal quadratic lattice over such a field can be arbitrarily large. Kala introduced a technique of extending such results to larger fields -- e.g. from quadratic fields to fields of arbitrary even degree -- under some conditions. We present improvements to this technique by investigating the structure of subfields within composita of number fields, using basic Galois theory to translate this into a group-theoretic problem. In particular, we show that if totally real number fields with minimal rank of a universal lattice $\geq r$ exist in degree $d$, then they also exist in degree $kd$ for all $k\geq3$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Revised and extended

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For certain symmetric isogeny $\lambda: A\rightarrow A^\vee$ of abelian varieties over a global field $F$, B. Poonen and E. Rains put an orthogonal quadratic structure on $\mathrm{H}^1(\mathbb{A}_F,A[\lambda])$ and realize the Selmer group $\mathrm{Sel}_\lambda(A)$ as an intersection of two maximal isotropic subspaces of $\mathrm{H}^1(\mathbb{A}_F,A[\lambda])$. With this understanding of Selmer groups, they expect to model the Selmer groups of elliptic curves and Jacobian varieties of hyperelliptic curves as the intersections of random maximal isotropic subspaces of orthogonal spaces. We extend this phenomenon to abelian varieties with multiplication and discuss the Shafarevich-Tate groups.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the Selmer ranks in certain families of $p$-th twists of CM abelian varieties obey the symplectic or unitary distributions. As an application, for a prime $p\geq 3$, we obtain that the twisted Fermat curves $X^p+Y^p=\delta$ over a number field containing a primitive $p$-th root of unity are ``largely" unsolvable as $\delta$ varies. We also discuss the rank growth in cyclic extensions of prime degree for CM abelian varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Suppose we partition the integers into finitely many cells. Can we always find a solution of the equation $x^2+y^2=z^2$ with $x,y,z$ on the same cell? What about more general homogeneous quadratic equations in three variables? These are basic questions in arithmetic Ramsey theory, which have recently been partially answered using ideas inspired by ergodic theory and tools such as Gowers-uniformity properties and concentration estimates of bounded multiplicative functions. The aim of this article is to provide an introduction to this exciting research area, explaining the main ideas behind the recent progress and some of the important challenges that lie ahead.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $E_1$ and $E_2$ be elliptic curves over a number field $K$. In \cite{scc}, Mazur and Rubin define the concept of $n$-Selmer near-companions and conjecture that if $E_1$ and $E_2$ are $n$-Selmer near-companions over $K$, then $E_1[n]$ is $G_K$-isomorphic to $E_2[n]$. Yu proves the conjecture on $n$-Selmer near-companion curves in the case $n=2$. We we introduce the notion of $p$-twisted Selmer near-companions ($p$-TSNC) over $K$ and prove that if $E_1$ and $E_2$ are $p$-TSNC over $K$, then $K(E_1[p])=K(E_2[p])$ under certain conditions.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We construct finite $R$-matrices for the first fundamental representation $V$ of two-parameter quantum groups $U_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$ for classical $\mathfrak{g}$, both through the decomposition of $V\otimes V$ into irreducibles $U_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$-submodules as well as by evaluating the universal $R$-matrix. The latter is crucially based on the construction of dual PBW-type bases of $U^{\pm}_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$ consisting of the ordered products of quantum root vectors defined via $(r,s)$-bracketings and combinatorics of standard Lyndon words. We further derive explicit formulas for affine $R$-matrices, both through the Yang-Baxterization technique of [Internat. J. Modern Phys. A 6 (1991), 3735-3779] and as the unique intertwiner between the tensor product of $V(u)$ and $V(v)$, viewed as modules over two-parameter quantum affine algebras $U_{r,s}(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ for classical $\mathfrak{g}$. The latter generalizes the formulas of [Comm. Math. Phys. 102 (1986), 537-547] for one-parametric quantum affine algebras.</p></details>

We then show that the combinatorial complexes used by Soergel to compute these cohomology groups satisfies Serre duality. We conclude that this produces two n cohomology groups, each for a totally degenerate limit of discrete series of U(n+1) and U(n), which are nonvanishing at the same degree.

As a consequence of our results, we show that irreducible linear degenerations are normal varieties.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We investigate the densities of the sets of abundant numbers and of covering numbers, integers $n$ for which there exists a distinct covering system where every modulus divides $n$. We establish that the set $\mathcal{C}$ of covering numbers possesses a natural density $d(\mathcal{C})$ and prove that $0.103230 < d(\mathcal{C}) < 0.103398.$ Our approach adapts methods developed by Behrend and Del\'eglise for bounding the density of abundant numbers, by introducing a function $c(n)$ that measures how close an integer $n$ is to being a covering number with the property that $c(n) \leq h(n) = \sigma(n)/n$. However, computing $d(\mathcal{C})$ to three decimal digits requires some new ideas to simplify the computations. As a byproduct of our methods, we obtain significantly improved bounds for $d(\mathcal{A})$, the density of abundant numbers, namely $0.247619608 < d(\mathcal{A}) < 0.247619658$. We also show the count of primitive covering numbers up to $x$ is $O\left( x\exp\left(\left(-\tfrac{1}{2\sqrt{\log 2}} + \epsilon\right)\sqrt{\log x} \log \log x\right)\right)$, which is substantially smaller than the corresponding bound for primitive abundant numbers.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For logarithmic conformal field theories whose monodromy data is given by a not necessarily semisimple modular category, we solve the problem of constructing and classifying the consistent systems of correlators. The correlator construction given in this article generalizes the well-known one for rational conformal field theories given by Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert roughly twenty years ago and solves conjectures of Fuchs, Gannon, Schaumann and Schweigert. The strategy is, even in the rational special case, entirely different. The correlators are constructed using the extension procedures that can be devised by means of the modular microcosm principle. It is shown that, as in the rational case, the correlators admit a holographic description, with the main difference that the holographic principle is phrased in terms of factorization homology. The latter description is used to prove that the coefficients of the torus partition function are non-negative integers. Moreover, we show that the derived algebra of local operators associated to a consistent system of correlators carries a Batalin-Vilkovisky structure. We prove that it is equivalent to the Batalin-Vilkovisky structure on the Hochschild cohomology of the pivotal module category of boundary conditions, for the notion of pivotality due to Schaumann and Shimizu. This proves several expectations formulated by Kapustin-Rozansky and Fuchs-Schweigert for general conformal field theories.</p></details>

We introduce a polygonal wheel in a plane for each case of ADE, called the Coxeter wheel.

This wheel is in fact derived from the Milnor fiber of corresponding simple singularities of two variables, and the bilinear form on the geometric root system is the negative of its symmetrized Seifert form. Furthermore, we give a completely geometric definition of simple Lie algebras using arcs, Seifert form and variation operator of the singularity theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the group algebra $\mathbf{k}[S_n]$ of the $n$-th symmetric group $S_n$ over a commutative ring $\mathbf{k}$. For any two subsets $A$ and $B$ of $[n]$, we define the elements $$ \nabla_{B,A}:=\sum_{\substack{w\in S_n;\\w\left( A\right) =B}} w \qquad \text{and} \qquad \widetilde{\nabla}_{B,A}:=\sum_{\substack{w\in S_n;\\w\left( A\right) \subseteq B}}w $$ of $\mathcal{A}$. We study these elements, showing in particular that their minimal polynomials factor into linear factors (with integer coefficients). We express the product $\nabla_{D,C}\nabla_{B,A}$ as a $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combination of $\nabla_{U,V}$'s. More generally, for any two set compositions (i.e., ordered set partitions) $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ of $\left\{ 1,2,\ldots,n\right\} $, we define $\nabla_{\mathbf{B},\mathbf{A}}\in\mathcal{A}$ to be the sum of all permutations $w\in S_n$ that send each block of $\mathbf{A}$ to the corresponding block of $\mathbf{B}$. This generalizes $\nabla_{B,A}$. The factorization property of minimal polynomials does not extend to the $\nabla_{\mathbf{B},\mathbf{A}}$, but we describe the ideal spanned by the $\nabla_{\mathbf{B},\mathbf{A}}$ and a further ideal complementary to it. These two ideals have a "mutually annihilative" relationship, are free as $\mathbf{k}$-modules, and appear as annihilators of tensor product $S_n$-representations; they are also closely related to Murphy's cellular bases, Specht modules, pattern-avoiding permutations and even some algebras appearing in quantum information theory.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This article investigates the Hodge theory of the moduli space of genus $g$ curves with $n$ marked points, establishing new connections between Schur-Weyl duality for $\mathfrak{sp}_{g}$ and higher Abel-Jacobi invariants. We develop a represe\\ ntation-theoretic framework that decomposes higher Abel-Jacobi invariants of tautological cycles in $C_{g}^{n}$ according to symplectic Lie algebra representations, leveraging the Leray filtration and motivic decompositions compatible with $\mathfrak{sp}_{2g}$-actions. Central to this work is the introduction of \textbf{higher Faber-Pandharipande cycles} $FP_n = \pi_1^{\times 2}(\Delta_{12}^n \cdot \psi_1)$ in $CH^{n+1}(C_g^2)$, a new family of tautological cycles generalizing classical constructions. We prove these cycles are non-torsion under optimal genus constraints: for families over $(n-1)$-dimensional bases, $FP_n$ is not rationally equivalent to zero when $g \geq 3n+1$. Furthermore, we determine the precise position of $FP_n$ in the Leray filtration of $C_g^2 \to M_g$, showing it lies in depth $n+1$ but no deeper, with explicit non-vanishing in $H^{n+1}(M_g, R^{n+1}f_*\mathbb{Q})$ on the $V_{(n+1,1)}$-isotypic component. This yields the first systematic link between Schur-Weyl duality and higher transcendental invariants, revealing that higher diagonals encode geometric phenomena invisible to standard tautological classes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that, up to scaling, there exist only finitely many isometry classes of Hermitian lattices over $O_E$ of signature $(1,n)$ that admit ball quotients of non-general type, where $n>12$ is even and $E=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-D})$ for prime discriminant $-D<-3$. Furthermore, we show that even-dimensional ball quotients, associated with arithmetic subgroups of $\mathrm{U}(1,n)$ defined over $E$, are always of general type if $n > 207$, or $n>12$ and $D>2557$. To establish these results, we construct a nontrivial full-level cusp form of weight $n$ on the $n$-dimensional complex ball. A key ingredient in our proof is the use of Arthur's multiplicity formula from the theory of automorphic representations.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We show that bounded type implies finite type for a constructible subcategory of the module category of a finitely generated algebra over a field, which is a variant of the first Brauer-Thrall conjecture. A full subcategory is constructible if it consists of all modules that vanish on a finitely presented functor. Our approach makes use of the Ziegler spectrum of a ring and a connection, established in this work, with the scheme of finite dimensional modules. We also discuss a variant of the second Brauer-Thrall conjecture in this setting. It is shown to be true under additional assumptions on the algebra, but wrong in general. Lastly, it is proven that exact structures and matrix reductions give rise to constructible subcategories. Based on this, a translation from matrix reductions to reductions of exact structures is provided.</p></details>

This completes a trilogy connecting the zeta functions of ramified and split quadratic orders to the classical Andrews--Gordon and Bressoud identities, respectively. We provide strong evidence for this conjecture by deriving the first explicit formulas for the finitized Coh zeta function of the simplest order in the family, and for the $t=1$ specialization of the finitized Coh zeta functions for all orders in the family. Our primary tool is a new method based on M\"obius inversion on posets.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we demonstrate that, given an orthonormal basis of holomorphic Hecke cusp forms, conditionally, quadratic forms composed of cusp forms -- each expressed as a bounded linear combination of holomorphic Hecke cusp forms -- are generally not themselves expressible as bounded linear combinations of holomorphic Hecke cusp forms when the sum of the weights exceeds some absolute constant, provided that the coefficients of the quadratic form satisfy appropriate nonvanishing and boundedness conditions. This illustrates the finiteness of the number of solutions to the linear equation of modular forms equated to a quadratic form of large weight. We also show that, conditionally, for $0 < p < 2$, the $\ell^p$-norm of such quadratic forms in holomorphic Hecke cusp forms tends to zero asymptotically with respect to expansion in this orthonormal basis of Hecke eigenforms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove that every Grothendieck topology induces a hereditary torsion pair in the category of presheaves of modules on a ringed site, and obtain a homological characterization of sheaves of modules: a presheaf of modules is a sheaf of modules if and only if it is saturated with respect to torsion presheaves, or equivalently, it is right perpendicular to torsion presheaves in the sense of Geigle and Lenzing. We also study Grothendieck topologies on directed categories $\mathscr{C}$ satisfying certain finiteness condition, and show that every Grothendieck topology on $\mathscr{C}$ is a subcategory topology if and only if $\mathscr{C}$ is an artinian EI category. Consequently, in this case every sheaf category is equivalent to the presheaf category over a full subcategory of $\mathscr{C}$. Finally, we classify all Grothendieck topologies on a special type of noetherian EI categories, and extend the locally self-injective property of representations of $\mathrm{F}$ and $\mathrm{VI}$ to representations of their infinite full subcategories. Some potential applications in group representation theory are given at the end of this paper.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Multiple zeta values arise as special values of polylogarithms defined on Riemann surfaces of various genera. Building on the vast knowledge for classical and elliptic multiple zeta values, we explore a canonical extension of the formalism to Riemann surfaces of higher genera, which yields higher-genus multiple zeta values. We provide a regularization prescription for higher-genus polylogarithms, which we extend to higher-genus multiple zeta values. Our regularization uses the Schottky uniformization to trace back higher-genus endpoint regularization to known regularization at genus one. Additionally, we are commenting on relations among higher-genus multiple zeta values implied by degeneration of the underlying geometry, where we distinguish between the two types of separating and non-separating degeneration. Finally, employing functional relations for higher-genus polylogarithms in the Schottky uniformization, we explore relations among higher-genus multiple zeta values and check them against our numerical testing setup. We identify relations for higher-genus multiple zeta values beyond those implied by polylogarithm identities, thereby matching the situation for genus zero and genus one. While we find several known structures for elliptic multiple zeta values to generalize to relations for higher-genus multiple zeta values, there are further classes of relations arising from the interplay and combinatorics of different cycles.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There is a homomorphism of associative superalgebras from the enveloping algebra of the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ to the Weyl-Clifford superalgebra $W(2n|n)$ with $2n$ even Weyl algebra generators and $n$ odd Clifford algebra generators. Under this homomorphism, the positive odd root vector $x\in\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ is sent to the Dirac operator $\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\in W(2n|n)$ and generates a left ideal $I$. The corresponding reduction (super)algebra, denoted $Z_n$, is the normalizer of $I$ in $W(2n|n)$ modulo $I$. By construction, $Z_n$ acts on the space of all Clifford algebra-valued polynomial solutions to the (massless) Dirac equation. In this paper, we find a complete presentation of (a localization of) this so-termed Dirac reduction algebra. Furthermore, we use the Dirac reduction algebra to generate all polynomial solutions to the Dirac equation in $n$-dimensional flat spacetime.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We provide an algorithmic framework for the computation of explicit representing matrices for all irreducible representations of a generalized symmetric group $\Grin_n$, i.e., a wreath product of cyclic group of order $r$ with the symmetric group $\Symm_n$. The basic building block for this framework is the Specht matrix, a matrix with entries $0$ and $\pm1$, defined in terms of pairs of certain words. Combinatorial objects like Young diagrams and Young tableaus arise naturally from this setup. In the case $r = 1$, we recover Young's natural representations of the symmetric group. For general $r$, a suitable notion of pairs of $r$-words is used to extend the construction to generalized symmetric groups. Separately, for $r = 2$, where $\Grin_n$ is the Weyl group of type $B_n$, a different construction is based on a notion of pairs of biwords.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The spectral zeta functions have been found many application in several branches of modern physics, including the quantum field theory, the string theory and the cosmology. In this paper, we shall consider the spectral zeta functions and their functional determinants in the $p$-adic field. Our approach for the constructions of $p$-adic spectral zeta functions is to apply the $p$-adic Mellin transforms with respect to locally analytic functions $f$, where $f$ interpolates the spectrum for the Hamiltonian of a quantum model.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a finite group $\Gamma$, we study the distribution of the Galois group $G_{\emptyset}^{\#}(K)$ of the maximal unramified extension of $K$ that is split completely at $\infty$ and has degree prime to $|\Gamma|$ and $\textit{Char}(K)$, as $K$ varies over imaginary $\Gamma$-extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$. In the function field case, we compute the moments of the distribution of $G_{\emptyset}^{\#}(K)$ by counting points on Hurwitz stacks. In order to understand the probability of the distribution, we prove that $G_{\emptyset}^{\#}(K)$ admits presentations of a specific form, then use this presentation to build random groups to simulate the behavior of $G_{\emptyset}^{\#}(K)$, and make the conjecture to predict the distribution using the probability measures of these random groups. Our results provide the imaginary analog of the work of Wood, Zureick-Brown, and the first author on the nonabelian Cohen--Lenstra heuristics.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In a recent paper, Aistleitner, Gantert, Kabluchko, Prochno and Ramanan studied large deviation principles (LDPs) for lacunary trigonometric sums $\sum_{n=1}^N \cos(2 \pi n_k x)$, where the sequence $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ satisfies the Hadamard gap condition $n_{k+1} / n_k \geq q > 1$ for $k \geq 1$. A crucial ingredient in their work were asymptotic estimates for the moment generating function (MGF) of such sums, which turned out to depend on the fine arithmetic structure of the sequence $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ in an intricate way. In the present paper we carry out a detailed study of the MGF for lacunary trigonometric sums (without any structural assumptions on the underlying sequence, other than lacunarity), and we determine the sharp threshold where arithmetic effects start to play a role. As an application, we prove moderate deviation principles for lacunary trigonometric sums, and show that the tail probabilities are in accordance with Gaussian behavior throughout the whole range between the central limit theorem and the LDP regime.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $r \geq 2$ be an integer, $q$ a prime power and $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ the finite field with $q$ elements. Consider the problem of showing existence of primitive elements in a subset $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^r}$. We prove a sieve criterion for existence of such elements, dependent only on an estimate for the character sum $\sum_{\gamma \in \mathcal{A}}\chi(\gamma)$. The flexibility and direct applicability of our criterion should be of considerable interest for problems in this field. We demonstrate the utility of our result by tackling a problem of Fernandes and Reis (2021) with $\mathcal{A}$ avoiding affine hyperplanes, obtaining significant improvements over previous knowledge.</p></details>

This article presents an algorithm to determine the image of the mod-$3$ Galois representation associated to a principally polarized abelian surface over $\mathbb{Q}$. Conjugacy class distribution of subgroups of $\mathrm{GSp}(4,\mathbb{F}_3)$ is a key ingredient. While this ingredient is feasible to compute for $\mathrm{GSp}(4,\mathbb{F}_{\ell})$ for any small prime $\ell$, distinguishing Gassmann-equivalent subgroups is a delicate problem. We accomplish it for $\ell = 3$ using several techniques. The algorithm does not require the knowledge of endomorphisms.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathbb{R}^m$ be endowed with the Euclidean metric. The covering radius of a lattice $\Lambda \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ is the least distance $r$ such that, given any point of $\mathbb{R}^m$, the distance from that point to $\Lambda$ is not more than $r$. Lattices can occur via the unit group of the ring of integers in an algebraic number field $\mathbb{K}$, by applying a logarithmic embedding $\mathbb{K}^*\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$. In this paper, we examine those lattices which arise from the cyclotomic number field $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)$, for a given positive integer $n\geq5$ such that $n\not \equiv 2\pmod{4}$. We then provide improvements to an upper bound in (de Araujo, 2024), and conclude with an upper bound on the covering radius for this lattice in terms of $n$ and the number of its distinct prime factors. In particular, we improve Lemma 2 of (de Araujo, 2024) and show that, asymptotically, it can be improved no further.</p></details>

Our approach differs fundamentally from existing methods, as we neither restrict to any specific singular variety nor fix the characteristic. Instead, we design a {\it universal} blowup process that {\it simultaneously} resolves all possible singularities, and, our method is entirely characteristic-free.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We consider certain Lambert series as generating functions of divisor sums twisted by Dirichlet characters and compute their exact resurgent transseries expansion near $q=1^-$. For special values of the parameters, these Lambert series are expressible in terms of iterated integrals of holomorphic Eisenstein series twisted by the same characters and the transseries representation is a direct consequence of the action of Fricke involution on such twisted Eisenstein series. When the parameters of the Lambert series are generic the transseries representation provides for a quantum-modular version of Fricke involution which for a particular example we show being equivalent to modular resurgent structures found in topological strings observables.</p></details>

> **Comment:** Adds picture

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>"Murmurations" are a recently-discovered type of fine structure in sums of Dirichlet coefficients averaged over families of $L$-functions. The root cause of this phenomenon remains mysterious. In the present paper, we demonstrate how murmurations arise from the averaging of approximate functional equations. This approach to the study of murmurations explains their empirically observed ubiquity, as well as their characteristic scale invariance and the peculiar normalization they demand. We implement our new approach to the study of murmurations in the case of quadratic twist families of $\mathrm{GL}_1$ automorphic representations, where we exhibit murmurations unconditionally. Our proof centres around estimating mean values of the $L$-functions in our quadratic twist families. In particular, we require estimates valid significantly higher in the critical strip than what existing results provide. To produce these estimates, we construct a variation of the approximate functional equation which is imbued with a mechanism for dynamically rebalancing error terms while preserving holomorphicity. We also generalize and sharpen results of Jutila and Stankus on sums of quadratic characters and fundamental discriminants. Mean value estimates are given for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ quadratic twist families as well.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We present a large number of analytic evaluations of Euler sums, namely sums such as \begin{align} M(m,n_0,n_1,n_2, \ldots, n_t) &= \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{H(k)^m}{k^{n_0} (k+1)^{n_1} (k+2)^{n_2} \cdots (k+t)^{n_t}}, \nonumber \end{align} for nonnegative integers $m$ and $(n_i)$, with $m \geq 1$ and $n_0 + n_1 + \cdots + n_t \geq 2$, where $H(k) = \sum_{j=1}^k 1/j$ is the harmonic function. These results were obtained either by algebraic derivations, or else by very high-precision numerical evaluations combined with an integer relation algorithm to obtain the analytic formulas. We show how many of these results can be derived from a few basic facts, and that these techniques are applicable to Euler sums of even more general forms than the above cases. We then show that these results permit the calculation of constants for Euler sums resembling the Stieltjes $\gamma$ constants arising in the theory of the Riemann zeta function, and we also present some preliminary results on the asymptotic behavior of these constants.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We give an asymptotic formula for the number of rational points of bounded height on algebraic varieties defined by systems of multihomogeneous diagonal equations. The proof uses the Hardy-Littlewood circle method and the hyperbola method developed by Blomer and Br\"udern.</p></details>
