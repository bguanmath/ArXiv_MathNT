<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $v(k)$ be the smallest integer larger than $1$ that does not occur among the denominators in any identity of the form $$ 1=\frac1{n_1}+\cdots+\frac1{n_k}, $$ where $1 \le n_1<\cdots<n_k$ are pairwise distinct integers. In their 1980 monograph, Erdős and Graham asked for quantitative estimates on the growth of $v(k)$ and suggested the lower bound $v(k)\gg k!$. In this paper we give the first known improvement and show that there exists an absolute constant $c>0$ such that the inequality $$ v(k)\ge e^{c k^2} $$ holds for all positive integers $k$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this series of papers, we investigate properties of a finite group which are determined by its low degree irreducible representations over a number field $F$, i.e. its representations on matrix rings $\mathrm{M}_n(D)$ with $n \leq 2$. In particular we focus on representations on $\mathrm{M}_2(D)$ where $D$ is a division algebra having an order $\mathcal{O}$ such that $\mathcal{O}$ has finitely many units, i.e. such that $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathcal{O})$ has arithmetic rank $1$. In this first part, the focus is on two aspects. One aspect concerns characterisations of such representing spaces in terms of Serre's homological goodness property, small virtual cohomological dimension and higher Kleinian-type embeddings. As an application, we obtain several characterisations of the finite groups $G$ whose irreducible representations are of the mentioned form. In particular, such groups $G$ are precisely those such that $\mathcal{U}(R G)$, with $R$ the ring of integers of $F$, can be constructed from groups which virtually map onto a non-abelian free group. Along the way we investigate the latter property for congruence subgroups of higher modular groups and its implications for the congruence kernel. This is used to obtain new information on the congruence kernel of the unit group of a group ring. The second aspect concerns the conjugacy classes of the images of finite subgroups of $\mathcal{U}(R G)$ under the irreducible representations of $G$. More precisely, we initiate the study of a blockwise variant of the Zassenhaus conjectures and the subgroup isomorphism problem. Moreover, we contribute to them for the low rank representations above.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The generalized Markoff mod $p$ graph is defined via the equation $x^2+y^2+z^2=xyz+κ$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$ of prime order $p$. In this paper, we investigate the topological properties of the graph such as non-planarity, surface embeddability, and the existence of short cycles. Our approach is based on a systematic construction of $K_{3,3}$-subdivisions, integrating techniques from graph theory, computer algebra, and number theory.</p></details>

> **Comment:** The present straightforward proof of Theorem 10.3 (which prepares for the crucial Theorem 10.4) substitutes for the absurd argument left here in the last version, for which we apologize

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Weyl symbolic calculus of operators leads to the construction, if one takes for symbol a certain distribution decomposing over the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, of an operator with the following property: the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the validity of a collection of estimates involving this operator. Pseudodifferential arithmetic, a novel chapter of pseudodifferential operator theory, makes it possible to make the operator under study fully explicit. This leads to a disproof of the conjecture: the set of real parts of non-trivial zeros of zeta is a dense subset of [0,1]..</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Permutation polynomials over finite fields have extensive applications in various areas. Particularly, permutation polynomials with simple forms are of great interest. In recent papers, several classes of permutation polynomials of the form $L(X)+Tr_q^{q^3}(h(X))$ have been constructed. This paper further investigates permutation polynomials of such form over $\mathbb{F}_{q^3}$. Unlike previous studies, we transform the problem of constructing univariate permutation polynomials over finite fields into that of constructing corresponding multivariate permutations over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$-vector spaces. Through this approach, we completely characterize a class of permutation polynomials of the form $L(X)+γTr_q^{q^3}(c_1X+c_2X^2+c_3X^3+c_4X^{q+2})$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^3}$, where $q=2^m$, $L(X)=X^q+aX$ and $a,c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4,γ\in\mathbb{F}_q$ with $a^2+a+1\neq0$. Furthermore, using a similar method, we generalize several results from a recent work by Jiang, Li and Qu (2026).</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Amdeberhan and Merca recently studied arithmetic properties of the sequence $a(n)$, the reciprocal of the crank parity function, which counts the number of integer partitions of weight $n$ whose even parts are monochromatic and whose odd parts may appear in one of three colors (OEIS A298311). A key result of their work was the congruence $a(7n + 2) \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ for all $n \geq 0$. We prove new congruences for the reciprocal crank parity function modulo powers of $7$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 36 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we introduce the notion of mutation semigroup algebras. This concept simultaneously generalizes cluster algebras and semigroup algebras. We show that, under some mild conditions on the singularities, the spectrum $U={\rm Spec}(R)$ of a mutation semigroup algebra $R$ admits a log Fano compactification $U\hookrightarrow X$. The compactification $X$ can be chosen to be a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial log Fano variety whenever $U$ is $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial. Furthermore, we prove that a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial klt Fano variety $X$ is of cluster type if and only if its Cox ring ${\rm Cox}(X)$ is a ${\rm Cl}(X)$-graded mutation semigroup algebra. In order to enlighten the previous theorems, we provide several explicit examples motivated by birational geometry, representation theory, and combinatorics.</p></details>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date:** 2025-12-25 &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Authors:** Zeraoulia Rafik, Pedro Caceres &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Category:** math.NT &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; 


> **Comment:** This revision strengthens results on congruences for iterates of the sum--power divisor function, proves the uniqueness of \(n=6\) in the prime--\(L\) multiperfect case, fills gaps in earlier proofs, and introduces an entropy-based dynamical study with conjectural links to Robin-type criteria and GUE statistics

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Inspired by Cohen and te Riele~\cite{Cohen1996}, who computationally verified that for every $n \leq 400$ there exists $k$ such that $σ^k(n) \equiv 0 \pmod{n}$ (where $σ^k$ denotes the $k$-fold iteration of the sum-of-divisors function), this paper resolves their reverse question negatively: no integer $n > 1$ satisfies $σ^k(n) \equiv 0 \pmod{n}$ for \emph{all} $k \geq 1$. The proof eliminates prior gaps via Lenstra's density-zero bounds $σ_k(m) \ll m / \log\log m$ combined with Robin's RH-equivalent criterion $σ(n) < e^γn \log\log n + 0.6483 n / \log\log n$ ($n \geq 5041$), showing universal metaperfect divisibility implies RH-violating $σ$ growth or low-lying zeta zeros near $s=1$. Among multiperfect $n$ with prime $L = \mathrm{lcm}(1+e_p : p \mid n)$, only $n=6$ satisfies the congruence for all odd $k$, with Shannon entropy $H(σ^k(6) \mod 6) \to \log 2$ reflecting periodic order. We analyze bifurcation phenomena in the dynamics $σ^k(n) \mod n$, where high-entropy chaotic residues for other $n$ mirror GUE statistics of zeta zeros ($\sim \log T / 2π$ near $s=1/2$, $>41\%$ verified on critical line), contrasting the ordered $n=6$ case. Zero rates near $s=1$ (simple pole) and $s=1/2$ bound iterated $σ$ distributions, linking to RH via divisor sums and dynamical bifurcations; we conjecture $n=6$ uniquely achieves odd-$k$ divisibility with small period dividing $L$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 32 pages, 7 figures; v4: typographical errors fixed, references added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We prove the full Fock--Goncharov conjecture for $\mathcal{A}_{SL_2,Σ_{g,p}}$, the $\mathcal{A}$-cluster variety of the moduli of decorated twisted $SL_2$-local systems on triangulable surfaces $Σ_{g,p}$ with at least 2 punctures. Equivalently, we show that the tagged skein algebra $Sk^{ta}(Σ)$, or the middle cluster algebra $\mathrm{mid}(\mathcal{A})$, coincides with the upper cluster algebra $U(Σ)$. Inspired by the work of Shen--Sun--Weng, we introduce the localized cluster variety $\mathring{\mathcal{A}}$ as the algebraic version of the decorated Teichmüller space $\mathcal{T}^d(Σ)$. We show its global section $Γ(\mathring{\mathcal{A}},\mathcal{O}_{\mathring{\mathcal{A}}})$ equals the classical Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_{q\to1}(Σ)$, thereby providing a quantization of $\mathcal{T}^d(Σ)$ in terms of the Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_q(Σ)$. As a consequence of our geometric characterizations, we deduce normality and the Gorenstein property of the tagged skein algebra $Sk^{ta}(Σ)$ and the classical Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_{q\to1}(Σ)$, as well as finite generation of upper cluster algebra $U(Σ)$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $N_d(G,X)$ denote the number of degree $d$ extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ with Galois closure $G$ and $|Δ_K|\leq X$. Malle's conjecture predicts an asymptotic of the form $N_d(G,X)\sim CX^α(\log X)^β$. Previously, Klüners proved Malle's conjecture for $G=C_2 \wr S_4$. His proof gives a power savings of $O(X^{7/8})$. We improve Klüners' result by establishing a stronger power saving error term for the count of such fields. Specifically, we show $N_8(C_2\wr S_4,X)=CX+O(X^{3/4-1/30})$. Additionally, we obtain new bounds on $N_8(G,X)$ for the groups $S_4$, $C_2^3 \rtimes S_4$, $GL_2 (\mathbb{F}_3)$, and $Q_8\rtimes S_4$ as permutation subgroups of $S_8$.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We find exact identities for sums of the form \begin{equation*}\label{eq:convsumabs} \sum_{\stackrel{n_1+n_2 = n}{n_1 \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{ 0, n \} }} Q(n_1,n_2) σ_{-r_1}(n_1) σ_{-r_2}(n_2), \end{equation*} where $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $r_1,r_2\in\mathbb{C}$, $Q$ is a combination of hypergeometric functions, and $σ_{a}(x)$ denotes the divisor function. Specifically, we find that they can be expressed in terms of Fourier coefficients of Hecke cusp forms weighted by their $L$-values. This result expands upon previous work with Radchenko in which such identities were found for divisor functions with even integer index \cite{FKLR} and encompasses results of Jacobi \cite{motohashi1994binary} and Diamantis and O'Sullivan in \cite{diamantis2010kernels, o2023identities} for divisor functions with odd integer index. The proof of our result expresses these sums in terms of Estermann zeta functions and uses trace formulae. In addition, we use a regularization of divergent convolution sums to provide a mathematical explanation for $L$-values (non-critical in the sense of Deligne) appearing in modular graph functions \cite{DKS2021_2}.</p></details>

These papers, whose first two are already prepared, would provide a whole theory for these new functions.The author has decided that it is better publish his findings in a complete manner in a single paper as it would give a more total and satisfactory view of the newly developed theory

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this paper, we expand the theory of Weierstrassian elliptic functions by introducing auxiliary zeta functions $ζ_λ$, zeta differences of first kind $Δ_λ$ and second kind $Δ_{λ,μ}$ where $λ,μ=1,2,3$. Fundamental and novel results pertaining to these functions are proven. Furthermore, results already existing in the literature are translated in terms of auxiliary zeta functions. Their relationship to Jacobian elliptic functions and Jacobian functions are given.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, we study the Zariski closure of modular points in the two-dimensional universal deformation space when the residual Galois representation is reducible. Unlike the previous approaches in the residually irreducible case from Gouvêa-Mazur, Böckle and Allen, our method relies on local-global compatibility results, potential pro-modularity arguments and a non-ordinary finiteness result between the local deformation ring at $p$ and the global deformation ring. This allows us to construct sufficiently many non-ordinary regular de Rham points whose modularity is guaranteed by the recent progress on the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture. Also, we will discuss some applications of our main results, including the equidimensionality of certain big Hecke algebras and big $R=\mathbb{T}$ theorems in the residually reducible case.</p></details>

For real-valued G-additive functions (additive in the greedy G-digits), we establish an Erdős-Wintner-type theorem: convergence of two canonical series (a first-moment series and a quadratic digit-energy series) is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a limiting distribution along initial segments of the integers. In that case, the limiting characteristic function admits an explicit infinite-product factorization whose local factors depend only on the underlying digit system. We also indicate conditional extensions of this two-series criterion to Ostrowski numeration systems with bounded partial quotients and to Parry $β$-expansions with Pisot-Vijayaraghavan base $β$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 17 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The efficient classical simulation of Clifford circuits constitutes a fundamental barrier to quantum advantage, typically overcome by injecting explicit non-Clifford "magic" resources. We demonstrate that for high-dimensional quantum systems (qudits), the resources required to break this barrier are strictly governed by the number-theoretic structure of the Hilbert space dimension $d$. By analyzing the adjoint action of the Clifford group, we establish a classification of single-qudit universality as a trichotomy. (I) For prime dimensions, the Clifford group is a maximal finite subgroup, and universality is robustly achieved by any non-Clifford gate. (II) For prime-power dimensions, the group structure fragments, requiring tailored diagonal non-Clifford gates to restore irreducibility. (III) Most notably, for composite dimensions with coprime factors, we demonstrate that standard entangling operations alone -- specifically, generalized intra-qudit CNOT gates -- generate the necessary non-Clifford resources to guarantee a dense subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(d)$ without explicit diagonal magic injection. Our proofs rely on a new geometric criterion establishing that a subgroup with irreducible adjoint action is infinite if it contains a non-scalar element with projective distance strictly less than $1/2$ from the identity. These results establish that "coprime architectures" -- hybrid registers combining subsystems with coprime dimensions -- can sustain universal computation using only classical entangling operations, rendering the explicit injection of magic resources algebraically unnecessary.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We establish a unified group-theoretic framework bridging the arithmetic homotopy exact sequence of a variety and the Birman exact sequence of a surface. Within this framework, we reinterpret classical arithmetic notions - such as the descent of varieties and of covers - and construct their topological analogues. We formalize the parallel setting between closed subgroups of the absolute Galois group and subgroups of the Mapping Class Group of a base space and their actions on fundamental groups. This provides an analogy between arithmetic and topological invariants, allowing us to define the groups of moduli, definition, and invariance in both settings. Using this unified perspective, some purely group-theoretic proofs provide results in both settings simultaneously. Applications include a topological analogue of Weil's Descent Theorem for mapping class groups and an adaptation of Débes and Douai's cohomological obstructions regarding descent of algebraic covers to the topological setting. Finally, we elevate these results to the categorical level. We demonstrate that the classical Weil cocycle condition is equivalent to the existence of a linearization in the language of equivariant categories. Applying this perspective to the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves $\mathsf{D^b}(X)$, we show that the equivariant derived category $\mathsf{D^b}(X)^G$, under the action induced by a Weil descent datum, recovers the derived category of the descended variety.</p></details>

Let $\|f\|$ denote the Petersson norm of $f$. We study a weighted second moment of the central value of the $L$-function associated to $f$ over an orthogonal basis $H_κ(4)$ of $S_κ(Γ_0(4))$. This corresponds to studying the following sum: $$\sum_{f\in H_κ(4)}\frac{Λ_f(n)\vert L(1/2,f)\vert^2}{\|f\|^2}.$$ Using the relative trace formula, we obtain an asymptotic formula for the second moment. We then use the method of amplification to get the subconvexity bound $$L(1/2,f)\ll_{\varepsilon} (κ^2)^{\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{40}+\varepsilon}.$$ This is the first subconvexity result for half-integral weight modular forms in the weight aspect.

> **Comment:** Title changed; Results on unitarizable modules over classical Lie algebras added

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $\mathfrak{g}$ denote the classical Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_d$, $\mathfrak{sp}_{2d}$, or $\mathfrak{so}_{2d}$ with a fixed $*$-structure $σ$. Let $M_1, \ldots, M_\ell$ be unitarizable $\mathfrak{g}$-modules (with respect to $σ$), and let ${\bf z}=(z_1, \ldots, z_\ell) \in \mathbb{C}^\ell$. We investigate the action of the Bethe algebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathfrak{g}}^μ$ for $\mathfrak{g}$ with respect to $μ\in \mathfrak{g}^*$ on the tensor product $\underline{M}({\bf z}):=M_1(z_1) \otimes \cdots \otimes M_\ell(z_\ell)$ of evaluation $\mathfrak{g}[t]$-modules. We show that if $μ\circ σ$ equals the complex conjugation of $μ$, then $\mathcal{B}_{\mathfrak{g}}^μ$ is diagonalizable on any finite-dimensional $\mathcal{B}_{\mathfrak{g}}^μ$-submodule of $\underline{M}({\bf z})$ for ${\bf z} \in \mathbb{R}^\ell$. This, together with the result derived from the duality of Bethe algebras (see below), suggests that a simple spectrum conjecture for $\mathcal{B}_{\mathfrak{g}}^μ$ should hold. We establish a duality of Bethe algebras for the general linear Lie (super)algebras $\mathfrak{gl}_d$ and $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$. As an application, we show that under a generic condition, the Bethe algebra for $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$ with respect to ${\bf z} \in \mathbb{C}^{p+q+m+n}$ is diagonalizable with a simple spectrum on any weight space of $L_1(w_1) \otimes \cdots \otimes L_d(w_d)$, where the $L_i$ are (infinite-dimensional) unitarizable highest weight $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$-modules corresponding to generalized partitions of depth 1, and $w_1, \ldots, w_d \in \mathbb{C}$. We also obtain the corresponding result for $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m}$ by setting $q=n=0$.</p></details>

> **Comment:** 18 pages

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We propose a method to prove a polyhedral branching formula for Kirillov-Reshetikhin (KR) modules over a quantum affine algebra. When the underlying simple Lie algebra is of exceptional type, such a formula remains conjectural in many cases. Using a linear recurrence relation satisfied by the characters of KR modules, we convert the verification of a polyhedral formula into an identity between two rational functions of a single variable with only simple poles at known locations. It is then sufficient to compare the residues at those poles, which are explicitly computable quantities. By applying this strategy, we obtain new, computer-assisted and easily verifiable proofs of known polyhedral formulas in types $F_4$ and $G_2$ within a uniform framework.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For a given elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$, let $N_p(E)$ be the number of points on $E$ modulo $p$ for a prime of good reduction for $E$. Given integer $n$, let $G_k(E,n)$ be the number of $k$-tuples of $p_1<p_2<\ldots <p_k$ primes of good reduction for $E$, for which the equation in the title holds, then on assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for elliptic curves without CM (and unconditionally if the curves have complex multiplication), I show that $\varlimsup_{n\to\infty} G_k(E,n)=\infty$ for any integer $k\geq 3$. I conjecture that this result also holds for $k=1,2$ i.e. this conjecture says that there are arbitrarily long ``elliptic progressions of primes'' i.e. sequences of primes $p_1<p_2<\cdots <p_m$ of arbitrary lengths $m$ such that $N_{p_1}(E)=N_{p_2}(E)=\cdots =N_{p_m}(E)$.</p></details>

This paper carries out an analogous classification of Maass wave forms of prime power level in terms of complex even representations. The parameters are identified with techniques from class field theory and Galois representations. The classification reveals that there exist distinct Maass cusp forms of tetrahedral type on $Γ_1(\ell)$ that remain inequivalent modulo $3$ for $\ell = 7687, 16363$ and $20887$, and that these $\ell$ are the three smallest such primes.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We compute the algebraic Picard group of the category of $K(n)$-local spectra, for all heights $n$ and all primes $p$. In particular, we show that it is always finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and, whenever $n \geq 2$, is of rank $2$, thereby confirming a prediction made by Hopkins in the early 1990s. In fact, with the exception of the anomalous case $n=p=2$, we provide a full set of topological generators for these groups. Our arguments rely on recent advances in $p$-adic geometry to translate the problem to a computation on Drinfeld's symmetric space, which can then be solved using results of Colmez--Dospinescu--Niziol.</p></details>

By applying the finiteness criterion of Bilu and Tichy, we show under appropriate assumptions that equation $U_n(x)=V_m(y)$ has infinitely many solutions with bounded $\mathcal{O}_S$-denominator. We also study decomposable polynomials in third and second order linear recurrence sequences. In particular, we show that if $W_n(x)=g(h(x))$ for a simple third order linear recurrence sequence $(W_n(x))_{n\geq 0}$ of complex polynomials, then deg $g$ is bounded. Furthermore, we show that if $(u_{n_1}+u_{n_2})(x)=g(h(x))$ for a binary recurrence sequence $(u_n(x))_{n\geq 0}$ then deg $g$ is bounded.</p></details>

In doing so, we use the information about prime factorization of the value taken up by such polynomials and their higher order formal derivatives at sufficiently large integer arguments. If a lower bound for the minimum possible degree of a factor of such a polynomial is known a priori, then the integer argument becomes significantly smaller, which makes the underlying factorization result easier to apply. A result on explicit lower degree factor bound for the classes of polynomials considered in this paper is also proved via Newton polygons.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Hardy function $Z(t)=ζ(1/2+it)e^{iθ(t)}$ takes real values for real $t$ and its real zeros are zeros $ζ(s)$ on the critical line $1/2+it$. After discovering the critical value of the local maximum in 1956, Lehmer formulated the assumption that the Hardy function could have a negative local maximum or a positive local minimum. In the paper the Generalized Hardy function is defined as the real part of the Hardy function on any line $α_ν+it$ parallel to the critical line $1/2+it$ $$Z_{α_ν}(t)=Re\ ζ(α_ν+it)e^{iθ(t)}$$ and established an distinct relationship between the zeros of the $\cosθ(t)$ function and the zeros of the Generalized Hardy function. $$\forall ΔT_λ=(t_λ, t_{λ+1}],\ t_λ=2πλ^2,\ λ=1,\ 2,\ 3\ ...$$ $$\exists A_λ:\forall \hatα_λ>A_λ$$ $$|\cosθ(t) -Z_{\hatα_λ}(t)|<ε(A_λ),\ t\in ΔT_λ$$ Then the binomial series is used to establish a relationship between the values of the Generalized Hardy function on any two lines $α_ν+it$ and $α_{ν+1}+it$ parallel to the critical line. Thus, by induction between values $σ=1/2$ and $σ=\hatα_λ>A_λ$ $$α^{(λ)}_1<α^{(λ)}_2<α^{(λ)}_3<...<α^{(λ)}_ν<...<α^{(λ)}_{μ_λ}$$ an distinct relationship has been established between the zeros of the function $\cosθ(t)$ and the zeros of the Hardy function.</p></details>

To relate $p$-divisible groups and overconvergent $F$-isocrystals, we employ logarithmic Dieudonné theory, as introduced by Kato and further developed by Inoue. Over curves, this leads to an equivalence between the category of potentially semi-stable $p$-divisible groups and overconvergent $F$-isocrystals with slopes in the interval $[0,1]$.</p></details>

As an application, we obtain that the proportion of forms in the family with non-vanishing at the central point is at least $62.5\%$, assuming GRH. This is the highest non-vanishing proportion for any family associated with a unitary group.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>For finite-dimensional algebras over algebraically closed fields, we consider two fundamental classes of modules and their geometric counterparts: bricks and $τ$-rigid modules, as well as brick components and $τ$-regular components. We then apply our results in the study of some open conjectures. First, we investigate the situation where every brick is $τ$-rigid. We prove that this occurs exactly when the algebra is locally representation-directed; a family of algebras introduced by Dräxler in the 1990s, which are always representation-finite. Then, we adopt a geometric perspective and analyze the brick and $τ$-regular components of module varieties. In this greater generality, we establish new properties of such components. Inspired by some recent conjectures, we apply our results to the study of minimal brick-infinite algebras. Along the way, we construct some limits of rigid $g$-vectors, under a condition that we call the $τ$-convergence property. This construction is novel and, in certain cases, yields an integral $g$-vector lying outside the $τ$-tilting fan (a.k.a. $g$-vector fan). We show how our results provide new tools to the study of some open conjectures and particularly illustrate that for $E$-tame algebras.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Associated to all quasi-split Satake diagrams of type ADE and even spherical coweights $μ$, we introduce the shifted iYangians ${}^\imath Y_μ$ and establish their PBW bases. We construct the iGKLO representations of ${}^\imath Y_μ$, which factor through quotients called truncated shifted iYangians ${}^\imath Y_μ^λ$. In type AI with $μ$ dominant, a variant of ${}^\imath Y_μ^{N\varpi_1^\vee}$ is identified with the truncated shifted iYangians in another definition, which are isomorphic to finite W-algebras of type BCD. These new family of algebras has connections and applications to fixed point loci of affine Grassmannian slices which will be developed in a sequel.</p></details>

They generalize fractionally Calabi-Yau algebras and categorify de la Peña's algebras of cyclotomic type. Path algebras of affine type and (higher) canonical algebras are examples of Serre cyclotomic algebras. Our definition is related to Elias-Hogancamp's theory of categorical diagonalization. We compute the categorical entropy of their Serre functors, in the sense of Dimitrov-Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich, and use this to determine which graded path algebras and which homologically smooth graded gentle algebras are Serre cyclotomic. Finally, we show that trivial extension algebras of Serre cyclotomic algebras have finite global complexity.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The algebraic notion of a pivotal module category was developed by Schaumann and Shimizu and is central to the description of boundary conditions in conformal field theory according to a proposal by Fuchs and Schweigert. In this paper, we present a large class of examples of pivotal module categories of topological origin: For a unimodular finite ribbon category $\mathcal{A}$, we prove that the factorization homology $\int_Σ\mathcal{A}$ of a compact oriented surface $Σ$ with $n$ marked boundary intervals, at least one per connected component, comes with the structure of a pivotal module category over $\mathcal{A}^{\boxtimes n}$. This endows the internal skein algebras of Ben-Zvi-Brochier-Jordan, in particular the elliptic double, with a symmetric Frobenius structure. As application, we obtain, for each choice of $\mathcal{A}$, a family of full open conformal field theories, each of which comes with correlation functions for all surfaces with marked boundary intervals that are explicitly computable using factorization homology. As a further application, we explain how modified traces can be 'integrated' over surfaces: We show that the modified trace for $\mathcal{A}$ extends in a canonical way to the factorization homology of $Σ$. The resulting traces have the remarkable property of being modular invariant, i.e. fixed by the mapping class group action.</p></details>

By an application of Wiles' formula, the conjecture is shown to imply that the density of primes raising the level of a $p$-adic even representation is $$\frac{p-1}{p},$$ in agreement with the density of $2/3$ for $p=3$ observed in the data.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The {\em Prym} of a cyclic covering of smooth projective curves is the ``new'' part of the Jacobian: the quotient of the Jacobian of the covering curve by the Jacobians of the intermediate covers. Given a family of such coverings, the fundamental group of the base of the family acts on the Tate modules of the Pryms, and the image of this representation is a key ingredient in answering arithmetic statistics questions about the distribution of the group structure of the $L$-torsion of a random Prym in the family. (Over ${\mathbb{F}}_q$, the action of Frobenius is roughly uniformly distributed over the {\em arithmetic} monodromy, a coset of the image of the fundamental group of the base change to $\bar{\mathbb{F}}_q$ (the {\em geometric} monodromy).) In the present note, we show for a number of natural families that (with limited exceptions) the geometric monodromy is sandwiched between a certain unitary group and its derived subgroup. In particular, this holds for the one-parameter families obtained by starting with any fixed cover and varying one (tame) ramification point. As an application, we deduce analogous largeness results for the monodromy of the Selmer groups of elliptic surfaces with $j=0$ or $j=1728$, by relating them to cyclic covers of degree 6 or 4 respectively, implying that their Selmer groups do not satisfy the standard heuristics. For instance, for eliptic surfaces with $j=0$ of sufficiently large height over ${\mathbb{P}}^1_{\mathbb{F}_q}$, the average size of the $l$-Selmer group is $l+3+o_q(1)$ when $l$ (fixed) and $q$ (large) are both 1 mod 3, compared to $l+1+o_q(1)$ for general elliptic surfaces.</p></details>

As an application, we determine the range of branch degrees for which Ulrich line bundles could exist, and we show that every even bidouble plane carries a special rank-two Ulrich bundle. Our method combines the invariant-theoretic decomposition of $H^2(S,\mathbb{Q})$ under the Galois group with cohomological criteria for Ulrich bundles.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Since the time of Minkowski a basic problem in number theory has been to find lower bounds for the absolute value $Δ(K)$ of the discriminant of a number field $K$ in terms of the degree $n(K)$ of $K$. In this paper we study another measure of the size of $K$ given by the covering radius $μ(K)$ of the ring of integers $O_K$ of $K$. Here $μ(K)$ is the $L^2$ radius $||V_2(K)||_2$ of the $L^2$ Voronoi cell $V_2(K)$ of $O_K$, where $V_2(K)$ is the set of points in $\mathbb{R} \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}} K$ that are at least as close to the origin as they are to any non-zero element of $O_K$. To put a limit on what lower bounds one can prove for $μ(K)$ in terms of $n(K)$, we study infinite families of $K$ of increasing degree for which $μ(K)$ can be bounded above by an explicit power of $n(K)$. We also study analogous questions when the $L^2$ norm is replaced by the $L^\infty$ norm.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There are three universal $2$-parameter vertex algebras $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$, $\mathcal{W}^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$, and $\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ which are freely generated of types $\mathcal{W}(2,3,4,\dots)$, $\mathcal{W}(2,4,6,\dots)$, and $\mathcal{W}(1^3, 2, 3^3, 4,\dots)$, respectively. They serve as classifying objects for vertex algebras with these generating types satisfying mild hypotheses. Their $1$-parameter quotients are expected to be the building blocks of all $\mathcal{W}$-algebras of classical Lie types. Furthermore, such $\mathcal{W}$-algebras are expected to be organized into families that are governed by new universal $2$-parameter vertex algebras, which are themselves glueings of copies of $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$ in type $A$ (together with a Heisenberg algebra), and copies of $\mathcal{W}^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$ and $\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ in types $B$, $C$, and $D$. We denote these universal objects by $\mathcal{W}^{X,S,M}_{\infty}$, where $X$ denotes the Lie type (either $A$, $C$, or $BD$ since types $B$ and $D$ can be treated uniformly), and $S$, $M$ are sets of positive integers that determine certain families of partitions. More precisely, for a partition $P = (n_0^{m_0}, n_1^{m_1},\dots, n_{t}^{m_t})$ of $N = \sum_{i=0}^t n_i m_i$ consisting of $m_i$ parts of size $n_i$, where $n_0> n_1 > \cdots > n_t \geq 2$, $M = \{m_0,\dots, m_t\}$ is the set of multiplicities, and $S = \{d_1,\dots, d_t\}$ is the set of height differences $d_{i+1} = n_i - n_{i+1}$. After introducing this general conjectural picture, we will construct the first nontrivial example $\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{so}_2}_{\infty}:=\mathcal{W}^{BD, \emptyset, \{2\}}_{\infty}$, which is a glueing of two copies of $\mathcal{W}^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$.</p></details>

These Comer schemes generalize the notion of a Ramsey scheme and may be of independent interest. As an application, we give the first finite representation of $34_{65}$. This leaves $33_{65}$ as the only remaining relation algebra in the family $N_{65}$ with a flexible atom that is not known to be finitely representable. Motivated by this, we complement our upper bounds with some lower bounds. Using a SAT solver, we show that $33_{65}$ is not finitely representable on fewer than $24$ points, and that $33_{65}$ does not admit a cyclic group representation on fewer than $120$ points. We also employ a SAT solver to show that $34_{65}$ is not representable on fewer than $24$ points.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Let $k$ be a perfect ring of characteristic $p>0$, and let $R$ be an animated $k$-algebra. This note aims to show that the Nygaard filtered prismatization $R^{\mathrm{Nyg}}$ of $R$ is naturally isomorphic, as a stack over $k^{\mathrm{Nyg}}$, to the relative spectrum over $k^{\mathrm{Nyg}}$ of the Rees algebra of the Nygaard filtered prismatic cohomology of $R$ relative to $k$. In doing so, we axiomatise the functorial affineness property displayed by the relative Nygaard filtered prismatization, and dub it de Rham affineness after the fundamental example of the functor sending an animated ring to its relative de Rham stack. While we treat this concept as an organising tool for the author's forthcoming work on the syntomification of Frobenius liftable schemes, we are able to frame some questions based on a structural theorem of independent interest: a functor to stacks which is de Rham affine often arises via ring stacks through transmutation.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this note, we make explicit the correspondence between Harish-Chandra parameters and Langlands-Vogan parameters for symplectic groups and orthogonal groups of equal rank over reals. As an application, we reformulate Moeglin's results and Paul's work on the Howe correspondence for symplectic-orthogonal dual pairs using Langlands-Vogan parameters.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A problem raised by Cuadra and Simson in 2007 asks whether any locally finitely presented Grothendieck category with enough flat objects also has enough projectives. In this paper, we start from a key observation: a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category has enough flat objects if, and only if, it has exact products. This enables several equivalent reformulations of the problem, allowing us to identify a counterexample (thus providing a negative solution to the problem), while also connecting it to a classical ring-theoretical question posed by Miller in 1975, and even to the Telescope Conjecture for compactly generated triangulated categories. Moreover, we describe several classes of Grothendieck categories where the problem can be answered affirmatively. For example, we show that a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category whose category of finitely presented objects is Krull--Schmidt has enough flats if, and only if, it is generated by a family of finitely generated projectives.</p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We define several versions of a class of varieties $X_{\mathfrak{g}}$ attached to a complex reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, generalizing the Hilbert scheme of points on the plane. These include trigonometric and elliptic versions attached to the corresponding groups. We also define the corresponding isospectral varieties $Y_{\mathfrak{g}}$. We prove a Gordon-Stafford localization theorem for $X_{\mathfrak{g}}$ and the corresponding equal-parameter rational Cherednik algebras, relate these varieties to the affine Springer fiber-sheaf correspondence of arXiv:2204.00303, and discuss examples. We conjecture that the torus-fixed points of our varieties are in bijection with two-sided cells in the finite Weyl group and prove this in types $ABC$. We relate these results to known results about Calogero-Moser spaces.</p></details>
